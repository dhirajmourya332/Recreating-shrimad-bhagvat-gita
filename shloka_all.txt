1.1 Dhritarashtra said  What did my people and the sons of Pandu do when they had assembled
together eager for battle on the holy plain of Kurukshetra, O Sanjaya.
1.1 The King Dhritarashtra asked: "O Sanjaya! What happened on the sacred battlefield of Kurukshetra, when my people gathered against the Pandavas?"
1.1. Dhrtarastra said  O Sanjaya ! What did my men and the sons of Pandu do in the Kuruksetra, the field of  righteousness, where the entire warring class has assembled ?
or
O Sanjaya !  What did the selfish intentions and the intentions born of wisdom do in the human body which is the field-of-duties,  the repository of the senseorgans and in which all the murderous ones (passions and asceticism etc.) are confronting [each other].
1.1 Dhrtarastra said  On the holy field of Kuruksetra, gathered together eager for battle, what did my people and the Pandavas do, O Sanjaya?
1.1. Dhrtarastra said  O Sanjaya, what did my sons (and others) and Pandu's sons (and others) actually do when, eager for battle, they assembled on the sacred field, the Kuruksetra (Field of the Kurus)?
1.1 - 1.19 Dhrtarastra said - Sanjaya said  Duryodhana, after viewing the forces of Pandavas protected by Bhima, and his own forces protected by Bhisma conveyed his views thus to Drona, his teacher, about the adeacy of Bhima's forces for conering the Kaurava forces and the inadeacy of his own forces for victory against the Pandava forces. He was grief-stricken within.

Observing his (Duryodhana's) despondecny, Bhisma, in order to cheer him, roared like a lion, and then blowing his conch, made his side sound their conchs and kettle-drums, which made an uproar as a sign of victory. Then, having heard that great tumult, Arjuna and Sri Krsna the Lord of all lords, who was acting as the charioteer of Arjuna, sitting in their great chariot which was powerful enough to coner the three worlds; blew their divine conchs Srimad Pancajanya and Devadatta. Then, both Yudhisthira and Bhima blew their respective conchs separately. That tumult rent asunder the hearts of your sons, led by Duryodhana. The sons of Dhrtarastra then thought, 'Our cause is almost lost now itself.' So said Sanjaya to Dhrtarastra who was longing for their victory.

Sanjaya said to Dhrtarastra:  Then, seeing the Kauravas, who were ready for battle, Arjuna, who had Hanuman, noted for his exploit of burning Lanka, as the emblem on his flag on his chariot, directed his charioteer Sri Krsna, the Supreme Lord-who is overcome by parental love for those who take shelter in Him who is the treasure-house of knowledge, power, lordship, energy, potency and splendour, whose sportive delight brings about the origin, sustentation and dissolution of the entire cosmos at His will, who is the Lord of the senses, who controls in all ways the senses inner and outer of all, superior and inferior - by saying, 'Station my chariot in an appropriate place in order that I may see exactly my enemies who are eager for battle.'
1.1  Dharmaksetre etc. Here some [authors] offer a different explanation as1 :-Kuruksetra : the man's body is the ksetra i.e., the facilitator, of the kurus, i.e., the sense-organs. 2 The same is the field of all wordly duties, since it is the cuse of their birth; which is also the field of the righteous act that has been described as :

'This is the highest righteous act viz., to realise the Self by means of the Yogas';


and which is the protector4 [of the embodied Self] by achieving emancipation [by means of this], through the destruction of all duties. It is the location where there is the confrontation among all ksatras, the murderous ones-because the root ksad means 'to kill' - viz, passion and asceticism, wrath and forbearance, and others that stand in the mutual relationship of the slayer and the slain. Those that exist in it are the mamakas,-i.e., the intentions that are worthy of man of ignorance and are the products of ignorance-and those that are born of Pandu: i.e., the intentions, of which the soul is the very knowledge itself5 and which are worthy of persons of pure knowledge. What did they do? In other words, which were vanished by what? Mamaka : a man of ignorance as he utters [always] 'mine'6. Pandu : the pure one.7
1.10. "This army of ours marshalled by Bhishma is insufficient,
whereas that army of theirs marshelled by Bhima is sufficient.
1.10 Yet our army seems the weaker, though commanded by Bheeshma; their army seems the stronger, though commanded by Bheema.
1.10. Thus the army guarded by Bhima is unlimited (or insufficient) for us;  on the other hand,  the army guarded by Bhisma is limited  (or sufficient)  for them  (the Pandavas).
1.10 Inadequate is this force of ours, which is guarded by Bhisma, while adequate is that force of theirs, which is guarded by Bhima.
1.10 Therefore, our army under the complete protection of Bhisma and others is unlimited. But this army of these (enemies), under the protection of Bhima and others is limited.
1.1 - 1.19 Dhrtarastra said - Sanjaya said  Duryodhana, after viewing the forces of Pandavas protected by Bhima, and his own forces protected by Bhisma conveyed his views thus to Drona, his teacher, about the adeacy of Bhima's forces for conering the Kaurava forces and the inadeacy of his own forces for victory against the Pandava forces. He was grief-stricken within.

Observing his (Duryodhana's) despondecny, Bhisma, in order to cheer him, roared like a lion, and then blowing his conch, made his side sound their conchs and kettle-drums, which made an uproar as a sign of victory. Then, having heard that great tumult, Arjuna and Sri Krsna the Lord of all lords, who was acting as the charioteer of Arjuna, sitting in their great chariot which was powerful enough to coner the three worlds; blew their divine conchs Srimad Pancajanya and Devadatta. Then, both Yudhisthira and Bhima blew their respective conchs separately. That tumult rent asunder the hearts of your sons, led by Duryodhana. The sons of Dhrtarastra then thought, 'Our cause is almost lost now itself.' So said Sanjaya to Dhrtarastra who was longing for their victory.

Sanjaya said to Dhrtarastra:  Then, seeing the Kauravas, who were ready for battle, Arjuna, who had Hanuman, noted for his exploit of burning Lanka, as the emblem on his flag on his chariot, directed his charioteer Sri Krsna, the Supreme Lord-who is overcome by parental love for those who take shelter in Him who is the treasure-house of knowledge, power, lordship, energy, potency and splendour, whose sportive delight brings about the origin, sustentation and dissolution of the entire cosmos at His will, who is the Lord of the senses, who controls in all ways the senses inner and outer of all, superior and inferior - by saying, 'Station my chariot in an appropriate place in order that I may see exactly my enemies who are eager for battle.'
1.10  Aparyaptam etc. For us, for Pandava army grauded by Bhimasena is unlimited, i.e., it is not possible to vanish; or it is not sufficient, i.e., very insignificant when compared with our army. This is the meaning. On the other hand, for these Pandavas, this army guarded by Bhisma, belonging to us, is limited i.e., it is possible to vanish; or it is sufficient i.e., too much; in other words it is not possible to be vanished in the war by these (Pandavas).
1.11. "Therefore do ye all, stationed in your respective positions,
in the several divisions of the army, protect Bhishma alone."
1.11 Therefore in the rank and file, let stand firm in their posts, according to battalions; and all you generals about Bheeshma.
1.11. Stationed firmly in all  [your]  respective paths,  every one of you without exception should guard Bhisma,  above all.
1.11 Therefore all of you taking your places firmly in your respective divisions, guard Bhisma at all cost.
1.11 However, venerable sirs, all of you without exception, while occupying all the positions in the different directions as alloted (to you respectively), please fully protect Bhisma in particular.
1.1 - 1.19 Dhrtarastra said - Sanjaya said  Duryodhana, after viewing the forces of Pandavas protected by Bhima, and his own forces protected by Bhisma conveyed his views thus to Drona, his teacher, about the adeacy of Bhima's forces for conering the Kaurava forces and the inadeacy of his own forces for victory against the Pandava forces.

Sanjaya said to Dhrtarastra:  Then, seeing the Kauravas, who were ready for battle, Arjuna, who had Hanuman, noted for his exploit of burning Lanka, as the emblem on his flag on his chariot, directed his charioteer Sri Krsna, the Supreme Lord-who is overcome by parental love for those who take shelter in Him who is the treasure-house of knowledge, power, lordship, energy, potency and splendour, whose sportive delight brings about the origin, sustentation and dissolution of the entire cosmos at His will, who is the Lord of the senses, who controls in all ways the senses inner and outer of all, superior and inferior - by saying, 'Station my chariot in an appropriate place in order that I may see exactly my enemies who are eager for battle.'
1.12  1.29  Sri Abhinavgupta did not comment upon this sloka.
1.2. Sanjaya said  Having seen the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battle-array,
King Duryodhana then approached his teacher (Drona) and spoke these words.
1.2 Sanjaya replied: "The Prince Duryodhana, when he saw the army of the Pandavas paraded, approached his preceptor Guru Drona and spoke as follows:
1.2. Sanjaya said  Seeing the army of the sons of Pandu,  marshalled in the military array,  the prince Duryodhana approached the teacher (Drona) and spoke at that time,  these words:
1.2 Sanjaya said   King Duryodhana, on seeing the Pandava army in battle array, approached his teacher Drona and said these words:
1.2 Sanjaya said  But then, seeing the army of the Pandavas in battle array, King Duryodhana approached the teacher (Drona) and uttered a speech:
1.1 - 1.19 Dhrtarastra said - Sanjaya said  Duryodhana, after viewing the forces of Pandavas protected by Bhima, and his own forces protected by Bhisma conveyed his views thus to Drona, his teacher, about the adeacy of Bhima's forces for conering the Kaurava forces and the inadeacy of his own forces for victory against the Pandava forces. He was grief-stricken within.

Observing his (Duryodhana's) despondecny, Bhisma, in order to cheer him, roared like a lion, and then blowing his conch, made his side sound their conchs and kettle-drums, which made an uproar as a sign of victory. Then, having heard that great tumult, Arjuna and Sri Krsna the Lord of all lords, who was acting as the charioteer of Arjuna, sitting in their great chariot which was powerful enough to coner the three worlds; blew their divine conchs Srimad Pancajanya and Devadatta. Then, both Yudhisthira and Bhima blew their respective conchs separately. That tumult rent asunder the hearts of your sons, led by Duryodhana. The sons of Dhrtarastra then thought, 'Our cause is almost lost now itself.' So said Sanjaya to Dhrtarastra who was longing for their victory.

Sanjaya said to Dhrtarastra:  Then, seeing the Kauravas, who were ready for battle, Arjuna, who had Hanuman, noted for his exploit of burning Lanka, as the emblem on his flag on his chariot, directed his charioteer Sri Krsna, the Supreme Lord-who is overcome by parental love for those who take shelter in Him who is the treasure-house of knowledge, power, lordship, energy, potency and splendour, whose sportive delight brings about the origin, sustentation and dissolution of the entire cosmos at His will, who is the Lord of the senses, who controls in all ways the senses inner and outer of all, superior and inferior - by saying, 'Station my chariot in an appropriate place in order that I may see exactly my enemies who are eager for battle.'
1.2 – 1.9  Why this exhaustive counting? The reality of things is this:
1.20. Then, seeing the people of Dhritarashtra’s party standing
arrayed and the discharge of weapons about to begin, Arjuna, the son of
Pandu, whose ensign was a monkey, took up his bow and said the following
to Krishna, O Lord of the earth.
1.20 Then beholding the sons of Dhritarashtra, drawn up on the battle- field, ready to fight, Arjuna, whose flag bore the Hanuman,
1.20. O king!  Then observing Dhrtarastra's men,  arrayed when the armed clash had [virtually] begun,  at that time,  Pandu's son, the monkey-bannered one (Arjuna) raising his bow spoke these sentences.
1.20 Then Arjuna, who had Hanuman as his banner crest, on beholding the sons of Dhrtarastra in array, took up his bow, while missiles were beginning to fly.
1.20  O king, thereafter, seeing Dhrtarastra's men standing in their positions, when all the weapons were ready for action, the son of Pandu (Arjuna) who had the insignia of Hanuman of his chariot-flag, raising up his bow, said the following to Hrsikesa.
1.20 - 1.25 Arjuna said - Sanjaya said  Thus, directed by him, Sri Krsna did immediately as He had been directed, while Bhisma, Drona and others and all the kings were looking on. Such is the prospect of victory for your men.
1.12  1.29  Sri Abhinavgupta did not comment upon this sloka.
1.21 Arjuna said  In the middle between the two armies, place my chariot,
O krishna, so that I may behold those who stand here desirous to fight,
and know with whom I must fight, when the battle is about to commence.
1.21 Raising his bow, spoke this to the Lord Shri Krishna: O Infallible! Lord of the earth! Please draw up my chariot betwixt the two armies,
1.21. Arjuna said  O Acyuta!  Please halt my chariot at a centre place between the two armies,  so that I may scrutinize these men who are standing with desire to fight and with whom I have to fight in this great war-effort.
1.21 And he spoke, O lord of earth, these words to Sri Krsna... Arjuna said: ...Draw up my chariot, O Krsna, between the two armies,
1.21  Arjuna said  O Acyuta, please place my chariot between both the armies  .
1.20 - 1.25 Arjuna said - Sanjaya said  Thus, directed by him, Sri Krsna did immediately as He had been directed, while Bhisma, Drona and others and all the kings were looking on. Such is the prospect of victory for your men.
1.12  1.29  Sri Abhinavgupta did not comment upon this sloka.
1.22. Arjuna said  In the middle between the two armies, place my chariot,
O krishna, so that I may behold those who stand here desirous to fight,
and know with whom I must fight, when the battle is about to commence.
1.22 So that I may observe those who must fight on my side, those who must fight against me;
1.22. I may scrutinize those who are ready to fight,  who have assled here and are eager to achieve in the battle,  what is dear to the evil-minded son of Dhrtarastra.
1.22 So that I may have a good look at those who are standing eager to fight and know with whom I have to fight in this enterprise of war.
1.22   until I survey these who stand intent on fighting, and those who are going to engage in battle with me in this impending war.
1.20 - 1.25 Arjuna said - Sanjaya said  Thus, directed by him, Sri Krsna did immediately as He had been directed, while Bhisma, Drona and others and all the kings were looking on. Such is the prospect of victory for your men.
1.12  1.29  Sri Abhinavgupta did not comment upon this sloka.
1.23. For I desire to observe those who are assembled here to fight,
wishing to please in battle the evil-minded Duryodhana (the son of Dhritarashtra).
1.23 And gaze over this array of soldiers, eager to please the sinful sons of Dhritarashtra."
1.23. - 1.24. Sanjaya said  O descendant of Bharata (Dhrtarastra) !  Thus instructed by Gudakesa (Arjuna), Hrsikesa halted the best chariot at a place in between the two armies,  in front of Bhisma and Drona and of all the rulers of the earth;  and the said:  O son of Prtha! Behold these Kurus,  assembled.
1.23 I wish to see those gathered here ready to fight in this battle in order to please the evil-minded son of Dhrtarastra.
1.23  These who have assembled here and want to accomplish in the war what is dear to the perverted son of Dhrtarastra, I find them to be intent on fighting.
1.20 - 1.25 Arjuna said - Sanjaya said  Thus, directed by him, Sri Krsna did immediately as He had been directed, while Bhisma, Drona and others and all the kings were looking on. Such is the prospect of victory for your men.
1.12  1.29  Sri Abhinavgupta did not comment upon this sloka.
1.24. Sanjaya said  Thus addressed by Arjuna, Krishna, having stationed that
best of chariots, O Dhritarashtra, in the midst of the two armies.
1.24 Sanjaya said: "Having listened to the request of Arjuna, Lord Shri Krishna drew up His bright chariot exactly in the midst between the two armies,
1.23. - 1.24. Sanjaya said  O descendant of Bharata (Dhrtarastra) !  Thus instructed by Gudakesa (Arjuna), Hrsikesa halted the best chariot at a place in between the two armies,  in front of Bhisma and Drona and of all the rulers of the earth;  and the said:  O son of Prtha! Behold these Kurus,  assembled.
1.24 - 1.25 Sanjaya said: Thus addressed by Arjuna, Sri Krsna drew up that best of chariots between the two armies before the view of Bhisma and Drona and all the other kings, O Dhrtarastra, and said, 'O Arjuna, behold these assembled Kauravas.'
1.24  1.25  Sanjay said  O scion of the line of Bharata (Dhrtararastra), Hrsikesa, being told so by Gudakesa (Arjuna), placed the excellent chariot between the two armies, in front of Bhisma and Drona as also all the rulers of the earth, and said, 'O Partha (Arjuna), see these assempled people of the Kuru dynasty.'
1.20 - 1.25 Arjuna said - Sanjaya said  Thus, directed by him, Sri Krsna did immediately as He had been directed, while Bhisma, Drona and others and all the kings were looking on. Such is the prospect of victory for your men.
1.12  1.29  Sri Abhinavgupta did not comment upon this sloka.
1.25. In front of Bhishma and Drona, and all the rulers of the
earth, said: "O Arjuna (son of Pritha), behold these Kurus gathered together."
1.25 Whither Bheeshma and Drona had led all the rulers of the earth, and spoke thus: O Arjuna! Behold these members of the family of Kuru assembled.
1.25. There in both the armies,  the son of Prtha observed his fathers,  and paternal grandfathers,  teachers,  maternal uncles,  brothers,  sons, sons' sons and comrades,  fathers-in-law,  and also friends.
1.24 - 1.25 Sanjaya said: Thus addressed by Arjuna, Sri Krsna drew up that best of chariots between the two armies before the view of Bhisma and Drona and all the other kings, O Dhrtarastra, and said, 'O Arjuna, behold these assembled Kauravas.'
1.24  1.25 Sanjay said  O scion of the line of Bharata (Dhrtararastra), Hrsikesa, being told so by Gudakesa (Arjuna), placed the excellent chariot between the two armies, in front of Bhisma and Drona as also all the rulers of the earth, and said, 'O Partha (Arjuna), see these assempled people of the Kuru dynasty.'

1.26. Then, Arjuna (son of Pritha) saw there (in the armies) stationed,
fathers and grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons
and friends too.
1.26 There Arjuna noticed fathers, grandfathers, uncles, cousins, sons, grandsons, teachers, friends;
1.26. Noticing all those kinsmen arrayed  [in the army],  the son of Kunti was overpowered by unmost compassion;  and being despondent,  he uttered this:
1.26 Then as Arjuna looked on, he saw standing there fathers and grand-fathers, teachers, uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons and comrades;
1.26 Then Partha (Arjuna) saw, marshalled among both the armies, (his) uncles as also grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers (and (cousins), sons, grandsons, as well as comrades and fathers-in-law and friends.
1.26 - 1.47 Arjuna said - Sanjaya said  Sanjaya continued:  The high-minded Arjuna, extremely kind, deeply friendly, and supremely righteous, having brothers like himself, though repeatedly deceived by the treacherous attempts of your people like burning in the lac-house etc., and therefore fit to be killed by him with the help of the Supreme Person, nevertheless said, 'I will not fight.'

He felt weak, overcome as he was by his love and extreme compassion for his relatives. He was also filled with fear, not knowing what was righteous and what unrighteous. His mind was tortured by grief, because of the thought of future separation from his relations. So he threw away his bow and arrow and sat on the chariot as if to fast to death.
1.12  1.29  Sri Abhinavgupta did not comment upon this sloka.
1.27. (He saw) fathers-in-law and friends also in both the armies.
The son of Kunti, Arjuna, seeing all those kinsmen thus standing arrayed,
spoke this, sorrowfully filled with deep pity.
1.27 Fathers-in-law and benefactors, arrayed on both sides. Arjuna then gazed at all those kinsmen before him.
1.27. Arjuna Said  O krsna!  On seeing these war-mongering kinsfolks of my own,  arrayed  [in the armies],  my limbs fail and my mouth goes dry;
1.27 Fathers-in-law and dear friends in both armies. When Arjuna saw all these kinsmen in array,
1.27  The son of Kunti (Ajuna), seeing all those rlatives arrayed (there), became overwhelmed by supreme compassion and said this sorrowfully:
1.26 - 1.47 Arjuna said - Sanjaya said  Sanjaya continued:  The high-minded Arjuna, extremely kind, deeply friendly, and supremely righteous, having brothers like himself, though repeatedly deceived by the treacherous attempts of your people like burning in the lac-house etc., and therefore fit to be killed by him with the help of the Supreme Person, nevertheless said, 'I will not fight.'

1.12  1.29  Sri Abhinavgupta did not comment upon this sloka.
1.28. Arjuna said  Seeing these, my kinsmen, O krishna, arrayed, eager to fight.
1.28 And his heart melted with pity and sadly he spoke: O my Lord! When I see all these, my own people, thirsting for battle,
1.28. Shivering and horripilation arise in my body;  the Gandiva  (the bow)  slips from my hand and my skin also burns all over.
1.28 He was filled with deep compassion and said these words in despair :...Arjuna said:...O Krsna, when I look on these, my kinsmen present here, eager for battle,
1.28 Arjuna said  O Krsna, seeing these relatives and friends who have assembled here with the intention of fighting, my limbs become languid and my mouth becomes completely dry.
1.26 - 1.47 Arjuna said - Sanjaya said Sanjaya continued: The high-minded Arjuna, extremely kind, deeply friendly, and supremely righteous, having brothers like himself, though repeatedly deceived by the treacherous attempts of your people like burning in the lac-house etc., and therefore fit to be killed by him with the help of the Supreme Person, nevertheless said, 'I will not fight.'

1.29. My limbs fail and my mouth is parched, my body ivers and
my hair stands on end.
1.29 My limbs fail me and my throat is parched, my body trembles and my hair stands on end.
1.29. I am unable even to stand steady;  and my mind seems to be confused;  and I see adverse omens,  O Kesava!
1.29 My limbs are weakened, my mouth gets parched, my body trembles and my hairs stand erect.
1.29 And there is trembling in my body, and there is horripillation; the Gandiva (bow) slips from the hand and even the skin burns intensely.
1.26 - 1.47 Arjuna said - Sanjaya said  Sanjaya continued:  The high-minded Arjuna, extremely kind, deeply friendly, and supremely righteous, having brothers like himself, though repeatedly deceived by the treacherous attempts of your people like burning in the lac-house etc., and therefore fit to be killed by him with the help of the Supreme Person, nevertheless said, 'I will not fight.'

1.3. "Behold, O Teacher! this mighty army of the sons of Pandu,
arrayed by the son of Drupada, thy wise disciple.
1.3 Revered Father! Behold this mighty host of the Pandavas, paraded by the son of King Drupada, thy wise disciple.
1.3. O teacher !  Behold this mighty army of  the sons of  Pandu,  marshalled in  a military array by Drupada's son,  your intelligent pupil.
1.3 Behold, O teacher, this mighty army of the Pandavas, arrayed by the son of Drupada, your intelligent disciple.
1.3 O teacher, (please) see this vast army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed for battle by the son of Drupada, your intelligent disciple.
1.1 - 1.19 Dhrtarastra said - Sanjaya said  Duryodhana, after viewing the forces of Pandavas protected by Bhima, and his own forces protected by Bhisma conveyed his views thus to Drona, his teacher, about the adeacy of Bhima's forces for conering the Kaurava forces and the inadeacy of his own forces for victory against the Pandava forces. He was grief-stricken within.

Observing his (Duryodhana's) despondecny, Bhisma, in order to cheer him, roared like a lion, and then blowing his conch, made his side sound their conchs and kettle-drums, which made an uproar as a sign of victory. Then, having heard that great tumult, Arjuna and Sri Krsna the Lord of all lords, who was acting as the charioteer of Arjuna, sitting in their great chariot which was powerful enough to coner the three worlds; blew their divine conchs Srimad Pancajanya and Devadatta. Then, both Yudhisthira and Bhima blew their respective conchs separately. That tumult rent asunder the hearts of your sons, led by Duryodhana. The sons of Dhrtarastra then thought, 'Our cause is almost lost now itself.' So said Sanjaya to Dhrtarastra who was longing for their victory.

Sanjaya said to Dhrtarastra:  Then, seeing the Kauravas, who were ready for battle, Arjuna, who had Hanuman, noted for his exploit of burning Lanka, as the emblem on his flag on his chariot, directed his charioteer Sri Krsna, the Supreme Lord-who is overcome by parental love for those who take shelter in Him who is the treasure-house of knowledge, power, lordship, energy, potency and splendour, whose sportive delight brings about the origin, sustentation and dissolution of the entire cosmos at His will, who is the Lord of the senses, who controls in all ways the senses inner and outer of all, superior and inferior - by saying, 'Station my chariot in an appropriate place in order that I may see exactly my enemies who are eager for battle.'
1.2  1.9  Why this exhaustive counting? The reality of things is this:
1.30. The (bow) Gandiva slips from my hand, and also my skins burns
all over; I am unable even to stand and my mind is reeling, as it were.
1.30 The bow Gandeeva slips from my hand, and my skin burns. I cannot keep quiet, for my mind is in tumult.
1.30. I also do not foresee any good by killing my own kinsmen in the battle.  O Krsna! I wish niether victory,  nor kingdom,  nor the pleasures  [thereof].
1.30 The bow Gandiva slips from my hand and my skin is burning. I can stand no longer. My mind seems to reel.
1.30 Moreover, O Kesava (Krsna), I am not able to stand firmly, and my mind seems to be whirling. And I notice the omens to be adverse.
1.26 - 1.47 Arjuna said - Sanjaya said  Sanjaya continued:  The high-minded Arjuna, extremely kind, deeply friendly, and supremely righteous, having brothers like himself, though repeatedly deceived by the treacherous attempts of your people like burning in the lac-house etc., and therefore fit to be killed by him with the help of the Supreme Person, nevertheless said, 'I will not fight.'

1.30 – 1.34  Na ca sreyah, etc., upto mahikrte. Those who are wrongly conceived as object of slaying, with the individualizing idea that 'these are my teachers etc.'8 would necessarily generate sin. Similarly, the act of slaying even of those deserving to be slain in the battle-if undertaken with the idea that 'This battle is to be fought for the apparent results like pleasures, happiness etc.'- then it generates sin necessarily. This idea lurks in the objection [of Arjuna]. That is why a reply is going to be given [by Bhagavat] as 'You must undertake actions simply as your own duty, and not with an individualizing idea'.
1.31. And I see adverse omens, O Kesava. I do not see any good
in killing my kinsmen in battle.
1.31 The omens are adverse; what good can come from the slaughter of my people on this battlefield?
1.31. O Govinda!  Of  what use in the kingdom to us?  Of  what use are the pleasures [thereof]  and the life even?
1.31 I see, Krsna, inauspicious omens. I foresee no good in killing my kinsmen in the fight.
1.31 Besides, I do not see any good (to be derived) from killing my own people in battle. O Krsna, I do not hanker after victory, nor even a kingdom nor pleasures.
1.26 - 1.47 Arjuna said - Sanjaya said  Sanjaya continued:  The high-minded Arjuna, extremely kind, deeply friendly, and supremely righteous, having brothers like himself, though repeatedly deceived by the treacherous attempts of your people like burning in the lac-house etc., and therefore fit to be killed by him with the help of the Supreme Person, nevertheless said, 'I will not fight.'

1.32. I desire not victory, O Krishna, nor kingdom, nor pleasures.
Of what avail is dominion to us, O Krishna, or pleasures or even life?
1.32 Ah my Lord! I crave not for victory, nor for the kingdom, nor for any pleasure. What were a kingdom or happiness or life to me,
1.32. For whose sake we seek kingdom,  [its] pleasures and happiness,  the very same persons stand arrayed to fight,  giving up their life and wealth.
1.32 I desire no victory, nor empire, nor pleasures. What have we to do with empire, O Krsna, or enjoyment or even life ?
1.32  1.34  O Govinda! What need do we have of a kingdom, or what (need) of enjoyments and livelihood? Those for whom kingdom, enjoyments and pleasures ae desired by us, viz teachers, uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law as also relatives-those very ones stand arrayed for battle risking their lives and wealth.
1.26 - 1.47 Arjuna said - Sanjaya said Sanjaya continued: The high-minded Arjuna, extremely kind, deeply friendly, and supremely righteous, having brothers like himself, though repeatedly deceived by the treacherous attempts of your people like burning in the lac-house etc., and therefore fit to be killed by him with the help of the Supreme Person, nevertheless said, 'I will not fight.'

1.33. Those for whose sake we desire kingdom, enjoyments and pleasures,
stand here in battle, having renounced life and wealth.
1.33 When those for whose sake I desire these things stand here about to sacrifice their property and their lives:
1.33. [These are our] teachers, fathers, sons and also paternal grandfathers, maternal uncles,  fathers-in-law,  son's sons,  wives' brothers,  and (other) relatives.
1.33 Those for whose sake we do desire empire, enjoyment and pleasures, stand here in war renouncing life and wealth----

them for the sake of the earth.
1.35 I would not kill them, even for three worlds; why then for this poor earth? It matters not if I myself am killed.
1.35. By slaying Dhrtarastra's sons what joy would be to go us, O Janardana?
1.35 These I would not slay, though they might slay me, even for the sovereignty of the three worlds - how much less for this earth O Krsna?
1.35 O Madhusudana, even if I am killed, I do not want to kill these even for the sake of a kingdom extending over the three worlds; what to speak of doing so for the earth!
1.26 - 1.47 Arjuna said - Sanjaya said  Sanjaya continued:  The high-minded Arjuna, extremely kind, deeply friendly, and supremely righteous, having brothers like himself, though repeatedly deceived by the treacherous attempts of your people like burning in the lac-house etc., and therefore fit to be killed by him with the help of the Supreme Person, nevertheless said, 'I will not fight.'

He felt weak, overcome as he was by his love and extreme compassion for his relatives. He was also filled with fear, not knowing what was righteous and what unrighteous. His mind was tortured by grief, because of the thought of future separation from his relations. So he threw away his bow and arrow and sat on the chariot as if to fast to death.
1.35 – 1.44  Nihatya etc. upto anususruma. Sin alone is the agent in the act of slaying these desperadoes. Therefore here the idea is this : These ememies of ours have been slain, i.e., have been take possession of, by sin. Sin would come to us also after slaying them. Sin in this context is the disregard, on account of greed etc., to the injurious conseences like the ruination of the family and the like. That is why Arjuna makes a specific mention of the [ruin of the] family etc., and of its duties in the passage 'How by slaying my own kinsmen etc'.

The act of slaying, undertaken with an individualizing idea about its result, and with a particularizing idea about the person to be slain, is a great sin. To say this very thing precisely and to indicate the intensity of his own agony, Arjuna says only to himself [see next sloka]:
1.36. By killing these sons of Dhritarashtra, what pleasure can
be ours, O Janardana? Only sin will accrue to us from killing these felons.
1.36 My Lord! What happiness can come from the death of these sons of Dhritarashtra? We shall sin if we kill these desperate men.
1.36. Nothing but sin would slay these desperadoes and take hold of us.  Therefore we should not slay Dhrtarastra's sons, our own relatives.
1.36 If we kill the sons of Dhrtarastra, what joy will be ours, O Krsna? Sin alone will accrue to us if we kill these murderous felons.
1.36  O Janardana, what happiness shall we derive by killing the sons of Dhrtarastra? Sin alone will accrue to us by killing these felons.

1.37. Therefore, we should not kill the sons of Dhritarashtra,
our relatives; for how can we be happy by killing our own people, O Madhava
(Krishna)?
1.37 We are worthy of a nobler feat than to slaughter our relatives - the sons of Dhritarashtra; for, my Lord, how can we be happy of we kill our kinsmen?
1.37. How could we be happy indeed,  O Madhava,  after  slaying our own kinsmen ?
1.37 Therefore, it is not befitting that we slay our kin, the sons of Dhrtarastra. For if we kill our kinsmen, O Krsna, how indeed can we be happy?
1.37  Therefore, it is not proper for us to kill the sons of Dhrtarastra who are our own relatives. For, O Madhava, how can we be happy by killing our kinsmen?

no evil in the destruction of families, and no sin in hostility to friends,
1.38 Although these men, blinded by greed, see no guilt in destroying their kin, or fighting against their friends,
1.38. Of course,  these (Dhrtarastra's sons),  with their intellect overpowered by greed, do not see the evil conseences ensuing from the ruin of the family and the sin in cheating friends.
1.38 Though these people, whose minds are overpowered by greed, see no evil in the destruction of a clan and no sin in treachery to friends,
1.38  1.39  O Janardana, although these people, whose hearts have become perverted by greed, do not see the evil arising from destroying the family and sin in hostility towards, friends, yet how can we who clearly see the evil arising from destroying the family remain unaware of (the need of) abstaining from this sin?

of families, learn to turn away from this sin, O Janardana (Krishna)?
1.39 Should not we, whose eyes are open, who consider it to be wrong to annihilate our house, turn away from so great a crime?
1.39. But,  perceiving clearly the evil conseences ensuing from the ruin of the family, should we not have a sense to refrain from this sinful act  [of fighting the war],  O Janardana ?
1.39 Why should we not learn to shun this crime - we who see the evil of ruining a clan, O Krsna?
1.38  1.39 O Janardana, although these people, whose hearts have become perverted by greed, do not see the evil arising from destroying the family and sin in hostility towards, friends, yet how can we who clearly see the evil arising from destroying the family remain unaware of (the need of) abstaining from this sin?

1.4. Here are heroes, mighty archers, eal in battle to Bhima
and Arjuna, Yoyudhana (Satyaki), Virata and Drupada, of the great car (mighty
warriors).
1.4 In it are heroes and great bowmen; the equals in battle of Arjuna and Bheema, Yuyudhana, Virata and Drupada, great soldiers all;
1.4. The heroes and mighty archers, comparable in war to Bhima and Arjuna,  here are:  Yuyudhana,  the king of the Virata country,  and Drupada,  the mighty warrior;
1.4 There (in that army) are heroes, great bowmen, like Bhima and Arjuna; Yuyudhana,Virata and Drupada a mighty warrior;
1.4 Here are the heroes wielding great bows, who in battle are compeers of Bhima and Arjuna: Yuyudhana (Satyaki) and Virata, and the maharatha (great chariot-rider) Drupada;
1.1 - 1.19 Dhrtarastra said - Sanjaya said  Duryodhana, after viewing the forces of Pandavas protected by Bhima, and his own forces protected by Bhisma conveyed his views thus to Drona, his teacher, about the adeacy of Bhima's forces for conering the Kaurava forces and the inadeacy of his own forces for victory against the Pandava forces. He was grief-stricken within.

Observing his (Duryodhana's) despondecny, Bhisma, in order to cheer him, roared like a lion, and then blowing his conch, made his side sound their conchs and kettle-drums, which made an uproar as a sign of victory. Then, having heard that great tumult, Arjuna and Sri Krsna the Lord of all lords, who was acting as the charioteer of Arjuna, sitting in their great chariot which was powerful enough to coner the three worlds; blew their divine conchs Srimad Pancajanya and Devadatta. Then, both Yudhisthira and Bhima blew their respective conchs separately. That tumult rent asunder the hearts of your sons, led by Duryodhana. The sons of Dhrtarastra then thought, 'Our cause is almost lost now itself.' So said Sanjaya to Dhrtarastra who was longing for their victory.

Sanjaya said to Dhrtarastra:  Then, seeing the Kauravas, who were ready for battle, Arjuna, who had Hanuman, noted for his exploit of burning Lanka, as the emblem on his flag on his chariot, directed his charioteer Sri Krsna, the Supreme Lord-who is overcome by parental love for those who take shelter in Him who is the treasure-house of knowledge, power, lordship, energy, potency and splendour, whose sportive delight brings about the origin, sustentation and dissolution of the entire cosmos at His will, who is the Lord of the senses, who controls in all ways the senses inner and outer of all, superior and inferior - by saying, 'Station my chariot in an appropriate place in order that I may see exactly my enemies who are eager for battle.'
1.2  1.9  Why this exhaustive counting? The reality of things is this:
1.40. In the destruction of a family, the immemorial religious
rites of that family perish; on the destruction of spirituality, impiety,
indeed, overcomes the whole family.
1.40 The destruction of our kindred means the destruction of the traditions of our ancient lineage, and when these are lost, irreligion will overrun our homes.
1.40. When  a family ruins,  the etnernal duties of the family perish;  when the duties perish,  impiety inevitably dominates the entire family.
1.40 With the ruin of a clan, perish its ancient traditions, and when traditions perish, lawlessness overtakes the whole clan
1.40  From the ruin of the family are totally destroyed the traditional rites and duties of the family. When rites and duties are destroyed, vice overpowers the entire family also.

the family become corrupt; and , women being corrupted, O Varshenya (descendant
of Vrishni), there arises intermingling of castes.
1.41 When irreligion spreads, the women of the house begin to stray; when they lose their purity, adulteration of the stock follows.
1.41. Because of the domination of impiety,  O Krsna,  the women of the family become corrupt;  when the women become corrupt,  O member of the Vrsni-clan, there arises the intermixture of castes;
1.41 When lawlessness prevails, O Krsna, the women of the clan become corrupt; when women become corrupt, there arises intermixture of classes.
1.41  O Krsna, when vice predominates, the women of the family become corrupt. O descendent of the Vrsnis, when women become corrupted, it results in the intermingling of castes.

for their forefathers fall, deprived of the offerings of rice-ball and
water (libations).
1.42 Promiscuity ruins both the family and those who defile it; while the souls of our ancestors droop, through lack of the funeral cakes and ablutions.
1.42. The intermixture leads the family-ruiners and the family to nothing but the hell; for,  their ancestors  (their individual souls)  fall down  [in hell],  being deprived of the rites of offering rice-balls and water  [intended to them].
1.42 This mixing of classes leads to hell the clan itself and its destroyers; for the spirits of their ancestors fall degraded, deprived of the ritual offerings of food and water.
1.42  And the intermingling in the family leads the ruiners of the family verily into hell. The forefathers of these fall down (into hell) because of being deprived of the offerings of rice-balls and water.

1.43. On account of these evils of the family-ruiners that cause the intermixture of castes,  the eternal caste-duties and family-duties fall into disuse.
1.43 By the sins of the clan-destroyers who bring about inter-mixture of classes, the ancient traditions of the clan and class are destroyed.

1.44. O Janardana!  Dwelling in the hell is ite certain for men with their family-duties fallen into disuse:  this we have heard.

1.45  Aho bata etc. We denotes one and all who were divided [into the opposite campus] by the division among the Kauravas and the Pandavas.

When every one is indiscriminate, what act is proper for me, while I am endowed with the faculty to discriminate? Of course, it is proper to turn back from the battle. Yet, says [Arjuna], what is much more proper is this [see next sloka]:
1.46. If the sons of Dhritarashtra with weapons in hand should
slay me in battle, unresisting and unarmed, that would be better for me.
1.46 If, on the contrary, the sons of Dhritarashtra, with weapons in their hand, should slay me, unarmed and unresisting, surely that would be better for my welfare!"
1.46. It would be more beneficial for me if Dhrtarastra's men with weapons in their hands, should slay me, unresisting and unarmed.
1.46 If the well-armed sons of Dhrtarastra should slay me in battle, unresisting and unarmed, that will be better for me.
1.46  If, in this battle, the sons of Dhrtarastra armed with weapons kill me who am non-resistant and unarmed, that will be more beneficial to me.

1.47. Sanjaya said  Having thus spoken in the midst of the battlefield, Arjuna,
casting away his bow and arrow, sat down on the seat of the chariot with
his mind overwhelmed with sorrow.
1.47 Sanjaya said: "Having spoken thus, in the midst of the armies, Arjuna sank on the seat of the chariot, casting away his bow and arrow; heartbroken with grief."
1.47. Sanjaya  said  Having said this much about the battle,  and letting his bow fall with arrows, Arjuna sat down on the back of  the chariot,  with his mind agitated with grief.
1.47 Sanjaya said : Having spoken thus on the battle-field, Arjuna threw aside his how and arrows and sat down on the seat of the chariot, his heart overwhelmed with grief.
1.47 Sanjaya narrated: Having said so, Arjuna, with a mind afflicted with sorrow, sat down on the chariot in the midst of the battle, casting aside the bow along with the arrows.

He felt weak, overcome as he was by his love and extreme compassion for his relatives. He was also filled with fear, not knowing what was righteous and what unrighteous. His mind was tortured by grief, because of the thought of future separation from his relations. So he threw away his bow and arrow and sat on the chariot as if to fast to death. 1.47. Sanjaya  said  Having said this much about the battle,  and letting his bow fall with arrows, Arjuna sat down on the back of  the chariot,  with his mind agitated with grief.

1.47 Sanjaya said: "Having spoken thus, in the midst of the armies, Arjuna sank on the seat of the chariot, casting away his bow and arrow; heartbroken with grief."
1.5. "Dhrishtaketu, chekitana and the valiant king of Kasi, Purujit
and Kuntibhoja and Saibya, the best men.
1.5 Dhrishtaketu, Chekitan, the valiant King of Benares, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, Shaibya - a master over many;
1.5. Dhrstaketu,  Cekitana and the valourous king of Kasi,  and Kuntibhoja,  the coneror of many,   and the Sibi king,   the best among men;
1.5 Dhrstaketu, Cekitana, and the valiant king of Kasi; Purujit and Kuntibhoja, and Saibya the best among men;
1.5 Dhrstaketu, Cekitana, and the valiant king of Kasi (Varanasi); Purujit and Kuntibhoja, and Saibya, the choicest among men;
1.1 - 1.19 Dhrtarastra said - Sanjaya said  Duryodhana, after viewing the forces of Pandavas protected by Bhima, and his own forces protected by Bhisma conveyed his views thus to Drona, his teacher, about the adeacy of Bhima's forces for conering the Kaurava forces and the inadeacy of his own forces for victory against the Pandava forces. He was grief-stricken within.

Observing his (Duryodhana's) despondecny, Bhisma, in order to cheer him, roared like a lion, and then blowing his conch, made his side sound their conchs and kettle-drums, which made an uproar as a sign of victory. Then, having heard that great tumult, Arjuna and Sri Krsna the Lord of all lords, who was acting as the charioteer of Arjuna, sitting in their great chariot which was powerful enough to coner the three worlds; blew their divine conchs Srimad Pancajanya and Devadatta. Then, both Yudhisthira and Bhima blew their respective conchs separately. That tumult rent asunder the hearts of your sons, led by Duryodhana. The sons of Dhrtarastra then thought, 'Our cause is almost lost now itself.' So said Sanjaya to Dhrtarastra who was longing for their victory.

Sanjaya said to Dhrtarastra:  Then, seeing the Kauravas, who were ready for battle, Arjuna, who had Hanuman, noted for his exploit of burning Lanka, as the emblem on his flag on his chariot, directed his charioteer Sri Krsna, the Supreme Lord-who is overcome by parental love for those who take shelter in Him who is the treasure-house of knowledge, power, lordship, energy, potency and splendour, whose sportive delight brings about the origin, sustentation and dissolution of the entire cosmos at His will, who is the Lord of the senses, who controls in all ways the senses inner and outer of all, superior and inferior - by saying, 'Station my chariot in an appropriate place in order that I may see exactly my enemies who are eager for battle.'
1.2  1.9  Why this exhaustive counting? The reality of things is this:
1.6. "The strong Yodhamanyu and the brave Uttamaujas, the son
of Subhadra (Abhimanyu, the son of Subhadra and Arjuna), and the sons of
Draupadi, all of great chariots (great heroes).
1.6 Yudhamanyu, Uttamouja, Soubhadra and the sons of Droupadi, famous men.
1.6. And Yudhamanyu,  the heroic,  and Uttamaujas,  the valourous,  the son of Subhadra and the sons of Draupadiall are indeed mighty warriors.
1.6 Yudhamanyu the valiant, and Uttamaujas the strong; and also the son of Subhadra and the sons of Draupadi, all mighty warriors.
1.6 And the chivalrous Yudhamanyu, and the valiant Uttamaujas; son of Subhadra (Abhimanyu) and the sons of Draupadi  all (of whom) are, verily, maharathas.

1.2  1.9  Why this exhaustive counting? The reality of things is this:
10.1 The Blessed Lord said  Again, O mighty-armed Arjuna, listen to my supreme word which I will declare to thee who who art beloved, for thy welfare.
10.1 "Lord Shri Krishna said: Now, O Prince! Listen to My supreme advice, which I give thee for the sake of thy welfare, for thou art My beloved.
10.1. The Bhagavat said  O mighty-armed  [Arjuna] !  Yet, again listen to My best message, which, with good intention, I shall declare to you, who are dear to Me.
10.1 The Lord said  Further said, O Arjuna, listen to My Supreme word. Desirous of your good, I shall speak to you who love Me.
10.1 The Blessed Lord said  O mighty-armed one, listen over again ot My supreme utterance, which I, wishing your welfare, shall speak to you who take delight (in it).
10.1 The Lord said  Listen with rapt attention to these words which I shall utter - words which are supreme and which give you a much wider understanding of My greatness. I shall speak out to  you about the rise and growth of devotion to Me, as you are pleased with listening to My greatness and as I too love you.
10.1 See Comment under 10.5
10.1 O mighty-armed one, srnu, listen; bhuyah eva, over agiain; me, to My; paramam, supreme; vacah, utterance, which is expressive of the transcendental Reality; yat, which supreme Truth; aham, I; vaksyami, shall speak; te, to you; priyamanaya, who take delight (in it). You become greatly pleased by My utterance, like one drinking ambrosia. Hence, I shall speak to you hita-kamyaya, wishing your welfare.
'Why shall I speak?' In answer to this the Lord says:
10.10 To them who are ever steadfast, worshipping Me with love, I give the Yoga of discrimination by which they come to Me.
10.10 To those who are always devout and who worship Me with love, I give the power of discrimination, which leads them to Me.
10.10. To these persons, who are [thus] mingling  [with Me]  and revere  [Me] with love, I grant that knowledge-Yoga by means of which they reach Me.
10.10 To those, who are ceaselessly united with Me and who worship Me with immense love, I lovingly grant that mental disposition (Buddhi-yoga) by which they come to Me.
10.10 To them who are ever devoted and worship Me with love, I grant that possession of wisdom by which they reach Me.
10.10 To those 'ceaselessly united with Me,' namely, those who desire ceaseless union with Me, and who are worshipping Me, I grant with love, that same 'Buddhi-yoga' or devotional attitude of a mature state. By that they come to Me.

Likewise:
10.10 See Comment under 10.11
10.10 Tesam, to them, who, becoming devotees, adore Me in the manner described earlier; satata-yuktanam, who are ever devoted, ever attached, who have become free from all external desires; and bhajatam, who worship-. Is it because of hankering for possessions? The Lord says: No, (they worship) priti-purvakam, with love. To them who worship Me with that (love), dadami, I grant; tam, that; buddhi-yogam, possession of wisdom-buddhi means full enlightenment with regard to My real nature; coming in possession (yoga) of that is buddhi-yoga; yena, by which possession of wisdom consisting in full enlightenment; upayanti, they reach, realize as their own Self; mam, Me, the supreme God who is the Self. Who do so? Te, they, who adore Me through such disciplines as fixing their minds on Me, etc.
'For what purpose, or as the destroyer of what cause standing as an obstacle on the way of reaching You, do You bestow that possession of wisdom to those devotees of Yours?'
In reply to such a ery the Lord says:
10.11 Out of mere compassion for them, I, dwelling within their Self, destroy the darkness born of ignorance by the luminous lamp of knowledge.
10.11 By My grace, I live in their hearts; and I dispel the darkness of ignorance by the shining light of wisdom.
10.11. Out of compassion only towards these men, I, who remain as their very Self, destroy with teh shining light of wisdom, their darkness born of ignorance,
10.11 Out of compassion for them alone, I, abiding in their mental activity as its object, dispel the darkness born of ignorance by the brilliant lamp of knowledge.
10.11 Out of compassion for them alone, I, residing in their hearts, destroy the darkness born of ignorance with the luminous lamp of Knowledge.
10.11 To show favour to them alone, abiding in their mental activity, i.e., established as the object of thought in their mind, and manifesting the host of My auspicious attributes by the brillinat lamp called knowledge relating to Me, - I dispel the darkness incompatible with knowledge. This darkness is born of ignorance in the form of old Karma consisting of attachment to objects other than Myself, to which they were previously habituated.

Thus having heard of the Lord as having a host of auspicious attributes, and of the extent of His sovereign glories which are unie and different from all others and which generate unsurpassed bliss in listeners, - Arjuna desired to listen to the details about them and said:
10.9-11 Maharsaya  etc.,  upto  bhasvata.  Through the process of mutual  enlightening,  the wisdom-shock is transmitted to each other.  On account of that, they get the all-inclusive  [knowledge]  'Indeed all sentient  subjects are only a single  Absolute  Lord'.  By means of this extensive pervasion,  they easily  come to realise  their own Self as Omnipotent and omnipresent and by that they attain the Absolute Lordship.  This is the idea here.
10.11 Anukampartham, out of compassion; tesam eva, for them alone, anxious as to how they may have bliss; aham, I; atmabhavasthah, residing in their hearts-atmabhavah means the seat that is the heart; being seated there itself; nasayami, destroy; tamah, the darkness; ajnanajam, born of ignorance, originating from non-discrimination, the darkness of delusion known as false comprehension; jnana-dipena, with the lamp of Knowledge, in the form of discriminating comprehension; i.e. bhasvata, with the luminous lamp of Knowledge-fed by the oil of divine grace resulting from devotion, fanned by the wind of intensity of meditation on Me, having the wick of the intellect imbued with the impressions arising from such disciplines as celibacy etc., in the receptacle of the detached mind, placed in the windless shelter of the mind withdrawn from objects and untainted by likes and dislikes, and made luminous by full Illumination resulting from the practice of constant concentration and meditation.
After hearing the above-described majesty and yoga of the Lord,
10.12 Arjuna said  Thou art the Supreme Brahman, the supreme abode (or the supreme light), the supreme purifier, eternal, divine Person, the primeval God, unborn andn omnipresent.
10.12 Arjuna asked: Thou art the Supreme Spirit, the Eternal Home, the Holiest of the Holy, the Eternal Divine Self, the Primal God, the Unborn and the Omnipresent.
10.12. - 10.13. Arjuna said  You are the Supreme Brahman, Supreme Abode, Supreme Purifier.  All the seers and also the divine seer Narada, Asita Devala, Vyasa describe You as the Eternal Divine Soul,  the unborn, all-manifesting First-God.  You too say so to me.
10.12 - 10.13 Arjuna said  You are Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Light, and the Supreme Sanctifier. All the seers proclaim You as the eternal, divine Person, the Primal Lord, the unborn and all-pervading. So also proclaim the divine sages Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa. You Yourself also proclaim this.
10.12-10.13 Arjuna said  You are the supreme Brahman, the supreme Light, the supreme Sanctifier. All the sages as also the divine sage Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa [Although Narada and the other sages are already mentioned by the words 'all the sages', still they are named separately because of their eminence. Asita is the father of Devala.] call You the eternal divine Person, the Primal God, the Birthless, the Omnipresent; and You Yourself verily tell me (so).
10.12 - 10.13 Arjuna said  You are He whom the Srutis proclaim as the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Light, the Supreme Sanctifier. Thus the Srutis assert:  'From whom all these beings are born, by whom, when born, they live and unto whom they go when they perish - desire to know that well. This is Brahman' (Tai. U., 3.1.1); 'He who knows Brahman attains the Highest' (Ibid., 2.1.1); and 'He who knows the Supreme Brahman becomes the Brahman' (Mun. U., 3.2.9). Likewise He is the Supreme Light. The term 'Dhaman' connotes light. He is the Supreme Light as taught (in the Upanisads):  'Now, the light which shines higher than this heaven ৷৷.' (Cha. U., 3.13. 7); 'Attaining the Supreme Light. He appears with His own form' (Ibid., 8.12.2); 'The gods worship Him as the Light of lights' (Br. U., 4.4.16). So also He is the Supreme Sanctifier:  He makes the meditator bereft of all the impurities, and also destroyes them without any trace. The Srutis declares:  'As water clings not to the leaf of a lotus-flower, so evil deeds cling not to him who knows thus' (Cha. U., 4.14.3):  'Just as the fibre of Isika reed (reed-cotton) laid on a fire is burnt up, so also all his sins are burnt up' (Ibid., 5.24.3); and 'Narayana is Supreme Brahman, Narayana is Supreme Light, Narayana is Supreme Self' (Ma. Na., 9.4).

Sages are those who know in reality the higher truth (the Supreme Brahman), and the lower truth (individual selves); they speak of You as the eternal Divine Person, Primal Lord, the unborn and all-pervading. So also divine sage Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa declare:  'This Narayana, Lord of Sri, the resident of the Milk Ocean, has come to the city of Mathura abandoning his Serpent-couch.' 'Where Madhusudana is, there is the blessed Dvaravati. He is the Lord Himself, the ancient One and Eternal Dharma (Ma. Bh. Vana. 88. 24-25). Those who know the Vedas and those who know the self declare the great-minded Krsna to be the eternal Dharma. Of all sanctifiers, Govinda is said to be the most sanctifying, the most auspicious among the auspicious. The lotus-eyed God of gods, the eternal, abides as the three worlds ৷৷. Hari who is beyond thought, abides thus. Madhusudana is there alone' (Ma. Bha. Vana., 88.24-28). Similarly it is stated:  'O Arjuna, where the divine, the eternal Narayana the Supreme Self is, there the entire universe, the sacred water and the holy shrines are to be found. That is sacred, that is Supreme Brahman, that is sacred waters, that is the austerity grove ৷৷. there dwell the divine sages, the Siddhas and all those rich in austerities where the Primal Lord, the agent Yogin Madhusudana dwells. It is the most sacred among the sacred. For you, let there be no doubt about this' (Ibid., 90.28-32); 'Krsna Himself is the origin and dissolution of all beings. For, this universe, consisting of sentient and non-sentient entities, was generated for the sake of Krsna' (Ma. Bha. Sabha., 38.23). And you yourself say so in the passage beginning with 'Earth, water, fire, ether, mind, intellect and Ahankara - this Prakrti, which is divided eightfold, is Mine' (7.4) and ending with 'I am the origin of all; from Me proceed everything' (10.8).
10.12 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
10.12 Bhavan, You; are the param brahma, supreme Brahman, the supreme Self; the param dhama, supreme Light; the paramam pavitram, supreme Sanctifier. Sarve, all; rsayah, the sages-Vasistha and others; tatha, as also; the devarisih, divine sage; naradah, Narada; Asita and Devala ahuh, call; tvam, You; thus: Sasvatam, the eternal; divyam, divine; purusam, Person; adi-devam, the Primal God, the God who preceded all the gods; ajam, the birthless; vibhum, the Omnipresent-capable of assuming diverse forms. And even Vyasa also speaks in this very way. Ca, and; svayam, You Yourself; eva, verily; bravisi, tell; me, me (so).
10.13 All the sages have thus declared Thee, as also the divine sage Narada; so also Asita, Devala and Vyasa; and now Thou Thyself sayest so to me.
10.13 So have said the seers and the divine sage Narada; as well as Asita, Devala and Vyasa; and Thou Thyself also sayest it.
10.12. - 10.13. Arjuna said  You are the Supreme Brahman, Supreme Abode, Supreme Purifier.  All the seers and also the divine seer Narada, Asita Devala, Vyasa describe You as the Eternal Divine Soul,  the unborn, all-manifesting First-God.  You too say so to me.
10.12 - 10.13 Arjuna said  You are Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Light, and the Supreme Sanctifier. All the seers proclaim You as the eternal, divine Person, the Primal Lord, the unborn and all-pervading. So also proclaim the divine sages Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa. You Yourself also proclaim this.
10.12-10.13 Arjuna said  You are the supreme Brahman, the supreme Light, the supreme Sanctifier. All the sages as also the divine sage Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa [Although Narada and the other sages are already mentioned by the words 'all the sages', still they are named separately because of their eminence. Asita is the father of Devala.] call You the eternal divine Person, the Primal God, the Birthless, the Omnipresent; and You Yourself verily tell me (so).
10.12 - 10.13 Arjuna said  You are He whom the Srutis proclaim as the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Light, the Supreme Sanctifier. Thus the Srutis assert:  'From whom all these beings are born, by whom, when born, they live and unto whom they go when they perish - desire to know that well. This is Brahman' (Tai. U., 3.1.1); 'He who knows Brahman attains the Highest' (Ibid., 2.1.1); and 'He who knows the Supreme Brahman becomes the Brahman' (Mun. U., 3.2.9). Likewise He is the Supreme Light. The term 'Dhaman' connotes light. He is the Supreme Light as taught (in the Upanisads):  'Now, the light which shines higher than this heaven ৷৷.' (Cha. U., 3.13. 7); 'Attaining the Supreme Light. He appears with His own form' (Ibid., 8.12.2); 'The gods worship Him as the Light of lights' (Br. U., 4.4.16). So also He is the Supreme Sanctifier:  He makes the meditator bereft of all the impurities, and also destroyes them without any trace. The Srutis declares:  'As water clings not to the leaf of a lotus-flower, so evil deeds cling not to him who knows thus' (Cha. U., 4.14.3):  'Just as the fibre of Isika reed (reed-cotton) laid on a fire is burnt up, so also all his sins are burnt up' (Ibid., 5.24.3); and 'Narayana is Supreme Brahman, Narayana is Supreme Light, Narayana is Supreme Self' (Ma. Na., 9.4).

Sages are those who know in reality the higher truth (the Supreme Brahman), and the lower truth (individual selves); they speak of You as the eternal Divine Person, Primal Lord, the unborn and all-pervading. So also divine sage Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa declare:  'This Narayana, Lord of Sri, the resident of the Milk Ocean, has come to the city of Mathura abandoning his Serpent-couch.' 'Where Madhusudana is, there is the blessed Dvaravati. He is the Lord Himself, the ancient One and Eternal Dharma (Ma. Bh. Vana. 88. 24-25). Those who know the Vedas and those who know the self declare the great-minded Krsna to be the eternal Dharma. Of all sanctifiers, Govinda is said to be the most sanctifying, the most auspicious among the auspicious. The lotus-eyed God of gods, the eternal, abides as the three worlds ৷৷. Hari who is beyond thought, abides thus. Madhusudana is there alone' (Ma. Bha. Vana., 88.24-28). Similarly it is stated:  'O Arjuna, where the divine, the eternal Narayana the Supreme Self is, there the entire universe, the sacred water and the holy shrines are to be found. That is sacred, that is Supreme Brahman, that is sacred waters, that is the austerity grove ৷৷. there dwell the divine sages, the Siddhas and all those rich in austerities where the Primal Lord, the agent Yogin Madhusudana dwells. It is the most sacred among the sacred. For you, let there be no doubt about this' (Ibid., 90.28-32); 'Krsna Himself is the origin and dissolution of all beings. For, this universe, consisting of sentient and non-sentient entities, was generated for the sake of Krsna' (Ma. Bha. Sabha., 38.23). And you yourself say so in the passage beginning with 'Earth, water, fire, ether, mind, intellect and Ahankara - this Prakrti, which is divided eightfold, is Mine' (7.4) and ending with 'I am the origin of all; from Me proceed everything' (10.8).
10.13 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
10.13 Bhavan, You; are the param brahma, supreme Brahman, the supreme Self; the param dhama, supreme Light; the paramam pavitram, supreme Sanctifier. Sarve, all; rsayah, the sages-Vasistha and others; tatha, as also; the devarisih, divine sage; naradah, Narada; Asita and Devala ahuh, call; tvam, You; thus: Sasvatam, the eternal; divyam, divine; purusam, Person; adi-devam, the Primal God, the God who preceded all the gods; ajam, the birthless; vibhum, the Omnipresent-capable of assuming diverse forms. And even Vyasa also speaks in this very way. Ca, and; svayam, You Yourself; eva, verily; bravisi, tell; me, me (so).
10.14 I believe all this that Thou sayest to me to be true, O Krishna; verily, O blessed Lord! neither the gods nor the demons know Thy manifestation (origin).
10.14 I believe in what Thou hast said, my Lord! For neither the godly not the godless comprehend Thy manifestation.
10.14. What You tell me, I take all to be true, O Kesava !  For, O Bhagavat, neither the gods nor the great seers know Your manifestation.
10.14 I deem as true all this that you say to Me, O Krsna. Verily O Lord, neither the gods nor the demons know Your manifestation.
10.14 O Kesava, I accept to be true all this which You tell me. Certainly, O Lord, neither the gods nor the demons comprehend Your glory.
10.14 Therefore, I deem all this to be a statement of facts as they are in reality, and not merely an exaggeration - all this which You tell me of Your sovereign glory and infinite auspicious attributes which are unie, unbounded, unsurpassed and natural. Therefore, O Lord, O Treasure of unsurpassed knowledge, power, strength, sovereignty, valour and radiance! - neither the gods nor the demons who possess limited knowledge know 'Your manifestation', the way in which You manifest Yourself.
10.14 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
10.14 O Kesava, manye, I accept; to be rtam, true indeed; sarvam, all; etat, this that has been said by sages and You; yat, which; vadasi, You tell, speak; mam, to Me. Hi, certainly; bhagavan, O Lord; na devah, neither the gods; na danavah, nor the demons; viduh, comprehend; te, Your; vyaktim, glory [Prabhavam in the Commentary is the same as prabhavam, glory, the unalified State.].
Since You are the origin of the gods and others, therefore,
10.16 Thou shouldst indeed tell, without reserve, of Thy divine glories by which Thou existest, pervading all these worlds. (None else can do so.)
10.16 Please tell me all about Thy glorious manifestations, by means of which Thou pervadest the world.
10.16. You are [alone] capable of fully declaring the auspicious manifesting powers of  Yours, by which manifesting power You remain pervading these worlds.
10.16 You should tell Me without reserve Your divine manifestations whery You abide pervading all these worlds.
10.16 Be pleased to speak in full of Your own manifestations which are indeed divine, through which manifestations You exist pervading these worlds.
10.16 Whatever manifestations there be that are divine, unie to Yourself - You alone are capable of describing them without exception. 'You reveal them Yourself' is the meaning. With these innumerable Vibhutis, these instances of your manifestation indicating Your will to rule, You abide, pervading all these worlds as their controller.

What is the need for such description?  The answer follows:
10.16 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
10.16 Arhasi, be pleased; vaktum, to speak; asesena, in full; atmavibhutayah, of Your own manifestations; divyah hi, which are indeed divine; yabhih, through which; vibhutibhih, manifestations, manifestations of Your glory; tisthasi, You exist; vyapya, pervading; iman, these; lokan, worlds.
10.17 How shall I, ever meditating, know Thee, O Yogin? In what aspects or things, O blessed 
Lord, art Thou to be thought of by me?
10.17 O Master! How shall I, by constant meditation, know Thee? My Lord! What are Thy various manifestations through which I am to mediate on Thee?
10.17. O Mighty Yogin !  How should I know You, meditating on You ?  In what several entities,  O Bhagavat, are You to be contemplated upon by me ?
10.17 How can I, Your devotee, know You by constantly meditating on You?  And in what modes, O Lord, are you to be meditated upon by Me.
10.17 O Yogi, [Here yoga stands for the results of yoga, viz omniscience, omnipotence, etc.; one possessed of these is a yogi. (See Comm. on 10.7)] how shall I know You by remaining ever-engaged in meditation? And through what objects, O Lord, are You to be meditated on by me?
10.17 I, 'Your devotee' (Yogin), namely, one engaged in Bhakti Yoga, and 'constantly meditating on You' with devotion, namely, embarked on meditation on You, - how am I to know You, the object of meditation, as possessing a multitude of auspicious attributes like sovereignty etc.?  And in what varied modes of mental dispositions, which are as yet untold and which are different from the intelligence, knowledge etc., described earlier, are You the Controller of all, to be meditated upon by me.
10.17 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
10.17 O Yogi, katham, how; aham vidyam, shall I know tvam, You; sada pari-cintayan, by remaining ever-engaged in meditation? Ca, and; kesu kesu bhavesu, through what objects; bhagvan, O Lord; cintah asi, are You to be meditated on; maya, by me?
10.18 Tell me again in detail, O Krishna, of Thy Yogic power and glory; for I am not satiated with what I have heard of Thy life-giving and nectar-like speech.
10.18 Tell me again, I pray, about the fullness of Thy power and Thy glory; for I feel that I am never satisfied when I listen to Thy immortal words.
10.18. In detail,  please expound, once again Your own Yogic power and the manifesting power. O Janardana !  I don't  feel contended in hearing Your nectar-[like exposition].
10.18 Speak to me again in full, O Krsna, about Your attributes and glories. For I am not satiated by hearing Your ambrosial words.
10.18 O Janardana, narrate to me again [In addition to what has been said in the seventh and ninth chapters.] Your onw yoga and (divine) manifestations elaborately. For, while hearing (Your) nectar-like (words), there is no satiety in me.
10.18 Speak to me again in full, your association with the alities of being the creator etc., and Your sovereignty, Your rulership, which have been briefly described in 'I am the origin of all; from Me proceed everything' (10.8). For I am not satiated by hearing Your ambrosial words. The meaning is, 'My enthusiasm to know more and more of your ambrosial teachings is known to You.'
10.18 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
10.18 O Janardana: ardana is derived from ard, in the sense of the act of going; by virtue of making the janas, the demons who are opposed to the gods, go to hell etc. He is called Jana-ardana. Or, He is called so because He is prayed to [The verbal root ard has got a second meaning, 'to pray'.] by all beings for the sake of human goals, viz prosperity and Liberation.
Kathaya, narrate to me; bhuyah, again, though spoken of earlier; atmanah, Your own; yogam, yoga-the special ability in the form of mystic powers; and vibhutaim, the (divine) manifestations-the variety of the objects of meditation; vistarena, elaborately. Hi, for; srnvatah, while hearing; (Your) amrtam, nectar-like speech issuing out of Your mouth; na asti, there is no; trptih, satiety; me, in me.
10.19 The Blessed Lord said  Very well! Now I will declare to thee My divine glories in their prominence, O Arjuna; there is no end to their detailed description.
10.19 Lord Shri Krishna replied: So be it, My beloved fried! I will unfold to thee some of the chief aspects of My glory. Of its full extent there is no end.
10.19. The Bhagavat said  Yes. O the best among the Kurus !  I shall expound to you, only the chief auspicious manifesting powers of Mine.  For, there would be no end to My details.
10.19 The Lord said  Indeed I shall tell you, O Arjuna, My auspicious manifestations (Vibhutis) - those that are prominent among these. There is no end to their extent.
10.19 The Blessed Lord said  O best of the Kurus, now, according to their importance, I shall described to you My onw glories, which are indeed divine. There is no end to my manifestations.
10.19 The Lord said  O Arjuna, I shall tell you My auspicious manifestations - those that are prominent among these. The term 'Pradhanya' connotes pre-eminence. For it will be said, 'Know Me to be the chief among family priests' (10.24). I shall declare to you those that are prominent in the world. For it would not be possible to tell or listen to them in detail, because there is no limit to them. To be a Vibhuti, the manifestation referred to should be under the control of the Lord; because it is stated:  'He who in truth knows this supernal manifestation and the seat of auspicious attributes' (10.7), after listing the various kinds of mental dispositions like intelligence etc., of all beings. Similarly it has been stated there that 'being the creator etc.,' is meant by the term Yoga, and that their 'being actuated,' meant by the term Vibhuti. Again it is stated:  'I am the origin of all; from me proceed everything; thinking thus, the wise worship Me with all devotion' (10.8).

Sri Krsna clearly declares that he rules over all creatures by actuating them from within as their Self. He also declares His being the creator, sustainer and destroyer of everything, as connected by the term Yoga.

10.19 Kuru-srestha, O best of the Kurus; hanta, now; since, on the other hand, it is not possible to speak exhaustively of them even in a hundred years, (there-fore) pradhanyatah, according to their importance, according as those manifestations are pre-eminent in their respective spheres; kathayisyami, I shall described; te, to you; atma-vibhutayah, My own glories; which are (hi, indeed) divyah, divine, heavenly. Na asti there is no; antah, end; me, to My; vistarasya, manifestations.
'Of those, now listen to the foremost:'
10.2 Neither the hosts of the gods nor the great sages know My origin; for in every way I am the source of all the gods and the great sages.
10.2 Neither the professors of divinity nor the great ascetics know My origin, for I am the source of them all.
10.2. Neither the hosts of gods, nor the great seers know My origin.  For, I am the first, in every respect, among the gods and great seers.
10.2 Neither the host of the gods nor the great seers know My power. Indeed, I am the only source of the gods and of the great seers.
10.2 Neither the gods nor the great sages know My majesty. For, in all respects, I am the source of the gods and the great sages.
10.2 However supernatural the vision and however great the knowledge of the host of the gods and the wise seers may be, they cannot comprehend My powers. They do not know My name, actions, essence, attributes etc., for the reason that I am the source in every way of these gods and great seers. I am the source of their nature and knowledge, power etc. The knowledge given to them by Me according to their meritorious deeds constitutes the cause of their being gods, the great seers etc. That knowledge is limited. Thus, they have limited knowledge and do not know the real nature of My essence.

Sri Krsna proceeds to explain that knowledge about His real nature, which is beyond the grasp of gods etc., and which is the means for release from the evil that stands in the way of the rise of devotion.
10.2 See Comment under 10.5
10.2 Na sura-sanah, neither the gods-Brahma and others; viduh, know;-what do they not know?-me, My; prabhavam (prabhavam), majesty, abundance of lordly power-or, derived in the sense of 'coming into being', it means origin. Nor even the maharsayah, great sages, Bhrgu and others [Bhrgu, Marici, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and Vasistha.-Tr.] devanam, of the gods; ca, and; maharsinam, of the great sages.
Besides,
10.20 I am the Self, O Gudakesa, seated in the hearts of all beings; I am the beginning, the middle and also the end of all beings.
10.20 O Arjuna! I am the Self, seated in the hearts of all beings; I am the beginning and the life, and I am the end of them all.
10.20. O coneror of sleep !  I am the Soul residing in the heart of all beings;  I am the beginning, and the middle and also the very end of beings.
10.20 I am the Self, O Arjuna, dwelling in the hearts of all beings. I am the beginning, the middle and also the end of all beings.
10.20 O Gudakesa, I am the Self residing in the hearts of all beings, and I am the beginning and the middle as also the end of (all) beings.
10.20 I am the Self dwelling in the heart of all beings who constitute My body. What is called 'Self' is in every way the supporter, controller and the principal of a body. It is further declared:  'And I am seated in the hearts of all; from Me are memory, knowledge and their removal' (15.15), and 'The Lord dwells, O Arjuna in the heart of every being causing them to spin round and round by His power, as if set on a wheel' (18.61). The Srutis also declare:  'He who, dwelling in all beings, is within all beings, whom all beings do not know, whose body all beings are, who controls all beings from within, is your Inner Controller, immortal Self (Br. U., 3.7.15); and 'He who, dwelling in the self is within the self, whom the self does not know, whose body the self is, and who controls the self from within, He is your Inner Controller and Immortal Self' (Sata. Br., 14.5.30). Thus, I am the Self of all beings and I am their beginning, the middle and also the end. The meaning is that I am the cause of their origination, sustentation and dissolution.

Thus, having explained that the Lord's immanence in all beings, which are His manifestations having Him, as their Self, is the ground for naming them in the manner of Samanadhikaranya or co-ordinate predication with Him (i.e., predication that they are He Himself), Sri Krsna proceeds to present some specific or distinguished manifestations in the same style of co-ordinate predication. As the Lord abides as the Self in all, the final significance of all terms culminates in Him. Terms such as god, man, bird, tree etc., though they signify the respective physical forms of those objects, they culminate through them in the selves in them as their final significance. Just like that here it is going to be stated in the conclusion of the account of the manifestations of the Lord, that the Lord's immanence in them all as their Self is the basis for describing them in such co-ordinate predication (as He Himself). The text 'There is nothing, moving or unmoving, apart from Me' (10.39) says that they are inseparable from Him, and this inseparability is the result of their being under His control. This has been initially declared in the words 'All proceed from Me' (10.8).

[This word Samanadhikaranya is translated by some also as 'grammatical co-ordination.' It is a context in which a number of words, usually having varying denotations, are used to signify an identical object. This kind of co-ordinate relation occurs in all the following verses in which Sri Krsna eates Himself with various objects having different denotations as Atman, Visnu among the Adityas, Indra, Marici, Sankara, Kubera, etc. Further explanation is given in the commentary.]

And, by one who is unable to do so, I am to be meditated on through the following aspects. I am capable of being meditated on (through them) becasue aham, I; am verily the adih, beginning, the origin; and the madhyam, middle, continuance; ca, as also; the antah, end, dissolution; bhutanam, of (all) beings.

I am the moon who is the Lord of the constellations.

10.3 He who knows Me as unborn and beginningless, as the great Lord of the worlds, he, among mortals, is undeluded and he is liberated from all sins.
10.3 He who knows Me as the unborn, without beginning, the Lord of the universe, he, stripped of his delusion, becomes free from all conceivable sin.
10.3. Whosoever  knows Me as  the unborn and beginningless Absolute Lord of the universe,  that person, not deluded among the mortals,  is delivered from all sins.
10.3 He who knows Me as unborn and without a beginning and the great Lord of the worlds - he among the mortals is undeluded and is released from every sin.
10.3 He who knows Me-the birthless, the beginningless, and the great Lord of the worlds, he, the undeluded one among mortals, becomes freed from all sins.
10.3 He who exists 'without being born' at any particular time unlike other beings is 'unborn' in the sense of being eternal. For, this attribute denotes a unie state distinct in kind both from insentient things which are subject to modifications, and from the self in Its state of involvement in Samsara when It is united with insentient matter. In that state the birth of the self involved in matter is generated by Karma. The temr 'Anadi', or without beginning, is used to distinguish the state of the Lord, which is distinct in kind, from that of the liberated state which is birthless but can be said to have a beginning. For, to the liberated self, the state of liberation has a beginning, because, in regard to this, conjunction with matter which deserves to be abandoned, existed previously. Hence the term 'Anadi' implies that the Lord is without such conjunction and does not deserve the same description. The Sruti also says:  'Him who is stainless' (Sve. U., 4.19).

Thus, he who is undeluded among the mortals understands Me as 'the great Lord of the worlds,' as the Lord of the lords of the worlds. My nature is incompatible with association with evil which has to be given up. What is called 'delusion' is the wrong knowledge of taking Me as one among other entities of the same kind. To be bereft of this delusion is to be 'undeluded'. Such a person is released from all sins which stand against the rise of Bhakti to Me.

The meaning is this:  In this world, the king who rules over men is only like all those men. He has become a ruler by some good Karma. Such is not the case with the Lord of the gods (the Supreme Being). Even the lord of the cosmic egg (Brahma) is of the same class as other beings in Samsara, because he too is a created being coming within the threefold classification of beings according to the three innate tendencies for growth - namely Karma-bhavana, Brahma-bhavana and Ubhaya-bhavana. These three are described respectively as fitness to practise work alone, fitness to practise meditation alone and fitness to practise both together. Brahma comes under the third group. The Sruti also says, 'He who creates Brahma' (Sve. U., 6.18). The same is the case with all those who have acired the eight superhuman powers like becoming atomic etc. But I, the Supreme Being, is the great Lord of the worlds. He who is not subject to the delusion of regarding Me as of the same order as others, - such a person knows Me as distinct in kind from non-conscient matter in its states as cause and effect, from the self whether bound or free, and from everything else, on account of all of them being subject to My control. I am antagonistic to all that is evil and I am the sole centre of innumerable auspicious attributes, unsurpassed and incomparable. It is also My inherent nature to be the controller of everything. One who understands Me to be all this is released from every sin.

Thus, after showing the annihilation, by meditation on His nature, of all evil impeding the rise of Bhakti, and also of the rise of devotion, through implication, by the destruction of such opposing factors, Sri Krsna now explains the way in which Bhakti develops by meditation on His sovereign power and on the multitude of His auspicious attributes:

10.3 Yah, he who; vetti, knows; mam, Me; ajam, the birthless; and anadim, the beginningless: Since I am the source of the gods and the great sages, and nothing else exists as My origin, therefore I am birthless and beginningless. Being without an origin is the cause of being birthless. He who knows Me who am thus birthless and beginningless, and loka-maheswaram, the great Lord of the worlds, the transcendental One devoid of ignorance and its effects; sah, he; the asammudhah, undeluded one; martyesu, among mortals, among human beings; pramucyate, becomes freed; sarva-papaih, from all sins-committed knowingly or unknowingly.
'For the following reason also I am the great Lord of the worlds:'
10.30 And, I am Prahlada among the demons, among the reckoners I am time; among beasts I am the lion, and Vainateya (Garuda) among birds.
10.30 And I am the devotee Prahlad among the heathen; of Time I am the Eternal Present; I am the Lion among beasts and the Eagle among birds.
10.30. No such translation is available for this sloka.
10.30 Of Daityas, I am Prahlada. Of reckoners, I am Death. Of beasts, I am the lion, and of birds I am Garuda the son of Vinata.
10.30 Among demons I am Prahlada, and I am Time among reckoners of time. And among animals I am the loin, and among birds I am Garuda.
10.30 Of those who reckon with the desire to cause evil, I am the god of death - (here an emissary of his who records the time of death of creatures is meant).

10.31 Among the purifiers (or the speeders) I am the wind; Rama among the warriors am I; among the fishes I am the shark; among the streams I am the Ganga.
10.31 I am the Wind among purifiers, the King Rama among warriors; I am the Crocodile among the fishes, and I am the Ganges among rivers.
10.31. Of the progenies of Diti (the demons),  I am Prahlada; of the measuring ones, I am the shark; of rivers,  I am the daughter of Jahnu (the Ganga).
10.31 Of moving things, I am the wind. Of those who bear weapons, I am Rama. Of fishers, I am Makara, and of rivers, I am Ganga.
10.31 Of the purifiers I am air; among the wielders of weapons I am Rama. Among fishes, too, I am the shark; I am Ganga among rivers.
10.31 Of moving things, namely, of things whose nature is to move, I am the wind. Of those who bear weapons, I am Rama. Here the ality of bearing weapons is the Vibhuti, as no other sense is possible. Aditya etc., being individual selves, constitute attributes of the Lord, who is their Self as they constitute His body. Therefore they stand in the same position of the attribute as that of bearing weapons.

10.32 O Arjuna, of creations I am the beginning and the end as also the middle, I am the knowledge of the Self among knowledge; of those who date I am vada.
10.32 Those that undergo creation are 'creatures'. Their beginning is the cause. The meaning is that, of the creatures which are being created at all times, I am Myself the creator. Similarly, I am the end, namely the destroyer of everyone of those who are being destroyed at all times. Similarly I am the middle, namely, the sustentation. The meaning is, I am the sustainer of those who are being sustained at all times. Of those who indulge in Jalpa (argument) and Vitanda (perverse criticism) etc., I am the fair reasoning which determines the truth.

10.32 O Arjuna sarganam, of creations; I am the adih, beginning; ca, and ; he antah, end; ca eva, as also; the madhyam, middle-I am the origin, continuance and dissolution. At the commencement (verse 20) origin, end, etc. only of things possessed of souls were spoken of, but here the mention is of all creations in general. This is the difference. Vidyanam, among knowledges; I am the adhyatma-vidya, knowledge of the Self, it being the foremost because of its leading to liberation. Pravadatam, of those who date; aham, I; am vadah, Vada, which is preeminent since it is a means to determining true purport. Hence I am that . By the word pravadatam are here meant the different kinds of date held by dators, viz Vada, Jalpa, and Vitanda. [Vada: discussion with open-mindedness, with a veiw to determining true purport; jalpa: pointless date; Vitanda: wrangling discussion. [Jalpa is that mode of date by which both parties establish their own viewpoint through direct and indirect proofs, and refute the view of the opponent through circumvention (Chala) and false generalization (Jati) and by pointing out unfitness (of the opponent) tobe argued with (Nigraha-sthana). But where one party establishes his viewpoint, and the other refutes it through circumvention, false generalization and showing the unfitness of the opponent to be argued with, without establishing his own views, that is termed Vitanda. Jalpa and Vitanda result only in a trial of streangth between the opponents, who are both desirous of victory, But the result of Vada is the ascertainment of truth between the teacher and the disciple or between others, both unbiased.-Gloss of Sridhara Swami on this verse.]-Tr.]

10.33 Of letters I am the alphabet 'a', which is the base of all letters as established in the Sruti:  'The letter 'a' itself is all speech' (Ai. Ai., 3.2.3). Samasika means collection of compound words. In it, I am the Dvandva compound; it is eminent because the meanings of both constituent terms are important. I am Myself imperishable Time composed of (divisions like) Kala, Muhurta etc. I am the four-faced Hiranyagarbha who is the creator of all.

I am that. This is the meaning. Or, the supreme God is the all-destroyer because He destroys everything during dissolution. I am He. And I am udbhavah, prosperity, eminence, and the means to it. Of whom? Bhavisyatam, of those destined to be prosperous, i.e. of those who are fit for attaining eminence.

10.39 Of all beings, in whatever condition they may exist, whether manifest or not, I alone am that state. Whatever host of beings are said to exist, they do not exist without Me as their Self. In the statement, 'Nothing that moves or does not move exists without Me', it is taught that the Lord exists as the Self, as said in the beginning:  'I am the Self, seated in the hearts of all beings' (10.20). The purport is that the entire host of beings in every state, is united with Me, their Self. By this He makes it clear that He, being the Self of all things, is the ground for His being denoted by everything in co-ordinate predication.

Ca, moreover; O Arjuna, yat api, whatsoever; is the bijam, seed, the source of 
growth ; sarva-bhutanam, of all beings; tat, that I am. As a conclusion of the topic the Lord states in brief His divine manifestations: Na tat asti bhutam, there is no thing; cara-acaram, moving or non-moving; yat, which; syat, can exist; vina maya, without Me. For whatever is rejected by Me, from whatever I withdraw Myself will have no substance, and will become a non-entity. Hence the meaning is that everything has Me as its essence.

'Eability' is to become eable in mind whether good or bad befalls and to look upon with the same eanimity on what happens to oneself, friends and enemies. 'Cheerfulness' is the natural disposition to feel pleased with everything seen. 'Austerity' is the chastising of the body by denying to oneself pleasures, as enjoined by the scriptures. 'Beneficence' is giving to another what contributes to one's own enjoyment. 'Fame' is the renown of possessing good alities. 'Infamy' is notoriety of possessing bad alities. The workings of the mind which are in accordance with fame and infamy must be understood here, because it is the subject-matter of the context. Austerity and beneficence are to be understood in the same way. All these mental faculties - these functioning of the mind - resulting either in activity or inactivity, are from Me alone, i.e., are dependent on My volition.

Sri Krsna declares:  'Thos agents who direct the creation, sustentation etc., of all beings, have their activity dependent on My Will.'

10.40 There is no end to My divine gloreis, O Arjuna, but this is a brief statement by Me of the particulars of My divine glories.
10.40 O Arjuna! The aspects of My divine life are endless. I have mentioned but a few by way of illustration.
10.40. O scorcher of  foes !  There is no end to My extraordinary manifesting Power.  The above details of [My] manifesting power have been declared by Me only by way of examples.
10.40 There is no limit to My divine mannifestations. Here the extent of such manifestations has been made in brief by Me.
10.40 O destroyer of enemies, there is no limit to My divine manifestations. This description of (My) manifestations, however, has been stated by Me by way illustration.
10.40 There is no limit to the divine and auspicious manifestations of My will to rule. But it has been described to some extent by Me in brief by means of a few illustrations.
10.40 See Comment under 10.42
10.40 Parantapa, O destroyer of enemies; asti, there is; na, no; antah, limit; to mama, My; divyanam, divine; vibhutinam, manifestations. Indeed, it is not possible for anyone to speak or know of the limit of the divine manifestations of the of the all-pervading God. Esah, this; vistarah, description; vibhuteh, of (My) manifestations; tu, however; prokatah, has been stated; maya, by Me; uddesatah, by way of illustration, partially.
10.41 Whatever being there is glorious, prosperous or powerful, that know thou to be a manifestation of a part of My splendour.
10.41 Whatever is glorious, excellent, beautiful and mighty, be assured that it comes from a fragment of My splendour.
10.41. Whatsoever being exists with the manifesting power, and with beauty and vigour, be sure that it is born only of a bit of My illuminant.
10.41 Whatever being is possessed of power, or of splendour, or of energy, know that as coming from a fragment of My power.
10.41 Whatever object [All living beings] is verily endowed with majesty, possessed of prosperity, or is energetic, you know for certain each of them as having a part of My power as its source.
10.41 Whatever host of beings has 'power', namely the capacity and means to rule over; has 'splendour', has beauty or prosperity in wealth, grains etc., has 'energy,' namely, is engaged in auspicious undertakings - know such manifestations as coming fro a fragment of My 'power'. Power (Tejas) is the capacity to overcome opposition. The meaning is, know them as arising from a fraction of My inconceivable power of subduing.
10.41 See Comment under 10.42
10.41 Yat yat, whatever; sattvam, object in the world; is eva, verily; vibhutimat, endowed with majesty; srimad, possessed of prosperity; va, or; is urjitam, energetic, possessed of vigour; tvam, you; avagaccha, know; eva, for certain; tat tat, each of them; as mama tejomsa-sambhavam, having a part (amsa) of My (mama), of God's, power (teja) as its source (sambhavam).
10.42 But, of what avail to thee is the knowledge of all these details, O Arjuna? I exist, supporting this whole world by one part of Myself.
10.42 But what is the use of all these details to thee? O Arjuna! I sustain this universe with only small part of Myself."
10.42. Or, O Arjuna !  Why this detailed statement ?  I remain, pervading this entire universe with a single fraction [of Myself].
10.42 But of what use to you is all this extensive knowledge O Arjuna?  I stand sustaining this whole universe with a fragment of Mine (of My power).
10.42 Or, on the other hand, what is the need of your knowing this extensively, O Arjuna? I remain sustaning this whole creation in a special way with a part (of Myself).
10.42 What is the use to you of this detailed knowledge taught by Me?  I sustain this universe with an infinitesimal fraction of My power - this universe consisting of sentient and non-sentient entities, whether in effect or causal condition, whether gross or subtle - in such a manner that it does not violate My will in preserving its proper form, existence and various activities. As said by Bhagavan Parasara:  'On an infinitesimal fraction of this energy, this universe rests' (V. P., 1.9.53).
10.19-42 Hanta te etc. upto jagat sthitah.  I am the Soul etc.  (verse 20) :  By this [the Bhagavat]  wards off the exclusion  [of any being as different form Him].  Otherwise the sentences like  'Of the immovable  [I am]  the the Himalayas' (verse 25) etc., would amount to the exclusive statement that the Himalayan range is the Bhagavat and not any other one.  In that case, the indiscriminateness of the Brahman is not established and hence the realisation of the Brahman would be a partial (or conditioned) one.  For, the [present] text of exposition is intended for that seeker whose mind cannot contemplate on the all-pervasiveness [of the Brahman], but who [at the same time] is desirous of realising that [all-pervasiveness].  Hence, while concluding, [the Bhagavat] teaches the theory of duality-cumunity by saying  'whatsoever being exists with the manifesting  power' etc., and  then concludes the topic with the theory of absolute unity, as 'Or what is the use of this elaboration;৷৷৷৷.I remain pervading this [universe] by a single fraction [of Myself]  This has been declared indeed [in the scriptures] as : 
 
'All beings constitute [only] His one-fourth;  His [other] immortal three-forths are in the heaven.'  (Rgveda,  X, xc, 3).
 
Thus, all this and the prime cause of creatures, are nothing but the Bhagavat (Absolute).  And hence, He Himself becomes the object of knowledge of all, but being comprehended with the different strange alities.
10.42 Athava, or, on the other hand; kim, what is the need; of tava jnatena, your knowing; etena bahuna, this extensively-but imcompletely-in the above manner, O Arjuna? You listen to this subject that is going to be stated in its fullness: Aham, I; sthitah, remain; vistabhya, sustaining, supporting, holding firmly, in a special way; idam, this; krtsnam, whole; jagat, creation; ekamsena, by a part, by a foot [The Universe is called a foot of His by virtue of His having the limiting adjunct of being its efficient and material cause.] (of Myself), i.e. as the Self of all things [As the material and the efficient cause of all things]. The Vedic text, 'All beings form a foot of His' (Rg., Pu. Su. 10.90.3; Tai. Ar. 3.12.3) support this. [A Form constituted by the whole of creation has been presented in this chapter for meditation. Thery the unalified transcendental Reality, implied by the word tat (in tattva-masi) and referred to by the latter portion of the Commentator's otation (viz tripadasyamrtam divi: The immortal three-footed One is established in His own effulgence), becomes established.]
10.5 Non-injury, eanimity, contentment, austerity, beneficence, fame, ill-fame  (these) different kinds of alities of beings arise from Me alone.
10.5 Harmlessness, equanimity, contentment, austerity, beneficence, fame and failure, all these, the characteristics of beings, spring from Me only.
10.5. [Also]  non-injury, eanimity, contentment, austerity, charity, repute and ill-repute - all these diverse dispositions of beings emanate from none but Me.
10.5 Non-violence, eality, cheerfulness, austerity, beneficence, fame and infamy- these different alities of beings arise from Me alone.
10.5 Non-injury, eanimity, satisfaction, austerity, charity, fame, infamy-(these) different dispositions of beings spring from Me alone.
10.4 - 10.5 'Intelligence' is the power of the mind to determine. 'Knowledge' is the power of determining the difference between the two entities - non-sentient matter and the individual self. 'Non-delusion' is freedom from the delusion of perceiving as silver the mother-of-pearl etc., which are different from silver etc., previously observed. 'Forbearance', is a non-disturbed state of mind, even when there is a cause for getting disturbed. 'Truth' is speech about things as they are actually seen, and meant for the good of all beings. Here, the working of the mind in conformity with the ideal is intended, because the context is with reference to the working of the mind. 'Restraint' is the checking of the outgoing organs from their tendency to move towards their objects and generate evil. 'Self-control' is the restraint of the mind in the same manner. 'Pleasure' is the experience of what is agreeable to oneself. 'Pain' is th experience of what is adverse. 'Exaltation' is that state of elation of the mind caused by experiences which are agreeable to oneself. 'Depression' is the state of mind caused by disagreeable experiences. 'Fear' is the misery which springs from the perception of the cause of future sufferings. 'Fearlessness' is the absence of such feelings. 'Non-violence' is avoidance of being the cause of sorrow to others. 'Eability' is to become eable in mind whether good or bad befalls and to look upon with the same eanimity on what happens to oneself, friends and enemies. 'Cheerfulness' is the natural disposition to feel pleased with everything seen. 'Austerity' is the chastising of the body by denying to oneself pleasures, as enjoined by the scriptures. 'Beneficence' is giving to another what contributes to one's own enjoyment. 'Fame' is the renown of possessing good alities. 'Infamy' is notoriety of possessing bad alities. The workings of the mind which are in accordance with fame and infamy must be understood here, because it is the subject-matter of the context. Austerity and beneficence are to be understood in the same way. All these mental faculties - these functioning of the mind - resulting either in activity or inactivity, are from Me alone, i.e., are dependent on My volition.

Sri Krsna declares:  'Thos agents who direct the creation, sustentation etc., of all beings, have their activity dependent on My Will.'
10.1-5 The subject-matter that has been indicated in the previous nine chapters - the same in being detailed here in this chapter by citing individual instances.  That is why  [the Bhagavat]  says  'Yet again etc.'  (10.X, 1).  He thus indicates  'Hear the subject matter, which has  already been related to you, but which once again being explained in order to make it clear'.  Arjuna too says in the seel  likewise  'Tell me once again etc.'  (10.X, 18).  This is the purport of  [this] chapter.  Other items are clear by mere reciting.  Hence, why to repeat them ?  However,  whatever is doubtful that  shall be decided  [then and there].
 
Bhuyah etc.  upto  prthagvidhah.  Steadiness is that which induces one.
10.5 Buddhih, intelligence-the power of the internal organ to know of things which are subtle etc. Indeed, people talk of a man possessed of this (power) as intelligent. Jnanam, wisdom-knowledge of entities such as the Self etc. Asammohah, non-delusion-proceeding with discrimination with regard to things that are to be known as they present them-selves. Ksama, forgiveness-unperturbability of the mind of one who is abused or assulted. Satyam, truth-an utterance regarding what one has seen, heard, and felt oneself, communicated as such to others for their understanding, is said to be truth. Damah, control of the external organs. Samah, control of the internal organs. Sukham, happiness. Duhkham, sorrow. Bhavah, birth; and its opposite abhavah, death. And bhayam, fear; as also its opposite abhayam, fearlessness. Ahimsa, non-injury-non-cruely towards creatures. Samata, eanimity. Tustih, satisfaction-the idea of sufficiency with regard to things acired. Tapah, austerity-disciplining the body through control of the organs. Danam, charity-distribution (of wealth) according to one's capacity. Yasah, fame-renown arising from righteousness. On the contrary, ayasah is infamy due to unrighteousness. (These) prthak-vidhah, different; bhavah, dispositions-intelligence etc. as described; bhuanam, of beings, of living bengs. bhavanti, spring; mattah, eva, from Me alone, [This is said in the sesne that none of these dispositions can exist without the Self.] from God, in accordanced with their actions.
Moreover,
10.6 The seven great sages, the ancient four and also the Manus, possessed of powers like Me (on account of their minds being fixed on Me), were born of (My) mind; from them are these creatures born in this world.
10.6 The seven Great Seers,* the Progenitors of mankind, the Ancient Four,** and the Lawgivers were born of My Will and come forth direct from Me. The race of mankind has sprung from them. [* Mareechi, Atri, Angira, Pulah, Kratu, Pulastya, Vahishta. ** The Masters: Sanak, Sanandan, Sanatan, Sanatkumar.]
10.6. The ancient Seven Great-Seers and also the Four Manus, of whom these creatures in this world are offsprings-they have been born as My mental dispositions.
10.6 The seven great seers of yore and similarly the four Manus, all possessing My mental disposition, were born of My mind. All these creatures of the world are descended from them.
10.6 The seven great sages as also the four Manus of anceint days, of whom are these creatures in the world, had their thoughts fixed on Me, and they were born from My mind.
10.6 'The seven great Rsis of yore', namely, those seven great Rsis like Bhrgu etc., were from the mind of Brahma in the cycle of the past Manu to perpetuate the creation permanently; and the four Manas called the sons of Savarna existed for the work of eternal sustentation. All creatures in the world are their progeny. So they are the generators of this progeny as also their sustainers till the time of Pralaya. These Bhrgu etc., and the Manus, derive their mental condition from Me. Their disposition is My disposition - they subsist on My disposition. The meaning is they follow My will.
10.6 See Comment under 10.11
10.6 Sapta, the seven; maharsayah, great sages-Bhrgu and others; tatha, as also; catvarah, the four; manavah, Manus [Savarni, Dharma-savarini, Daksa-savarni, and Savarna.-Tr.]- well known as Savarnas; purve, of ancient days; yesam, of whom, of which Manus and the great sages; imah, these; prajah, creatures, moving and non-moving; loke in the world, are the creation; madbhavah, had their thoughts fixed on Me-they had their minds fixed on Me, (and hence) they were endowed with the power of Visnu; and they jatah, were born; manasa; from My mind-they were created by Me through My mind itself.
10.7 He who in truth knows these manifold manifestations of My Being and (this) Yoga-power of Mine becomes established in the unshakable Yoga; there is no doubt about it.
10.7 He who rightly understands My manifested glory and My Creative Power, beyond doubt attains perfect peace.
10.7. He, who knows correctly this extensively manifesting power and the Yogic power of Mine-he is endowed with the unwavering Yoga.  There is no doubt about it.
10.7 He who in truth knows this supernal manifestation and splendour of auspicious attributes of Mine, becomes, united with the unshakable Yoga of Bhakti. Of this, there is no doubt.
10.7 One who knows truly this majesty and yoga of Mine, he becomes imbued with unwavering Yoga. There is no doubt about this.
10.7 'Supernal manifestation' is the glory (Vibhuti) of the Lord. He who in truth knows this supernal manifestation that all origination, sustentation and activity depend on Me, and also that Yoga of Mine which is in the form of auspicious attributes antagonistic to all that is evil - such a person becomes united with the Yoga or Bhakti of an unshakable nature. Of  this, there is no doubt. The meaning is:  You yourself will see that the knowledge concerning the supernal manifestation and auspicious attributes of Mine will increase devotion.

Sri Krsna now shows that the growth of devotion  is of the form of the development of knowledge of His supreme state.
10.7 See Comment under 10.11
10.7 Yah, one who; vetti, knows; tattvatah, truly, i.e. just as it is; etam, this, aforesaid; vibhutim. majesty, (divine) manifestations; [Omnipresence.] and yogam, yoga, action, My own ability to achieve [God's omnipotence. (God's power of accomplishing the impossible.-M.S.)]-or, the capacity for mystic powers, the omniscience resulting from yoga (meditation), is called yoga; sah, he; yujyate, becomes imbued with; avikampena, unwavering; yogena, Yoga, consisting in steadfastness in perfect knowledge. [After realizing the personal God, he attains the transcendental Reality; the earlier knowledge leads to the latter.] There is no samsayah, doubt; atra, about this.
With what kind of unwavering Yoga does he become endued? This is being answered:
10.8 I am the source of all; from Me everything evolves; understanding thus, the wise, endowed with meditation, worship Me.
10.8 I am the source of all; from Me everything flows. Therefore the wise worship Me with unchanging devotion.
10.8. 'He is the source of all and from Him all comes forth' - Thus viewing, the wise men revere Me with devotion.
10.8 I am the origin of all; from Me proceed everything thinking thus the wise worship Me with all devotion (Bhava).
10.8 I am the origin of all; everything moves on owing to Me. Realizing thus, the wise ones, filled with fervour, adore Me.
10.8 I am the 'origin', namely, the cause of originating everything in this universe consisting of wonderful sentient and non-sentient beings. From Me proceed everything. Thinking thus of My sovereignty, natural and unhindered, and knowing Me as endowed with a multitude of auspicious attributes like condescension, beauty, parental affection etc., the wise or the men of knowledge worship Me with devotion endowed as I am with all auspicious attributes. 'Bhava' is a particular disposition, here a loving disposition, of the mind. The meaning is that they worship Me with intense yearning of the heart.

How?
10.8 See Comment under 10.11
10.8 Aham, I, the supreme Brahman called Vasudeva; am the prabhavah, origin; sarvasya, of all, of the whole world; sarvam, everything, the whole world of changes, consisting of continuance, destruction, action and enjoyment of the fruits of action; pravartate, moves on; mattah, owing to Me alone. Matva, realizing; iti, thus; the budhah, wise ones, the knowers of the supreme Reality; bhava-samanvitah, filled with fervour-bhava is the same as bhavana, meaning ardent longing for the supreme Reality; filled (samanvitah) with that, i.e. imbued with that; bhajante, adore; mam, Me.
Besides,
10.9 With their mind and their life wholly absorbed in Me, enlightening each other and ever speaking of Me, they are satisfied and delighted.
10.9 With minds concentrated on Me, with lives absorbed in Me, and enlightening each other, they ever feel content and happy.
10.9. Having their mind fixed on Me, their life gone into Me, enlightening each other, and constantly talking of Me, they are pleased and are delighted.
10.9 With their minds focussed on Me, with their Pranas centred in Me, inspiring one another and always speaking of Me, they live in contentment and bliss at all times.
10.9 With minds fixed on Me, with lives dedicated to Me, enlightening each other, and always speaking of Me, they derive satisfaction and rejoice.
10.9 They live with their minds 'focussed' on Me, namely, with their minds fixed on Me; with their 'Pranas', i.e., life, centred on Me - the meaning is that they are unable to sustain themselves without Me. They 'inspire one another' by speaking about My attributes which have been experienced by them and narrating My divine and adorable deeds. They live in contentment and bliss at all times. The speakers are delighted by their own speech, because it is spontaneous, without any ulterior motive; the listeners too feel the speech to be unsurpassingly and incomparably dear to them. They thus live in bliss.
10.9 See Comment under 10.11
10.9 Maccittah, with minds fixed on Me; mad-gata-pranah, with lives (pranas) dedicated to Me, or having their organs, eyes etc. absorbed in Me, i.e. having their organs withdrawn into Me; bodhayantah, enlightening; parasparam, each other; and nityam, always; kathayantah, speaking of; mam, Me, as possessed of alities like knowledge, strength, valour, etc; tusyanti, they derive satisfaction; and ramanti, rejoice, get happiness, as by coming in contact with a dear one.
11.1 Arjuna said  By this word (explanation) of the highest secret concerning the Self which Thou hast spoken, for the sake of blessing me, my delusion is gone.
11.1 "Arjuna said: My Lord! Thy words concerning the Supreme Secret of Self, given for my blessing, have dispelled the illusions which surrounded me.
11.1. Arjuna said  My delusion has completely gone thanks to the great and mysterious discourse which is termed as a science governing the Soul and which You have delivered by way of favouring me.
11.1 Arjuna said  To show favour to Me, You have told me that most profound mystery concerning the self; by that, this delusion of mine is dispelled.
11.1 Arjuna said  This delusion of mine has departed as a result of that speech which is most secret and known as pertaining to the Self, and which was uttered by You for my benefit.
11.1 Arjuna said  To show favour to me, who is deluded by the misconception that the body is the self, these words of supreme mystery concerned with the self, i.e., which is a proper description of the self, have been spoken by You in words beginning from 'There was never a time when I did not exist' (2.12) and ending with, 'Therefore, O Arjuna, become a Yogin' (6.46). By that this delusion of mine about the self is entirely removed.
11.1 Now  Arjuna seeks to perceive, with his own sense-organ (11.eye), what has been taught in the last chapter.  The subject matter,  learnt through the  [teacher's]  instructions, becomes ite clear if it is  grasped by the knowledge of perception.  For that end only the following conversation  is made -
11.1 Ayam, this; mahah, delusion; mama, of mine; vigatah, has departed, i.e., my non-discriminating idea has been removed; tena, as a result of that; vacah, speech of Yours; which is paramam, most, supremely; guhyam, secret; and adhyatma-sanjnitam, known as pertaining to the Self-dealing with discrimination between the Self and the non-Self; and yat, which; was uktam, uttered; tvaya, by You; madanugrahaya, for my benefit, out of favour for me.
Further,
11.10 With numerous mouths and eyes, with numerous wonderful sights, with numerous divine ornaments, with numerous divine weapons uplifted (such a form He showed).
11.10 There were countless eyes and mouths, and mystic forms innumerable, with shining ornaments and flaming celestial weapons.
11.10. That has many mouths and eyes, many wondrous sights, many heavenly ornaments, and many heavenly weapons held ready;
11.10 With innumerable mouths and eyes, many marvellous aspects, many divine    ornaments and many divine weapons.
11.10 Having many faces and eyes, possessing many wonderful sights, adorned with numerous celestial ornaments, holding many uplifted heavenly weapons;
11.10 - 11.11 'Divyam' means resplendent. 'Anantam' (boundless) means that form is not limited by time and space because of its being the foundation of the entire universe in the past, present and future. 'Visvatomukham' means facing in all directions. This form is adorned with divine raiments, perfumes, garlands, ornaments and weapons appropriate to it.

He explains the same resplendence expressed by the term 'Divyam':
11.10 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.10 A form aneka-vaktra-nayanam, having many faces and eyes; aneka-adbhuta-darsanam, possessing many wonderful sights; as also aneka-divya-abharanam, adorned with numerous celestial ornaments; and divya-aneka-udyata-ayudham, holding many uplifted heavenly weapons. This whole portion is connected with the verb '(He) showed' in the earlier verse.
 
Moreover,
11.11 Wearing divine garlands (necklaces) and apparel, anointed with divine unguents, the all-wonderful, resplendent (Being) endless with faces on all sides.
11.11 Crowned with heavenly garlands, clothed in shining garments, anointed with divine unctions, He showed Himself as the Resplendent One, Marvellous, Boundless, Omnipresent.
11.11. That wears heavenly garlands and garments; has the unguent of heavenly sandal paste;  it is all wonderful, shining (or godly), infinite; and it has faces in all directions.
11.11 Wearing celestial garlands and raiments, anointed with divine perfumes, full of all wonders, resplendent, boundless and facing all directions.
11.11 Wearing heavenly garlands and apparel, anointed with heavenly scents, abounding in all kinds of wonder, resplendent, infinite, and with faces everywhere.
11.10 - 11.11 'Divyam' means resplendent. 'Anantam' (boundless) means that form is not limited by time and space because of its being the foundation of the entire universe in the past, present and future. 'Visvatomukham' means facing in all directions. This form is adorned with divine raiments, perfumes, garlands, ornaments and weapons appropriate to it.

He explains the same resplendence expressed by the term 'Divyam':
11.11 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.11 Divya-malya-ambara-dharam, wearing heavenly garlands and apparel-the God wearing celestial flowers and clothings; divya-gandha-anulepanam, anointed with heavenly scents; sarva-ascaryamayam, abounding in all kinds of wonder; devam, resplendent; anantam, infinite, boundless; and visvato-mukham, with faces everywhere-He being the Self of all beings. 'He showed (to Arjuna)', or 'Arjuna saw', is to be supplied.
An illustration is once more being given of the effulgence of the Cosmic form of the Lord:
11.12 If the splendour of a thousand suns were to blaze out at once (simultaneously) in the sky, that would be the splendour of that mighty Being (great Soul).
11.12 Could a thousand suns blaze forth together it would be but a faint reflection of the radiance of the Lord God.
11.12. If  the splendour of a thousand suns were to  burst forth at once in the sky, would that be eal to the splendour of that Mighty Self ?
11.12 If a thousand suns were to rise at once in the sky, the resulting splendour may be like the splendour of that mighty One.
11.12 Should the effulgence of a thousand suns blaze forth simultaneously in the sky, that might be similar to the radiance of that exalted One.
11.12 This is for illustrating that His splendour is infinite. The meaning is that it is of the nature of inexhaustible radiance.
11.12 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.12 Should the bhah, effulgence; surya-sahasrasya, of a thousand suns; utthita bhavet, blaze forth; yugapat, simultaneously; divi, in the sky, or in heaven which is the third as counted (from this earth);sa, that; yadi syat, might be-or it might not be-; sadrsi, similar; to the bhasah, radiance; tasya, of that; mahat-manah, exalted One, the Cosmic Person Himself. The idea is that the brillinace of the Cosmic Person surely excels even this!
Further,
11.13 There, in the body of the God of gods, Arjuna then saw the whole universe resting in one, with its many groups.
11.13 In that vision Arjuna saw the universe, with its manifold shapes, all embraced in One, its Supreme Lord.
11.13. At that time the son of Pandu beheld there in the body of the God-of-gods, the entire universe, united in one and [yet] divided into many groups.
11.13 There (in that form) Arjuna beheld the whole universe, with its manifold divisions gathered together in one single spot within the body of the God of gods.
11.13 At that time, Pandava saw there, in the body of the God of gods, the whole diversely differentiated Universe united in the one (Cosmic form).
11.13 'There', in that unie and divine body of the God of gods - infinite in length and breadth, with innumerable hands, stomachs, faces and eyes, of immeasurable splendour, eipped with innumerable divine weapons, adorned with innumerable divine ornaments appropriate to itself and with divine garlands and raiments, fragrant with celestial perfumes and full of wonders , there Arjuna beheld with the appropriate divine eyes granted by the grace of the Lord, the 'entire universe' consisting of Prakrti (material Nature) and the selves, all remaining in 'one single spot,' namely, at one single point. He beheld 'the whole universe' with all its sub-divisions, differentiated into varied and wonderful classes of experiencing beings like Brahma, gods, animals, men, immovables etc., and the places, objects and means of experiences such as earth, ether, Rasatala, Atala, Vitala, Sutala etc. He beheld thus the entire universe as depicted in such texts as those starting with 'I am the origin of all; from Me proceed everything' (10.8), 'Indeed I shall tell you, O Arjuna, My glorious self-manifestations' (10.9), 'I am the Self, O Arjuna, dwelling in the hearts of all beings' (10.20), and 'Of Adityas, I am Visnu' (10.21), and ending with 'Nothing that moves or does not move exists without Me' (10.39), and 'I remain, with a single fraction of Myself sustaining this whole universe' (10.42).
11.13 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.13 Tada, at that time; pandavah, Pandava, Arjuna; apasyat, saw; tatra, there, in that Cosmic form; sarire, in the body; devadevasya, of the God of gods, of Hari; krtsnam, the whole; jagat, Universe; anekadha, deversely; pravibhaktam, differentiated-into groups of gods, manes, human beings, and others; ekastham, united in the one (Consmic form).
11.14 Then, Arjuna, filled with wonder and with his hair standing on end, bowed down his head to the God and spoke with joined palms.
11.14 Thereupon Arjuna, dumb with awe, his hair on end, his head bowed, his hands clasped in salutation, addressed the Lord thus:
11.14. Then, possessed  by amazement and with his bodily hair thrilled, Dhananjaya (Arjuna) with his head bowed to the God and with folded palms spoke [to Him].
11.14 Then he, Arjuna, overcome with amazement, his hairs standing erect, bowed his head to the Lord, and with folded hands spoke.
11.14 Then, filled with wonder, with hairs standing on end, he, Dhananjaya, (Arjuna), bowing down with his head to the Lord, said with folded hands:
11.14 Then Arjuna became overcome with amazement on seeing the Lord, at a point of whose being this wonderful universe in its entirely stands supported, who enables all things to act, and who is the possesor of a host of auspicious attributes like omniscience. With his hairs standing erect, he bowed down like a stick, and with folded hands, he spoke thus:
11.14 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.14  
Tatah, then, having seen Him; sah, he, Dhananjaya; became vismaya-avistah, filled with wonder; and hrsta-roma, had his hairs standing on end. Becoming filled with humility, pranamya, bowing down, bowing down fully; [With abundant respect and devotion.] sirasa, with his head; devam, to the Lord, who had assumed the Cosmic form; abhasata, he said; krta-anjalih, with folded hands, with palms joined in salutation:
How? 'I am seeing the Cosmic form that has been revealed by You'-thus expressing his own experience,
11.15 Arjuna said  I see all the gods, O God, in Thy body, and (also) hosts of various classes of beings, Brahma, the Lord, seated on the lotus, all the sages and the celestial serpents.
11.15 Arjuna said: O almighty God! I see in Thee the powers of Nature, the various creatures of the world, the Progenitor on his lotus throne, the Sages and the shining angels.
11.15. Arjuna said  O God !  In Your body I behold all gods and also hosts of different kinds of beings-the Lord Brahma  seated on the lotus-seat; and all the seers and all the glowing serpents.
11.15 Arjuna said  I behold, O Lord, in Your body all the gods and all the diverse hosts of beings. Brahma, Siva (Isa) who is in Brahma, the seers and the lustrous snakes.
11.15 Arjuna said  O God, I see in Your body all the gods as also hosts of (various) classes of beings; Brahma the ruler, sitting on a lotus seat, and all the heavely sages and serpents.
11.15 Arjuna said  O Lord! I behold in Your body all gods and all classes of living beings as also Brahma, the four-faced ruler of the cosmic egg. So too Siva (Isa) who is seated in the lotus-seated Brahma, meaning that Siva abides by the directions of Brahma. So also all the seers of whom the divine seers are the foremost; and lustrous snakes like Vasuki, Taksaka etc.
11.15 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.15 Deva, O God; pasyami, I see, perceive; tava dehe, in Your body; sarvan, all; the devan, gods; tatha, as also; bhuta-visesa-sanghan, hosts of (various) classes of beings, groups of moving and non-moving living things having different shapes; and besides, brahmanam, Brahma, with four faces; isam, the Ruler of creatures; kamalasana-stham, sitting on a lotus seat, i.e. sitting on Mount Meru which forms the pericarp of the lotus that is the earth; and sarvan, all; the divyan, heavenly; rsin, sages-Vasistha and others; and (the heavenly) uragan, serpents-Vasuki and others.
11.16 I see Thee of boundless form on every side with many arms, stomachs, mouths and eyes: neither the end nor the middle nor also the beginning do I see, O Lord of the universe, O Cosmic Form.
11.16 I see Thee, infinite in form, with, as it were, faces, eyes and limbs everywhere; no beginning, no middle, no end; O Thou Lord of the Universe, Whose Form is universal!
11.16. I  behold You of many arms, bellies, mouths and eyes and of infinite forms on all sides;  of You, I find neither the end, nor the centre, nor the beginnng too, O Lord of the universe, O Universal-formed One !
11.16 With manifold arms, stomachs, mouths and eyes, I behold Your infinite form on all sides. I see no end, no middle nor the beginning too of You, O Lord of the universe, O You of Universal Form.
11.16 I see You as possessed of numerous arms, bellies, mouths and eyes; as having infinite forms all around. O Lord of the Universe, O Cosmic Person, I see not Your limit nor the middle, nor again the beginning!
11.16 I behold Your infinite form on all sides with many arms, stomachs, mouths and eyes. O Lord of the universe, namely, the controller of the universe, O Universal Form having the universe as Your body! As You are infinite, therefore, I see no end, no middle and no beginning for You.
11.16 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.16 Pasyami, I see; tvam, You; aneka-bahu-udara-vaktra-netram, as possessed of numerous arms, bellies, mouths and eyes; ananta-rupam, having infinite forms; sarvatah, all around. Visveswara, O Lord of the Universe; visva-rupa, O Cosmic Person; na pasyami, I see not; ['I do not see-because of Your all-pervasiveness.'] tava, Your; antam, end; na madhyam, nor the middle-what lies between two extremities; na punah, nor again; the adim, beginning-I see not the limit (end) nor the middle, nor again the beginning, of You who are God!
Furthermore,
11.17 I see Thee with the diadem, the club and the discus, a mass of radiance shining 
everywhere, very hard to look at, blazing all round like burning fire and the sun, and immeasurable.
11.17 I see thee with the crown, the sceptre and the discus; a blaze of splendour. Scarce can I gaze on thee, so radiant thou art, glowing like the blazing fire, brilliant as the sun, immeasurable.
11.17. I behold  You as having crowns, clubs and discs;  as a mass of radiance, shining on all sides, hard to look at and  on each side blazing like burning fire and the sun; and as an immeasurable one.
11.17 I behold You as a mass of light shining everywhere, with diadem, mace and discus,  hard to behold, blazing like a burning fire and the sun, and immeasurable.
11.17 I see You as wearing a diadem, wielding a mace, and holding a disc; a mass of brilliance glowing all around, difficult to look at from all sides, possessed of the radiance of the blazing fire and sun, and immeasurable.
11.17 I behold you a mass of light shining everywhere, hard to look at, blazing like a burning fire and the sun. You, who are identifiable with Your divine diadem, mace and discus, are indefinable and immeasurable.
11.17 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.17 Pasyami, I see; tvam, You; as kiritinam, wearing a diadem-kirita is a kind of decoration for the head; one having it is kiriti; gadinam, wielding a mace; and also cakrinam, holding a disc; tejorasim, a mass of brilliance; sarvatah diptimantam, glowing all around; durniriksyam, difficult to look at; samantat, from all sides, at every point; as though dipta-analarka-dyutim, possessed of the radiance (dyuti) of the blazing (dipta) fire (anala) and sun (arka); and aprameyam, immeasurable, i.e. beyond limitation.
'For this reason also, i.e., by seeing Your power of Yoga, I infer' that-
11.18 Thou art the Imperishable, the Supreme Being, worthy to be known. Thou art the great treasure-house of this universe; Thou art the imperishable protector of the eternal Dhrama; Thou art the Primal Person, I deem.
11.18 Imperishable art Thou, the Sole One worthy to be known, the priceless Treasure-house of the universe, the immortal Guardian of the Life Eternal, the Spirit Everlasting.
11.18. You are the imperishable, the Supreme Being to be known;  You are the ultimate place of  rest for this  universe; You are changeless and the guardian of the pious act of the Satvatas;  You are the everlasting Soul,  I believe.
11.18 You are the Imperishable, Supreme One to be realised. You are the Supreme Substratum of this universe. You are immutable, the guardian of the eternal law, I know You are the Supreme Person who is everlasting.
11.18 You are the Immutable, the supreme One to be known; You are the most perfect repository of this Universe. You are the Imperishable, the Protector of the ever-existing religion; You are the eternal Person. This is my belief.
11.18 You alone are the Supreme 'Imperishable Person' indicated as that which ought to be realised in such Upanisadic passages as:  'Two sciences are to be known' (Mun. U., 1.1.4). You alone are the 'Supreme Substratum' of the universe, i.e., supreme support of this universe. You are 'immutable', namely, not liable to mutation. Whatever might be your attributes and divine manifestations, You remain unchanged in Your form. You alone are the guardian of 'the eternal law' - You who protect the eternal Dharma of the Veda by incarnations like this. I know you are the everlasting Person. I know You are the eternal Person, described in such passages as, 'I know this great Purusa' (Tai. A., 3.12.7) and 'Person who is higher than the high' (Mun. U., 3.2.8). You, who were till now known to me as the most distinguished of the race of Yadu, have been realised by me now through direct perception as of this nature, i.e., of a nature unknown to me before. Such is the meaning.
11.18  Tvam aksaram etc.  Guardian of the pious acts of the Satvatas.  Satvatas are the same as the Satvatas i.e.  those who are established in the Truth that does not take cognizance of any difference between the Action  (11.Spanda)  and the Consciousness;  the Truth which is  nothing but Existentiality and is in the form of Awarenes.  Their  pious act is that  act  [of meditation] of theirs which - on account of its being  continously engaged in the process of undertaking and rejecting  [things] - consists of the act of emanation and absorption,  and is the most superior of  all the paths  [leading to salvation].  The Lord protects that pious act.  This is the secret in this chapter and it has been made almost clear by me  (11.Ag.) in my  (11.Ag.'s)  Vivrti (11.Commentary)  on the Devistotra  (11.Goddess-Hymn).  That is self-evident to the learned readers, with critical accuman, and initiation.  Hence, why to take recourse to the verbiage of explaining again and again what is already known very clearly.
11.18 Tvam, You; are the aksaram, Immutable; the paramam, supreme One, Brahman; veditavyam, to be known-by those aspiring for Liberation. You are the param, most perfect; nidhanam, repository-where things are deposited, i.e. the ultimate resort; asya visvasya, of this Universe, of the entire creation. Further. You are the avyayah, Imperishable-there is no decay in You; the sasvata-dharma-gopta, Protector (gopta) of the ever-existing (sasvata) religion (dharma). You are the sanatanah, eternal; transcendental purusah, Person. This is me, my; matah, belief-what is meant by me.
Moreover,
11.19 I see Thee without beginning, middle or end, infinite in power, of endless arms, the sun and the moon being Thy eyes, the burning fire Thy mouth, heating the whole universe with Thy radiance.
11.19 Without beginning, without middle and without end, infinite in power, Thine arms all-embracing, the sun and moon Thine eyes, Thy face beaming with the fire of sacrifice, flooding the whole universe with light.
11.19. I observe You having to beginning, no middle and no end; having infinite creative power, and infinite arms; as havig the moon and the sun for Your eyes, and the blazing fire for Your mouth; [and] as acorching this universe with Your rediance.
11.19 I behold You as without beginning, middle and end. Your might is infinite. You are endowed with an endless number of arms. The sun and moon are Your eyes. Your mouth is emitting burning fire. With Your own radiance You are warning the whole universe.
11.19 I see You as without beginning, middle and end, possessed of infinite valour, having innumerable arms, having the sun and the moon as eyes, having a mouth like a blazing fire, and heating up this Universe by Your own brilliance.
11.19 I behold You as without beginning, middle and end. Your might is infinite, of unsurpassed excellence. Here the term 'might' is used for illustration. The meaning is that You are the sole repository of knowledge, strength, sovereignty, valour, power and glory, one whose excellence cannot be surpassed. Your arms are infinite, i.e., they are countless. This is also for illustration, implying that You have an infinite number of arms, stomachs, feet, mouths etc. The sun and moon are Your eyes; all Your eyes are like the moon and the sun, beaming with grace and power. The grace is directed towards the devotees like the gods who offer salutations etc., and power is directed against Asuras, Raksasas etc., who are opposed to these. For it will be said later on:  'The Raksasas flee on all sides in fear, and all the hosts of Siddhas bow down to You' (11.36). Your mouth is emitting fire, namely, the fire appropriate for destroying all things, as the Fire of Time consumes the world at the time of dissolution. With Your own radiance You are warming the universe. By radiance (Tejas) is meant the poweer to vanish others. I behold You warming (or governing) the universe with Your own radiance. The meaning is this:  'I directly realise You' as taught before as the Creator of all, as the supporter of everything, as the sovereign over everything, as the destroyer of everything, as the ocean of knowledge and other infinite attributes, as without beginning, middle and end, and as possessing a divine body of this nature. How, in one divine body, can there be many stomachs etc.?  This is possible in the following way:  From a hip of infinite extent, stomachs etc., as described, branc off upwards. The divine feet etc., branch off downwards. So there is no contradiction in attributing a pair of eyes for each face.

'On perceiving You to be thus, the gods etc., and myself, have become frightened - says Arjuna in the following words:
11.19 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.19 Pasyami, I see; tvam, You; as anadi-madhya-antam, without beginning, middle and end; ananta-viryam, possessed of infinite valour; and also ananta-bahum, having innumerable arms; sasi-surya-netram, having the sun and the moon as the eyes; dipta-hutasavakram, having a mouth like a blazing fire; tapantam, heating up; idam, this; visvam, Universe; sva-tejasa, by Your own birlliance.
11.2 The origin and the destruction of beings verily have been heard by me in detail from Thee, O lotus-eyed Lord, and also Thy inexhaustible greatness.
11.2 O Lord, whose eyes are like the lotus petal! Thou hast described in detail the origin and the dissolution of being, and Thine own Eternal Majesty.
11.2. The origin and the dissolution of beings have been listened to in detail by me from You, O  Lotus-eyed One, and also to [Your] inexhaustible greatness.
11.2 The origination and dissolution of all beings, O Krsna, (as issuing from You) have been heard verily by me at length as also Your immutable greatness.
11.2 O you with eyes like lotus leaves, the origin and dissolution of beings have been heard by me in detail from You. ['From You have been heard the origin and dissolution of beings in You.'] And (Your) undecaying glory, too, (has been heard).
11.2 Likewise, beginning from the seventh, and ending with the tenth discourse, the origination and dissolution of all beings other than You, as issuing from You, the Supreme Self, have been heard at length by me. Your unlimited greatness, immutable and eternal, Your principalship (Sesitva) over all sentient and non-sentient things, Your supreme greatness consisting of the host of auspicious attributes like knowledge, strength etc., Your being the supporter of all things and actuator of all activities like thinking, blinking etc., have also been heard. Here the term, 'hi' (verily) expresses the desire to have the vision which is going to be revealed.
11.2 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.2 Kamala-partraksa, O You with eyes like lotus leaves; bhava-apyayau, the origin and dissolution- these two; bhutanam, of beings; srutau, have been heard; maya, by me; vistarasah, in detail-not in brief; tvattah, from You. Ca, and; (Your) avyayam, undecaying; mahatmyam, glory, too;-has been heard-(these last words) remain understood.
11.20 This space between the earth and the heaven and all the arters are filled by Thee alone; having seen this, Thy wonderful and teriible form, the three worlds are trembling with fear, O great-souled Being.
11.20 Alone thou fillest all the quarters of the sky, earth and heaven, and the regions between. O Almighty Lord! Seeing Thy marvellous and awe-inspiring Form, the spheres tremble with fear.
11.20. This space in between the heaven and the earth as well as all the directions are pervaded singly by You;  seeing this wondrous form of Yours as such, O Exalted Soul, the triple world is very  much frightened.
11.20 You alone have pervaded the interspace between heaven and earth, and all the arters. Beholding Your marvellous and terrible form, O Mahatman, the three worlds are greatly overwhelmed with fear.
11.20 Indeed, this intermediate space between heaven and earth as also all the directions are pervaded by You alone. O exalted One, the three worlds are struck with fear by seeing this strange, fearful form of Yours.
11.20 The terms, 'heaven and earth,' imply all the upper and lower worlds. The 'Antara', or that between heaven and earth, denotes the space between them in which are located all the worlds. You alone pervade all the space and all the arters. 'Beholding Your marvellous and teriible form,' beholding Your form of infinite length and extent, marvellous and terrible, the three worlds are trembling. Gods headed by Brahma, the Asuras, the manes, the Siddhas, the Gandharvas, the Yaksas, and Raksasas have come with a desire to see the battle. All the 'three worlds' consisting of these friendly, antagonistic and neutral beings are extremely frightened. 'Mahatman' means one, the dimension of whose mind has no limits. It has to be understood that like Arjuna, other beings also were granted by the Lord the divine eye capable of directly perceiving the Form which supports the universe. If it be asked why, the reply is that it was for demonstrating to Arjuna His sovereignty. Hence it is stated here:  'Beholding Your marvellous and terrible form, O Mahatman, the three worlds are greatly overwhelmed with fear.'
11.20 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.20 Hi, indeed; idam, this; antaram, intermediate space; dyavaprthivyoh, between heaven and earth; ca, as also; sarvah, all; the disah, direction; vyaptam, are pervaded; tvaya, by You; ekena, alone, who have assumed the Cosmic form. Mahatman, O exalted One, who by nature are high-minded; the lokatrayam, three worlds; pravyathitam, are struck with fear, or are perturbed; drstva, by seeing; idam, this; abdhutam, strange, astonishing; ugram, fearful, terrible; rupam, form; tava, of Yours.
Therefore, now, in order to clear that doubt which Arjuna earlier had-as in, 'whether we shall win, or whether they shall coner' (2.6)-, the Lord proceeds with the idea, 'I shall show the inevitable victory of the Pandavas.' Visualizing that, Arjuna said: 'Moreover-'.
11.21 Verily, into Thee enter these hosts of gods; some extol Thee in fear with joined palms; saying 'may it be well', bands of great sages and perfected ones praise Thee with hymns complete.
11.21 The troops of celestial beings enter into Thee, some invoking Thee in fear, with folded palms; the Great Seers and Adepts sing hymns to Thy Glory, saying All Hail.'
11.21. These hosts of gods enter into You; some frightened ones recite [hymns] with folded palms; simply crying  'Hail !',  the hosts of great seers praise You with the excellent praising hymns.
11.21 Verily into You the hosts of Devas enter. Some in fear extol You with clasped hands. Crying 'Hail' the bands of great seers and Siddhas praise You with meaningful hymns.
11.21 Those very groups of gods enter into You; struck with fear, some extol (You) with joined palms. Groups of great sages and perfected beings praise You with elaborate hymns,saying 'May it be well!'
11.21 These hosts of superior Devas beholding You as the foundation of the universe, rejoice and move towards You. Among them, some in fear, on seeing Your extremely terrible and wonderful form, 'extol,' namely pronounce sentences in the form of praise, according to their knowledge. Others, the bands of seers and Siddhas, knowers of the truth, higher and lower, saying 'Hail,' glorify You in hymns of abounding praise which are suitable to the Lord.
11.21 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.21 Ami hi, those very; sura-sanghah, groups of gods, the soldiers engaged in battle-groups of gods such as the Vasus who have descended here in the form of human beings for eliminating the burden of the earth; visanti, enter-are seen to be entering; tvam, You. Bhitah, struck with fear, and unable to flee; kecit, some among them; grnanti, extol You; pranjalayah, with their palms joined. Maharsi-siddha [Siddha: A semi-divine being supposed to be of great purity and holiness, and said to be particularly characterized by eight supernatural faculties called siddhis.-V.S.A.]-sanghah, groups of great sages and perfected beings; seeing protents foroding evil, etc. as the battle became imminent; stuvanti, praise; tvam, You; puskalabhih, with elaborate, full; stutibhih, hymns; uktva, saying; 'svasti iti, May it be well!'
And further,
11.22 The Rudras, Adityas, Vasus, Sadhyas, Visvedevas, the two Asvins, Maruts, the manes and the hosts of celestial singers, Yakshas, demons and the perfected ones, are all looking at Thee, in great amazement.
11.22 The Vital Forces, the Major stars, Fire, Earth, Air, Sky, Sun, Heaven, Moon and Planets; the Angels, the Guardians of the Universe, the divine Healers, the Winds, the Fathers, the Heavenly Singers; and hosts of Mammon-worshippers, demons as well as saints, are amazed.
11.22. The Rudras, the Adityas, the Vasus, the Sadhyas, the Visvas (Visvadevas), the twin Asvins and the Maruts, and the Steam-drinkers (Manes) and the hosts of the Gandharvas, the Yoksas, the demons and the perfected ones - all gaze on You and are ite amazed.
11.22 The Rudras, the Adityas, the Vasus, the Sadhyas, the Visvas, the Asvins, the Maruts and the manes, and the hosts of Gandharvas, Yaksas, Asuras, and Siddhas - all gaze upon You in amazement.
11.22 Those who are the Rudras, the Adityas, the Vasus and the Sadhyas [sadhyas: A particular class of celestial beings.-V.S.A.], the Visve (-devas), the two Asvins, the Maruts and the Usmapas, and hosts of Gandharvas, Yaksas, demons and Siddhas-all of those very ones gaze at You, being indeed struck with wonder.
11.22 Usmapa means manes, because the Sruti declares:  'Verily the manes receive the hot portions of the offerings' (Tai. Br., 1.3.10). All these, struck with amazement, behold You.
11.22 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.22 Ye, those who are; the rudra-adityah, Rudras and Adityas; vasavah, the Vasus; and sadhyah, the Sadhyas-the groups of Rudras and other gods; the gods visve, Visve-devas; and asvinau, the two Asvins; marutah, the Maruts; and usmapah, the Usmapas, (a class of) manes; and gandharva-yaksa-asura-siddha-sanghah, hosts of Gandharvas-viz Haha, Huhu and others-, Yaksas-viz Kubera and others-, demons-Virocana and others-, and Siddhas-Kapila and others; sarve eva, all of those very ones; viksante, gaze; tva, (i.e.) tvam, at You; vismitah eva, being indeed struck with wonder.
For,
11.23 Having seen Thy immeasurable form with many mouths and eyes, O mighty-armed, with many arms, thighs and feet, with many stomachs and fearful with many teeth  the worlds are terrified and so am I.
11.23 Seeing Thy stupendous Form, O Most Mighty, with its myriad faces, its innumerable eyes and limbs and terrible jaws, I myself and all the worlds are overwhelmed with awe.
11.23. O Mighty-armed One !  Having seen Your mighty form that has many faces and eyes, many arms, thighs and feet, and many bellies, and is terrible with many tusks; the worlds are frightened and so also myself.
11.23 Beholding Your great form with many mouths and eyes, with many arms, thights, and feet, witth many stomachs and terrible with many teeth, the worlds tremble, and I too ake, O mighty-armed.
11.23 O mighty-armed One, seeing Your immense form with many mouths and eyes, having numerous arms, thighs and feet, with many bellies, and fearful with many teeth, the creatures are struck with terror, and so am I.
11.23 Beholding Your mighty form, as described earlier, which is an exceedingly terrifying figure because of the large teeth - all the worlds, described earlier and containing three kinds of beings, friendly, antagonistic and neutral, and I myself too have become panic-stricken.
11.23 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.23 Mahabaho, O mighty-armed One; drstva, seeing; te, Your; mahat, immence, very vast; upam, form of this kind; bahu-vaktra-netram, with many mouths and eyes; bahu-bahu-uru-padam, having many arms, thighs and feet; and further, bahu-udaram, with many bellies; and bahu-damstra-karalam, fearful with many teeth; lokah, the creatures in the world; are pravya-thitah, struck with terror; tatha, and so also; am even aham, I. 
The reason of that is this:
11.24 On seeing Thee (the Cosmic Form) touching the sky, shining in many colours, with mouths wide open, with large fiery eyes, I am terrified at heart and find neither courage nor peace, O Vishnu.
11.24 When I see Thee, touching the Heavens, glowing with colour, with open mouth and wide open fiery eyes, I am terrified. O My Lord! My courage and peace of mind desert me.
11.24. As I observe You [with form]  touching the sky; blazing; having many colours, mouths wide open,  eyes blazing and large; I am terrified in my inner soul (mind); and I do not get courage and peace, O  Visnu !
11.24 When I behold You touching the Supreme Heaven, shining, multicoloured, with yawning mouths and large resplendent eyes, my inner being trembles in fear. I am unable to find support or peace, O Visnu.
11.24 O Visnu, verily, seeing Your form touching heaven, blazing, with many colours, open-mouthed, with fiery large eyes, I , becoming terrified in my mind, do not find steadiness and peace.
11.24 The term 'Nabhas' denotes the Supreme Heaven (Parama-Vyoman), which is beyond the Prakrti composed of the three Gunas as established by the Sruti passages such as:  'That is in the Imperishable Supreme Heaven' (Ma. Na. U., 1.2), 'Him, sun-coloured and beyond Tamas' (Sve., 3.8) 'The dweller beyond the Rajas' (Rg. S., 2.6.25.5) and 'He who is the president in the Supreme Heaven' (Rg. S., 8.9.17.7). This can be understood as implied in the statement that 'the form touches the Supreme Heaven.' It expresses the idea that it is the foundation of all - of the principle of the Prakrti with its conditions, and of the individual selves in all states. It has also been initially declared:  'For by You alone are pervaded the interspace of heaven and earth ৷৷.' (11.20). 'Beholding Your form shining, multicoloured, and with yawning mouths and large and resplendent eyes, my inner being trembles in fear. I am unable to find support, namely, I am unable to find support for the body. I am unable to get peace of mind and of the senses. O Visnu, namely, O Pervader, beholding You pervading everything, incomparable in magnitude, extremely wonderful and terrible, I find my limbs ivering and my senses agitated.' Such is the meaning.
11.24 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.24 O Visnu, hi, verily; drstva, seeing; tvam, You; nabhah-sprsam, touching heaven; diptam, blazing; aneka-varnam, with many colours, (i.e.) possessed of many frightening forms; vyatta-ananam, open-mouthed; dipta-visala-netram, with firey large eyes; I, pravyathita-antara-atma, becoming terrified in my mind; na vindami, do not find; dhrtim, steadiness; ca, and; samam, peace, calmness of mind.
Why?
11.25 Having seen Thy mouths fearful with teeth (blazing) like the fires of cosmic dissolution, I know not the four arters, nor do I find peace. Have mercy, O Lord of the gods, O abode of the universe.
11.25 When I see Thy mouths with their fearful jaws like glowing fires at the dissolution of creation, I lose all sense of place; I find no rest. Be merciful, O Lord in whom this universe abides!
11.25. By merely seeing Your faces that are frightening with tusks and are looking like the fire of destruction, I do not know the arters and get no peace.   Have mercy, O  Lord of gods !  O Abode of the Universe !
11.25 Viewing Your mouths, presenting awe-generating fangs and looking like the consuming fire of final destruction, I know not the arters of the globe nor do I find repose. Be gracious, O Lord of the Devas! O Abode of the universe!
11.25 Having merely seen Your mouths made terrible with (their) teeth and resembling the fire of Dissolution, I have lost the sense of direction and find no comfort. Be gracious, O Lord of gods, O Abode of the Universe.
11.25 Looking at Your mouths, extremely terrifying and like cosmic fire at the end of the universe, and operating for the destruction of everything, I have lost the sense of recognising the arters of the sky, nor do I feel happy and peaceful. O Abode of all the worlds, O Lord of all the Devas, namely, O Overlord of even gods like Brahma! Be gracious unto me. The meaning is:  'Do act in such a way that I may attain my natural condition.

Arjuna's charioteer (Parthasarathi), thus showing that all the worlds depend upon Him for their existence and activities, showed to the son of Prtha (Arjuna) that what He wanted to do, making Arjuna a mere instrument of His, was to lighten the burden of the earth through the destruction of all those who were of Asuric manifestations and who, in the guise of kings, were presenting themselves as the sons of Dhrtarastra and their followers. Many such embodiments of Asuras were present also in the ranks of Yudhisthira's followers. And Arjuna, after having realised with the divine eyes, received through His grace, the complete manifestation of the Lord as the Creator etc., witnessed also the slaughter of the followers of the sons of Dhrtarastra etc., in that Lord Himself, who is the Self of all, even though it (the slaughter) had not happened actually according to human calculations. Arjuna continues:
11.25 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.25 Drstva eva, having merely seen; te, Your; mukhani, mouths; damstra-karalani, made terrible with (their) teeth; and kala-anala-sannibhani, resembling the fire of Dissolution is kalanala; similar to that; na jane, I have lost; the sense of disah, direction-I do not know the directions as to which is East or which is West; and hence, na labhe, find no; sarma, comfort. Therefore, prasida, be gracious; devesa, O Lord of gods; jagannivasa, O Abode of the Universe!
'The apprehension which was there of my getting defeated by those offers, that too has cleared away, since-'
11.26 All the sons of Dhritarashtra, with the hosts of kings of the earth, Bhishma, Drona and Karna, with the chief among our warriors.
11.26 All these sons of Dhritarashtra, with the hosts of princes, Bheeshma, Drona and Karna, as well as the other warrior chiefs belonging to our side;
11.26. All these sons of Dhrtarastra  along with the entire hosts of kings, this Bhisma, this Drona and this son of the charioteer (Karna), together with the chief warriors of ours too;
11.26 All these sons of Dhrtarastra together with the hosts of monarchs, Bhisma, Drona and Karna along with the leading warriors of our side,
11.26 And into You (enter) all those sons of Dhrtarastra along with multitudes of the rulers of the earth; (also) Bhisma, Drona and that son of a Suta (Karna), together with even our prominent warriors.
11.26  11.27 All these sons of Dhrtarastra like Duryodhana and others like Bhisma, Drona, and Suta's son Karna together with the hosts of monarchs on their side and also the leading warriors on our side, are hastening to their destruction; they enter Your fearful mouths with terrible fangs; some, caught between the teeth are seen with their heads crushed to powder.
11.26 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.26 Ca, and; tvam, into You-this is to be connected with 'rapidly enter' in the next verse; sarve, all; ami, those; putrah, sons-Duryodhana and others; dhrtarastrasya, of Dhrtarastra; saha, along with; avanipala-sanghaih, multitudes of the rulers (pala) of the earth (avani); also Bhisma, Drona, tatha, and; asau, that; suta-putrah, son of a Suta, Karna; saha, together with; api, even; asmadiyaih, our; yodha-mukhyaih, prominent warriors, the ?nders-Dhrstadyumna and others.
Moreover,
11.27 Some hurriedly enter Thy mouths with their terrible teeth, fearful to behold. Some are found sticking in the gaps between the teeth with their heads crushed to powder.
11.27 1	see them all rushing headlong into Thy mouths, with terrible tusks, horrible to behold. Some are mangled between thy jaws, with their heads crushed to atoms.
11.27. They enter, hastening, into Your terrible mouths, frightening with tusks;  some  [of them], sticking in between Your teeth, are clearly visible with their heads powered.
11.27 Hasten to enter Your fearful mouths with terrible fangs. Some, caught between the teeth are seen with their heads crushed to powder.
11.27 They rapidly enter into Your terrible mouths with cruel teeths! Some are seen sticking in the gaps between the teeth, with their heads crushed!
11.26  11.27 All these sons of Dhrtarastra like Duryodhana and others like Bhisma, Drona, and Suta's son Karna together with the hosts of monarchs on their side and also the leading warriors on our side, are hastening to their destruction; they enter Your fearful mouths with terrible fangs; some, caught between the teeth are seen with their heads crushed to powder.
11.27 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.27 Visanti, they enter; tvarmanah, rapidly, in great haste; into te, Your; vaktrani, mouths;-what kind of mouths?-bhayanakani, terrible; damstra-karalani, with cruel teeth. Besides, among these who have entered the mouths, kecit, some; samdrsyante, are see; vilagna, sticking, like meat eaten; dasanantaresu, in the gaps between the teeth; uttamangaih, with their heads; curnitaih, crushed.
As to how they enter, he says:
11.28 Verily, just as many torrents of rivers flow towards the ocean, even so these heroes in the world of men enter Thy flaming mouths.
11.28 As rivers in flood surge furiously to the ocean, so these heroes, the greatest among men, fling themselves into Thy flaming mouths.
11.28. Just as many water-rapids of the rivers race heading towards the ocean alone, in the same manner these heroes of the world of men do enter into Your mouths flaming all around.
11.28 As many torrents of rivers flow towards the ocean, so do these heroes of the world of men enter Your flaming mouths.
11.28 As the numerous currents of the waters of rivers rush towards the sea alone so also do those heroes of the human world enter into Your blazing mouths.
11.28 - 11.29 These innumerable kings rush to their destruction in Your flaming mouths, even as many torrents of rivers flow towards the ocean and moths rush into a blazing fire.
11.28 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.28 Yatha, as; the bahavah, numerous; ambu-vegah, currents of the waters, particularly the swift ones; nadinam, of flowing rivers; dravanti abhimukhah, rush towards, enter into; the samudram, sea; eva, alone; tatha, so also; do ami, those; nara-loka-virah, heroes of the human world-Bhisma and others; visanti, enter into; tava, Your; abhi-vijvalanti, blazing, glowing; vaktrani, mouths.
Why do they enter, and how? In answer Arjuna says:
11.29 As moths hurriedly rush into a blazing fire for (their own) destruction, so also these creatures hurriedly rush into Thy mouths for (their own) destruction.
11.29 As moths fly impetuously to the flame only to be killed, so these men rush into Thy mouths to court their own destruction.
11.29. Just as with full speed, the moths enter into the flaming fire for their own destruction, in the same manner the worlds also do enter, for their own destruction with full speed, into the mouths of Yours.
11.29 As moths rush swiftly into a blazing fire to their destruction, so do these men swiftly rush into Your mouths to meet their destruction.
11.29 As moths enter with increased haste into a glowing fire for destruction, in that very way do the creatures enter into Your mouths too, with increased hurry for destruction.
11.28 - 11.29 These innumerable kings rush to their destruction in Your flaming mouths, even as many torrents of rivers flow towards the ocean and moths rush into a blazing fire.
11.29 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.29 Yatha, as; patangah, moths, flying insects; visanti, enter; samrddha-vegah, with increased haste; into a pradiptam, glowing; jvalanam, fire; nasaya, for destruction; tatha eva, in that very way; do the lokah, creatures; visanti, enter into; tava, Your; vaktrani, mouths; api, too; samrddha-vegah, with increased hurry; nasaya, for destruction.
You, again-
11.3 (Now) O Supreme Lord, as Thou hast thus described Thyself, O Supreme Person, I wish to see Thy divine form.
11.3 I believe all as Thou hast declared it. I long now to have a vision of thy Divine Form, O Thou Most High!
11.3. As You describe Yourself as the Supreme Lord [of all],  it must be so.  [Hence], O Supreme Self,  I desire to perceive  Your Lordly form.
11.3 O Supreme Lord, how You described Yourself, even so are You. I wish to see Your Lordly form, O Supreme Person.
11.3 O supreme Lord, so it is, as You speak about Yourself. O supreme Person, I wish to see the divine form of Yours.
11.3 O Supreme Lord, it is certain that it is even as you have described Yourself. O Supreme Person, O ocean of compassion for your dependants! I, however, wish to see or wish to realise directly, Your Lordly form peculiar to you - the form as the sovereign, protector, creator, destroyer, supporter of all, the mine of auspicious attributes, supreme and distinct from all other entities.
11.3 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.3 Parama-isvara, O supreme Lord; evam, so; etat, it is-not otherwise; yatha, as; tvam, You; attha, speak; atmanam, about Yourself. Still, purusottama, O supreme Person; iccahmi, I wish; drastum, to see; the aisvaram, divine; rupam, form; te, of Yours, of Visnu, endowed with Knowledge, Sovereignty, Power, Strength, Valour and Formidability.
11.30 Thou lickest up, devouring all the worlds on every side with Thy flaming mouths. Thy fierce rays, filling the whole world with radiance, are burning, O Vishnu!
11.30 Thou seemest to swallow up the worlds, to lap them in flame. Thy glory fills the universe. Thy fierce rays beat down upon it irresistibly.
11.30. Devouring, on all sides with Your blazing mouths, the entire worlds, You are licking up;  Your terrible rays scroch the entire universe filling it with their radiance, O Visnu !
11.30 Devouring all the worlds on every side with your flaming mouths, You lick them up. Your fiery rays, filling the whole universe with their radiance, scorch it, O Visnu.
11.30 You lick Your lips while devouring all the creatures from every side with flaming mouths which are completely filling the entire world with heat.
11.30 Devouring all these kings with Your flaming mouths, You lick them up, namely, lick up again and again in great anger. Your lips etc., are wet with their blood. Your fiery rays scorch the universe by the brilliant flow of radiance filling the whole universe.

You have manifested Yourself in this terrible form for revealing Your limitless sovereignty as reested by me thus:  'Reveal Yourself to me completely'(11.4), so that I may realise Your limitless sovereignty.
11.30 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.30 O Visnu, Your fierce rays are acorching. [M.S., S., and S.S. construe 'completely৷৷.heat' to alify 'fierce rays' in the second sentence. However, the use of kim ca (moreover) in the Comm. suggests the translation as above.-Tr.]
Lelihyase, You lick Your lips, You taste; grasamanah, while devouring, while taking in; samagran, all; lokan, the creatures; samantat, from all sides; jvaladbhih, with flaming; vadanaih, mouths; which are apurya, completely filling; samagram, the whole- together (saha) with the foremost (agrena); jagat, world; tejobhih, with heat. Moreover, O Visnu, the all-pervading One, tava, Your; ugrah, fierce; bhasah, rays; are pratapanti, scorching.
Since You are of such a terrible nature, therefore-
11.31 Tell me, who Thou art, so fierce of form. Salutations to Thee, O God Supreme: have mercy. I desire to know Thee, the original Being. I know not indeed Thy working.
11.31 Tell me then who Thou art, that wearest this dreadful Form? I bow before Thee, O Mighty One! Have mercy, I pray, and let me see Thee as Thou wert at first. I do not know what Thou intendest.
11.31. Please, tell me who You are with a terrible form;  O the Best of gods !  Salutation to You, please be merciful.  I am desirious of knowing You, the Primal One in detail; for I do not clearly comprehend Your behaviour.
11.31 Tell me who You are with this terrible form?  Salutation to You, O Supreme God. Be gracious. I desire to know You, the Primal One. I do not know Your activity.
11.31 Tell me who You are, fierce in form. Salutation be to you, O supreme God; be gracious. I desire to fully know You who are the Prima One. For I do not understand Your actions!
11.31 Who are You of this terrible form, what do You intend to do?  I wish to know. For I do not know Your intended actions. Tell me this. Salutations to You, O Supreme God! Salutations to You, Lord of everything! Say with what object and for what purpose You have assumed this form of the destroyer. Assume a pleasing form.

The Lord, the charioteer of Arjuna, being estioned, 'What is Your intention in assuming a terrible form when revealing Your cosmic sovereignty out of overflowing love for Your proteges?' - He spoke to the following effect:  The manifestation of a terrible form by Me is to point out that I Myself am operative for the annihilation of the entire world of kings headed by the sons of Dhrtarastra, without any effort on your (Arjuna's) part. Reminding Arjuna of this, is to goad him to fight:
11.31 Akhyahi etc.  I do not clearly comprehend  Your behaviour :  I.e. with what  intention this terrific nature of this sort  [has been assumed by You].
11.31 Akhyahi, tell; me; kah, who; bhavan, You are; ugrarupah, fierce in form. Namah, salutation; astu, be; te, to You; deva-vara, O supreme God, foremost among the gods. Prasida, be gracious. Icchami, I desire; vijnatum, to fully know; bhavantam, You; adyam, who are the Primal One, who exist in the beginning. Hi, for; na prajanami, I do not understand; tava, Your; pravrttim, actions!
11.32 The Blessed Lord said  I am the full-grown world-destroying Time, now engaged in destroying the worlds. Even without thee, none of the warriors arrayed in the hostile armies shall live.
11.32 Lord Shri Krishna replied: I have shown myself to thee as the Destroyer who lays waste the world and whose purpose is destruction. In spite of thy efforts, all these warriors gathered for battle shall not escape death.
11.32. The Bhagavat said  I am the Time, the world-destroyer, engaged here in withdrawing the worlds that are overgrown; even without you (your fighting)  all the warriors, standing in the rival armies, would cease to be.
11.32 The Lord said  I am the world-destroying Time. Manifesting Myself fully, I have begun to destroy the worlds here. Even without You, none of the warriors arrayed in the hostile ranks shall survive.
11.32 The Blessed Lord said  I am the world-destroying Time, [Time: The supreme God with His limiting adjunct of the power of action.] grown in stature [Pravrddhah, mighty-according to S.-Tr.] and now engaged in annihilating the creatures. Even without you, all the warriors who are arrayed in the confronting armies will cease to exist!
11.32 The Lord said  Kala (Time) is the calculator which calculates (Kalayati). Calculating the end of the lives of all those under the leadership of Dhrtarastra's sons, I am causing their destruction. Fully manifesting Myself with this fierce form, I have begun to destroy the hosts of kings. Therefore, by My will, even without you, namely, even without your effort, all these hostile warriors under the leadership of Dhrtarastra's sons, shall cease to be, i.e., will be destroyed.
11.32 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.32 Asmi, I am; the loka-ksaya-krt, world-destroying; kalah, Time; pravrddhah, grown in stature. Hear the purpose for which I have grown in stature: I am iha, now; pravrttah, engaged; samahartum, in annihilating; lokan, the creatures. Api, even; rte tva, without you; sarve, all-from whom your apprehension had arisen; the yodhah, warriors-Bhisma, Drona, Karna and others; ye, who are; avasthitah, arrayed; pratyanikesu, in the connfronting armies-in every unit of the army confronting the other; na bhavisyanti, will cease to exist.
Since this is so-
11.33 Therefore, stand up and obtain fame. Coner the enemies and enjoy the unrivalled kingdom. Verily by Me have they been already slain; be thou a mere instrument, O Arjuna.
11.33 Then gird up thy loins and conquer. Subdue thy foes and enjoy the kingdom in prosperity. I have already doomed them. Be thou my instrument, Arjuna!
11.33. Therefore, stand up, win glory, and  vanishing foes, enjoy the rich kingdom; these [foes] have already been killed by Myself;  [hence] be a mere token cause [in their destruction],  O ambidextrous archer !
11.33 Therefore airse, win glory. Conering your foes, enjoy a prosperous kingdom. By Me they have been slain already. You be merely an instrument, O Arjuna, you great bowman!
11.33 Therefore you rise up, (and) gain fame; and defeating the enemies, enjoy a prosperous kingdom. These have been killed verily by Me even earlier; be you merely an instrument, O Savyasacin (Arjuna).
11.33 Therefore, arise for fighting against them. Conering your enemies, win glory and enjoy a prosperous and righteous kingdom. All those who have sinned have been already annihilated by Me. Be you merely an instrument (Nimitta) of Mine in destroying them - just like a weapon in my hand, O Savyasacin! The root 'Sac' means 'fastening'. A 'savyasacin' is one who is capable of fixing or fastening the arrow even with his left hand. The meaning is that he is so dexterous that he can fight with a bow in each hand.
11.33 See comment under 11.34.
11.33 Tasmat, therefore; tvam, you; uttistha, rise up; (and) labhasva, gain; the yasah, fame, that Arjuna has conered the Atirathas [Atiratha-see note under 1.4.6.-Tr.], Bhisma, Drona and others, who are unconerable even by the gods. Such fame can be acired only by virtuous actions. Jitva, by defeating; satrun, the enemies, Duryodhana and others; bhunksva, enjoy; a rajyam, kingdom; that is samrddham, propersous, free from enemies and obstacles. Ete, these; nihatah, have been definitely killed, made lifeless; eva maya, verily by Me; eva purvam, even earlier. Bhava, be you; nimitta-matram, merely an instrument, O Savyasachin. Arjuna was called so because he could shoot arrows even with his left hand.
11.34 Drona, Bhishma, Jayadratha, Karna and other brave warriors  these are already slain by Me: do thou kill; be not distressed with fear; fight and thou shalt coner thy enemies in battle.
11.34 Drona and Bheeshma, Jayadratha and Karna, and other brave warriors - I have condemned them all. Destroy them; fight and fear not. Thy foes shall be crushed."
11.34. Slay Drona and Bhisma, and  Jayadratha, and Karna as well as the other heroes of the world-all already slain by Me.  Do not get distressed; fight; you shall vanish enemies in the battle.
11.34 Slay Drona, Bhisma, Jayadratha, Karna as well as other mighty warriors, who have been doomed by Me. Do not feel distressed. Fight, You shall coner your rivals in the battle.
11.34 You destroy Drona and Bhisma, and Jayadratha and Karna as also the other heroic warriors who have been killed by Me. Do not be afraid. Fight! You shall coner the enemies in battle.
11.34 Say Drona, Bhisma, Karna, etc., who have ben chosen for destruction by me alone, as they have transgressed the law of righteousness. Be not distressed, considering, 'How can I slay these teachers, relations and others who are attached to enjoyments?'  Do not be thus distressed by thinking about the right and wrong of it, or out of love and compassion for them. These persons are guilty of unrighteousness by siding with the evil-minded Duryodhana. They have been chosen by Me alone for destruction. Therefore fight without doubt. You shall conqer your enemies in battle. In slaying them, there is not the slighest trace of cruelty. The purport is that victory is the sure result.
11.33-34 Tasmat etc.  Drona etc.  The world is of the nature of perfect and imperfect knowledge and it is swallowed  (11.completely controlled)  by the power of the perfect,  imperfect and  mixed  Consciousness.   Hence, here an answer is given accordingly by the Bhagavat.  This secret is a almost  indicated in this chapter.  Yet  for the benefit of those  persons who are capable of understanding only what has been clearly marked, let us (11.Ag.)  assume the misfortune of taking the trouble of writing a few lines.
 
What is declared by the Bhagavat - viz.,  'As the foes have been slain  [by Me],  be a token cause and win glory',  this is by way of answering to what Arjuna has said earlier viz.,  'We do not know who, amongst both of us,  is more powerful than the other etc.  (11.II, 6)'.
11.34 By saying, 'who have been killed by Me,' the Lord names Drona and those very warriors with regard to whom Arjuna had (his) doubts.
Now then, uncertainty with regard to Drona and Bhisma is well-founded. Drona was the teacher of the science of archery, and was eipped with heavenly weapons; and particularly, he was his (Arjuna's) own teacher and most respected. Bhisma was destined to die at will, and possessed heavenly weapons. He fought a duel with Parasurama and remained unvanished. So also Jayadratha-whose father was performing an austerity with the idea that anyone who made his son's head fall on the ground would have even his own head fall. Since Karna also was eipped with an unerring spear given by Indra, and was a son of the Sun, born of a maiden (Kunti), therefore he is referred to by his own name itself.
As a mere instrument, tvam, you; jahi, destory them; who have been hatan, killed; maya, by Me. Ma, do not; vyathisthah, be afraid of them. Yuddhyasva, fight. Jetasi, you shall coner; the sapatnan, enemies-Duryodhana and others; rane, in battle.
11.35 Sanjaya said  Having heard that speech of Lord Krishna, Arjuna, with joined palms, trembling, prostrating himself, again addressed Krishna, in a choked voice, bowing down, overwhelmed with fear.
11.35 Sanjaya continued: "Having heard these words from the Lord Shri Krishna, the Prince Arjuna, with folded hands trembling, prostrated himself and with choking voice, bowing down again and again, and overwhelmed with awe, once more addressed the Lord.
11.35. Sanjaya said  On hearing this  speach of Kesava, the crowned-prince (Arjuna) had his palms folded; and trembling he protstrated himself to Krsna; and stammering, and being very much afraid and bowing down, he spoke to Him again.
11.35 Sanjaya said  Having heard this speech of Krsna, Arjuna did Him obeisance; and trembling with awe, he bowed down again, and with folded palms, and trembling, he spoke to Krsna in a choked voice.
11.35 Sanjaya said  Hearing this utterance of Kesava, Kiriti (Arjuna), with joined palms and trembling, protrating himself, said again to Krsna with a faltering voice, bowing down overcome by fits of fear:
11.35 Sanjaya said  Having heard the speech of Krsna, ocean of affection for the seekers of refuge in Him, Arjuna did obeisance to Him. Trembling with fear, he bowed again and again before Him. With folded palms, and trembling, Arjuna spoke in a choked voice with emotion.
11.35 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.35 Srutva, hearing; etat, this, aforesaid; vacanam, utterance; kesavasya, of Kesava; Kiriti, krtanjalih, with joined palms; and vepamanah, trembling; nama-skrtva, prostrating himself; aha, said; bhuyah eva, again; krsnam, to Krsna; sa-gadgadam, with a faltering voice-.
A person's throat becomes choked with phlegm and his eyes full of tears when, on being struck with fear, he is overcome by sorrow, and when, on being overwhelmed with affection, he is filled with joy. The indistinctness and feleness of sound in speech that follows as a result is what is called faltering (gadgada). A speech that is accompanied with (saha) this is sa-gadgadam. It is used adverbially to the act of utterance.
Pranamya, bowing down with humility; bhita-bhitah, overcome by fits of fear, with his mind struck again and again with fear-this is to be connected with the remote word aha (said).
At this juncture the words of Sanjaya have a purpose in view. How? It is thus: Thinking that the helpless Duryodhana will be as good as dead when the four unconerable ones, viz Drona and others, are killed, Dhrtarastra, losing hope of victory, would conclude a treaty. From that will follow peace on either side. Under the influence of fate, Dhrtarastra did not even listen to that!
11.36 Arjuna said  It is meet, O Krishna, that the world delights and rejoices in Thy praise; demons fly in fear to all arters and the hosts of the perfected ones bow to Thee.
11.36 Arjuna said: My Lord! It is natural that the world revels and rejoices when it sings the praises of Thy glory; the demons fly in fear and the saints offer Thee their salutations.
11.36. Arjuna said  O Lord of sense-organs (Krsna) !  It is appropriate that the universe rejoices and feels  exceedingly delighted by the high glory of yours;  that in fear the demons fly on all directions; and that the hosts of the perfected ones bow down [to You].
11.36 Arjuna said  Rightly it is, O Krsna, that Your praise should move the world to joy and love. The Raksasas flee in fear on all sides, and all the hosts of Siddhas bow down to You.
11.36 Arjuna said  It is proper, O Hrsikesa, that the world becomes delighted and attracted by Your praise; that the Raksasas, stricken with fear, run in all directions; and that all the groups of the Siddhas bow down (toYou).
11.36 Arjuna said:  'Sthane' means rightly or it is but proper. It is but proper that the whole world of gods, Gandharvas, Siddhas, Yaksas, Kinnaras, Kimpurusas, etc., who have foregathered with a desire to see the battle, should be delighted with You and love You after beholding You by Your grace.

You are the Lord of all. Rightly after beholding You, the Raksasas flee in fear on all sides, and rightly all the host of Siddhas, namely, the host of Siddhas who are favourable to You, pay their homage to You. The connection with what was said earlier is that all this is as it ought to be.

He further proceeds to explain how all this is right:
11.36 Sthane etc.  By  high glory : by highly singing  the glory.
11.36 Sthane, it is proper; -what is that?-that the jagat, world; prahrsyati, becomes delighted; tava prakirtya, by Your praise, by reciting Your greatness and hearing it. This is befitting. This is the idea. Or, the word sthane may be taken as alifying the word 'subject' (understood) : It is proper that the Lord is the subject of joy etc. since the Lord is the Self of all beings and the Friend of all.
So also it (the world) anurajyate, becomes attracted, becomes drawn (by that praise). That also is with regard to a proper subject. This is how it is to be explained.
Further, that the raksamsi, Raksasas; bhitani, stricken with fear; dravanti, run; disah, in all directions-that also is with regard to a proper subject. And that sarve, all; the siddha-sanghah, groups of the Siddhas-Kapila and others; namasyanti, bow down-that also is befitting.
He points out the reason for the Lord's being the object of delight etc.:
11.37 And why should they not, O great Soul, bow to Thee Who art greater (than all else), the primal cause even of the Creator (Brahma), O Infinite Being, O Lord of the gods, O Abode of the universe; Thou art the imperishable, the Being, the non-being and That which is the supreme (that which is beyond the Being and the non-being).
11.37 How should they do otherwise? O Thou Supremest Self, greater than the Powers of creation, the First Cause, Infinite, the Lord of Lords, the Home of the universe, Imperishable, Being and Not-Being, yet transcending both.
11.37. O Mighty One !  Why should they not bow down to You, the Primal Creater, Who are greater than even Brahma (personal god) ?  O Endless One, O Lord of gods, O Abode of the universe !  You are unalterable, existent, non-existent and also that which is beyond both.
11.37 (a) And why should they not, O Mahatman, bow down to You who are great, being the first Creator, even of Brahma?

(b) O Infinite, Lord of gods, O You who have the universe for Your abode! You are the imperishable individual self, the existent and the non-existent, and that which is beyond both.
11.37 And why should they not bow down to You, O exalted [i.e. not narrow-minded.] One, who are greater (than all) and who are the first Creator even of Brahma! O infinite One, supreme God, Abode of the Universe, You are the Immutable,being and non-being, (and) that which is Transcendental.
11.37 O Mahatman, for what reason should Brahma and others not bow down to You, who are great and are the First Being and the Creator even of Brahma, namely, Hiranyagarbha?

O Infinite, O Lord of the gods, O You who have the universe for Your abode! You are the 'Aksara'. What does not perish, is the Aksara, here, the 'principle of individual self'; for the individual self does not perish as established in Sruti passages:  'The intelligent self is not born, nor dies' (Ka. U., 1.2.18). You alone are the 'existent and the non-existent,' the principle of Prakrti, in its condition as effect and in its condition as cause. This is denoted by the terms 'Sat' (existent) and 'Asat' (non-existent). You alone are the state of effect denoted by the term 'Sat', which is the state of diversification by names and forms, and also the state of cause, denoted by the tetm 'Asat', which is the state incapable of such divisions and diversities. 'What is beyond both' - what is beyond Prakrti and the individual self associated with the Prakrti, as also from the principle of liberated selves who are different from those associated with Prakrti, i.e., bound souls. You alone are that also.

Therefore:
11.37 Kasmat etc.  Existent  (11.Sat) :  i.e. as a purport of words  (11.or as material object).  Non-existent  (11.Asat) :  Because, the Absolute does not become an object of perception.  Or Asat signifies negation;  [in fact]  it is also well connected with the words which denote it directly, or indicate it indirectly by denoting what contains it; it also enjoys a form  (11.becomes an object) of  knowledge  (11.of its own);  and  [hence]  is has no separate existence other than the existence of the Absolute  Brahman ?  (11.It is)  beyond  both the existent and  non-existent :  For,  It is realised when the knowledge  of both of them disappears.				(11.38)
11.37 Ca, and; since You are the Primal Creator, the Cause, api, even; brahmanah, of Brahma, of Hiranyagarbha; therefore, kasmat, why, for what reason; should they na nameran, not bow down; te, to You; mahatman, O exalted One; gariyase, who are greater (than all)! Hence, why should these not bow down adi-karte, to the first Creator? Therefore You are fit for, i.e. the fit object of, delight etc. and salutation as well.
Ananta, O infinite One; devesa, supreme God; jagannivasa, Abode of the Universe; tvam, You; are the aksaram, Immutable; tat param yat, that which is Transcendental, which is heard of in the Upanisads;-what is that?-sad-asat, being and nonbeing. Being is that which exists, and non-being is that with regard to which the idea of nonexistence arises. (You are) that Immutable of which these two-being and non-being-become the limiting adjuncts; which (Immutable), as a result, is metaphorically referred to as being and non-being. But in reality that Immutable is transcendental to being and non-being. 'That Immutable which the knowers of the Vedas declare' (8.11; cf. Ka. 1.2.15)-that is You Yourself, nothing else. This is the idea.
He praises again:
11.38 Thou art the primal God, the ancient Purusha, the supreme refuge of this universe, the knower, the knowable and the supreme Abode. By Thee is the universe pervaded, O Being of infinite forms.
11.38 Thou art the Primal God, the Ancient, the Supreme Abode of this universe, the Knower, the Knowledge and the Final Home. Thou fillest everything. Thy form is infinite.
11.38. You are the Primal God;  You are the Ancient Soul; You are the transcending place of rest for this universe; You are the knower and the knowable; You are the Highest Abode;  and the universe with its infinite forms is pervaded by You.
11.38 (a) You are the Primal God and the Ancient Person. You are the Supreme resting place of the universe৷৷.

(b)৷৷.You are the knower and that which must be known, and the Supreme abode. By You, O infinite of form, is this universe pervaded.
11.38 You are the primal Deity, the ancient Person; You are the supreme Resort of this world. You are the knower as also the object of knowledge, and the supreme Abode. O You of infinite forms, the Universe is pervaded by You!
11.38 You alone are all the knowers and all that must be known. You alone, abiding thus as the Self of all, are the 'Dhaman' (abode), namely, the goal to be attained. By You, O infinite of form, is the universe pervaded. By You the universe, composed of conscient beings and non-conscient matter, is 'Tatam', pervaded. You are the Primal God, the Ancient Person. You are the supreme resting place of the universe. The meaning is that You are the supreme foundation of the universe which constitutes Your body, as You are its Self. [It is to be noted how Ramanuja derives here the meaning of 'individual self' for the word Aksara, which helps him to explain 'Kutasth'oksara ucchyate' in 15.16]

Arjuna says:  'Therefore You alone are expressed by the terms Vayu etc.'
11.38 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.38 You are the adi-devah, primal Deity, because of being the creator of the Universe; the puranah, ancient, eternal; purusah, Person-(derived) in the sense of 'staying in the town (pura) that is the body'. You verily are the param, suprem; nidhanam, Resort, in which this entire Universe comes to rest at the time of final dissolution etc. Besides, You are the vetta, knower of all things to be known. You are also the vedyam, object of knowledge-that which is fit to be known; and the param, supreme; dhama, Abode, the supreme State of Visnu. Anantarupa, O You of infinite forms, who have no limit to Your own forms; the entire visvam, Universe; tatam, is pervaded; tvaya, by You.
Further,
11.39 Thou art Vayu, Yama, Agni, Varuna, the moon, the Creator, and the great-grandfather. Salutations, salutations unto Thee, a thousand times, and again salutations, salutations unto Thee.
11.39 Thou art the Wind, Thou art Death, Thou art the Fire, the Water, the Moon, the Father and the Grandfather. Honour and glory to Thee a thousand and a thousand times! Again and again, salutation be to Thee, O my Lord!
11.39. You are Vayu, Yama, Agni, Varuna, the Moon, Prajapati and  the Great-paternal-grand-father; Salutation and salutation thousand times to You;  and again also more salutation and salutation to You.
11.39 (a) You are Yayu, Yama, Agini, Varuna, Sasanka, Prajapati and the great-grandsire৷৷.

(b) ৷৷. Hail, Hail unto You, a thousand times! Hail unto You again and yet again!
11.39 You are Air, Death, Fire, the god of the waters, the moon, the Lord of the creatures, and the Greater-grandfather. Salutations! Salutation be to You a thousand times; salutation to You again and again! Salutation!
11.39 You alone are the great-grandsire of all and also grandfather etc. The Prajapatis are the fathers of all creatures. Hiranyagarbha (Brahma), the father of the Prajapatis, is the grandsire of all creatures. You, being the father of even Hiranyagarbha, are great grandfather of all creatures. You alone are denoted by the several terms by which these beings are known. Such is the meaning.

Beholding the Lord in a most marvellous form, Arjuna, bent with great awe, saluted Him from all sides with his eyes widely open from joy.
11.39 See comment under 11.40.
11.39 You are vayuh, Air; yamah, Death; and agnih, Fire; varunah, the god of the waters; sasankah, the moon; prajapatih, the Lord of the creatures- Kasyapa and others [See note on p.2.-Tr.]; and pra-pitamahah, the Great-grandfather, i.e. the Father ever of Brahma (Hiranyagarbha). Namo, salutations; namah, salutation; astu, be; te, to You; sahasra-krtvah, a thousand times. Punah ca bhuyah api namo te, salutation to You again and again; namah, salutation!
The suffix krtvasuc (after sahasra) indicates performance and repetition of the act of salutation a number of times. The words punah ca bhuyah api (again and again) indicate his own dissatisfaction [Dissatisfaction with only a few salutations.] owing to abundance of reverence and devotion.
So also,
11.4 If Thou, O Lord, thinkest it possible for me to see it, do Thou, then, O Lord of the Yogins, show me Thy imperishable Self.
11.4 If Thou thinkest that it can be made possible for me to see it, show me, O Lord of Lords, Thine own Eternal Self.
11.4. O Master !  If you think that it is possible for me to see that form, then, O Lord of the Yogins, please show me Your Immortal Self.
11.4 If you think, O Lord, that it can be seen by me, then, O Lord of Yoga, reveal Yourself to me completely.
11.4 O Lord, if You think that it is possible to be seen by me, then, O Lord of Yoga, You show me Your eternal Self.
11.4 If You think that Your form as all-creator, as all-ruler and as all-supporter, can be seen by me, then, O Lord of Yoga - Yoga is the property of having knowledge and other auspicious attributes, for it will be said later on:  'Behold My Lordly Yoga' (11.8) - O treasure of knowledge, strength, sovereignty, valour, power and glory which are inconceivable in any one else! Reveal Yourself to me completely. 'Avyayam' (completely) is an adverb. The meaning is, 'Reveal everything about Yourself to me.'

Thus, prayed to by Arjuna, who was desirous to know, and whose voice was therefore choked with fervour, the Lord said as follows to him:
11.4 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.4 Prabho, O Lord, Master; yadi, if; manyase, You think; iti, that; tat sakyam, it is possible; drastum, to be see; maya, by me, by Arjuna; tatah, then, since I am very eager to see, therefore; yogeswara, O Lord of Yoga, of yogis-Yoga stands for yogis; their Lord is yogeswara; tvam, You; darsaya, show; me, me, for my sake; atmanam avyayam, Your eternal Self.
Being thus implored by Arjuna,
11.40 Salutations to Thee, in front and behind! Salutations to Thee on every side! O All!! Thou infinite in power and prowess, pervadest all; wherefore Thou art all.
11.40 Salutations to Thee in front and on every side, Thou who encompasseth me round about. Thy power is infinite; Thy majesty immeasurable; thou upholdest all things; yea,Thou Thyself art All.
11.40. Salutation to You in the front and behind;  salutation to You, just on all sides, O One Who are All ! You are of infinite might and of immeasurable powers;  and You pervade all and hence You are all.
11.40 (a) Salutation to You from before and behind! Salutation to You from all sides, O All!৷৷.

(b) ৷৷. O You of infinite prowess and heroic action which are measureless! You pervade all beings and therefore are all.
11.40 Salutation to You in the East and behind. Salutation be to You on all sides in deed, O All! You are possessed of infinite strength and infinite heroism. You pervade everything; hence You are all!
11.40 You, of infinite prowess and measureless heroic action, pervade all beings as their very Self and therefore, are, in reality all of them. Terms, naming all other entities, are truly naming You; for they, both sentient as well as non-sentient, constitute Your body, and as such are just Your modes. Therefore You alone, having them all as Your modes, are signified by all terms standing for them. In the texts, 'O by You of infinite form, is the cosmos pervaded' (11.38) and 'You pervade all, and hence are all' (11.40), it is clearly stated that the pervasion as the Self is the only rationale for speaking of them as one with You, in the sense of co-ordinate predication as in the text, 'You are the imperishable and also being and non-being' (11.37) and 'You are Vayu, Yama and Agni' (11.39).
11.39-40 Namo  namah etc.  Salutation and salutation :  This  repetition reveals the intensity of the devotion.  What has been taught by the past chapters by the Bhagavat regarding His own intrinsic nature,  Arjuna - witnessing the same by perception - declares it openly by way of devotional hymn.  Hence, to comment on the hymn would  symply amount to the repetition  [of what has already been said by us].  Hence, let me  (11.Ag.)  abstain [from commenting on it].
11.40 Namah, salutation to You; purastat, in the East; atha, and; even prsthatah, behind. Salutation be sarvatah, on all sides; eva, indeed; te, to You who exist everywhere; sarva, O All! Tvam, You; are ananta-virya-amita-vikramah, possessed of infinite strength and infinite heroism. virya is strength, and vikramah is heroism. Someone though possessing strength for the use of weapons etc. [Ast. reads 'satru-vadha-visaye, in the matter of killing an enemy'.-Tr.] may lack heroism or have little heroism. But You are possessed of infinite strength and infinite heroism.
Samapnosi, You pervade, interpenetrate; sarvam, everything, the whole Universe, by Your single Self. Tatah, hence; asi, You are; sarvah, All, i.e., no entity exists without You.
'Since I am guilty of not knowing Your greatness, therefore,'-
11.41 Whatever I have presumptuously said from carelessness or love, addressing Thee as O Krishna! O Yadava! O Friend! regarding Thee merely as a friend, unknowing of this, Thy greatness.
11.41 Whatever I have said unto Thee in rashness, taking Thee only for a friend and addressing Thee as O Krishna! O Yadava! O Friend!' in thoughtless familiarity, no understanding Thy greatness;
11.41. Taking You for a  [mere]  companion, not knowing this greatness of Yours,  and out of my carelessness or through even affection, whatever I have importunately called You as O Krsna,  O Yadava, O Comrade; and,
11.41 Unaware of this majesty of Yours, and either from negligence or love, or considering You to be a friend, whatever I have rudely said as 'O Krsna, O Yadava, O Comrade.'
11.41 Without knowing this greatness of Yours, whatever was said by me (to You) rashly, through inadvertence or even out of intimacy, thinking (You to be) a friend, addressing (You) as 'O krsna,' 'O Yadava,' 'O friend,' etc.-.
11.41 - 11.42 Infinite power, boundless valour, being the Inner Self of everything, being the creator etc., these constitute Your majesty. Being ignorant of this, and considering You only as a friend, and out of conseent love, or negligence born of life-long familiarity, whatever has been said rudely, without showing courtesy, such as 'O Krsna, O Yadava, O Comrade'; and whatever disrespect has been shown to You in jest, while playing or resting, while sitting or eating, while alone or in the sight of others - for all these I beseech forgiveness of You who are in incomprehensible.
11.41 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.41 Like a fool, ajanata, without knowing-. Not knowing what? In answer he says: idam, this; mahimanam, greatness-the Cosmic form; tava, of Yours, of God; yat, whatever; uktam, was said; maya, by me (to You); prasabham, rashly, slightingly; pramadat, through inadvertence, being in a distracted state of mind; va api, or even; pranayena, out of intimacy-itimacy is the familiarity arising out of love; whatever I have said because of that reason; erroneously matva, thinking (You); sakha iti, to be a friend, of the same age; iti, addressing You as, 'O Krsna,' 'O Yadava,' 'O friend,'-.
In the clause, 'tava idam mahimanam, ajanata, without knowing this greatness of Yours,' idam (this) (in the neutor gender) is connected with mahimanam (greatness) (in masculine gender) by a change of gender. If the reading be tava imam, then both the words would be in the same gender.
11.42 In whatever way I may have insulted Thee for the sake of fun, while at play, reposing, sitting or at meals, when alone (with Thee), O Krishna, or in company  that I implore Thee, immeasurable one, to forgive.
11.42 Whatever insult I have offered to Thee in jest, in sport or in repose, in conversation or at the banquet, alone or in a multitude, I ask Thy forgiveness for them all, O Thou Who art without an equal!
11.42. Whatever disrespect was shown by me to You, to make fun of You in the course of play, or while on the bed, or on the seat, or at meals, either alone, or in the presence of repectable persons - for that I beg pardon of You, the Unconceivable  One, O Acyuta !
11.42 And whatever disrespect has been shown to You in jest, while playing, resting, while sitting or eating, while alone or in the sight of others, O Acyuta - I implore You for forgiveness, You who are incomprehensible.
11.42 And that You have been discourteously treated out of fun-while walking, while on a bed, while on a seat, while eating, in privacy, or, O Acyuta, even in public, for that I beg pardon of You, the incomprehensible One.
11.41 - 11.42 Infinite power, boundless valour, being the Inner Self of everything, being the creator etc., these constitute Your majesty. Being ignorant of this, and considering You only as a friend, and out of conseent love, or negligence born of life-long familiarity, whatever has been said rudely, without showing courtesy, such as 'O Krsna, O Yadava, O Comrade'; and whatever disrespect has been shown to You in jest, while playing or resting, while sitting or eating, while alone or in the sight of others - for all these I beseech forgiveness of You who are in incomprehensible.
11.42 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.42 And, yat, that; asi, You have been; asatkrtah, discourteously treated, slighted; avahasa-artham, out of fun, with a veiw to mocking;-where?-in these, Acyuta, viz vihara-sayya-asana-bhojanesu, while walking [Walking, i.e. sports or exercise], while on a bed, while on a seat, and while eating;-that You have been insulted ekah, in privacy, in the absence of others; adhava, or; that You have been insulted api, even; tat-samaksam, in public, in the very presence of others-(-tat being used as an adverb); tat, for that, for all those offences; O Acyuta, aham, I; ksamaye, beg pardon; tvam, of You; aprameyam, the incomprehensible One, who are beyond the means of knowledge.
(I beg Your pardon) because,
11.43 Thou art the Father of this world, moving and unmoving. Thou art to be adored by this world, Thou, the greatest Guru; (for) none there exists who is eal to Thee; how then could there be another superior to Thee in the three worlds, O Being of unealled power?
11.43 For Thou art the Father of all things movable and immovable, the Worshipful, the Master of Masters! In all the worlds there is none equal to Thee, how then superior, O Thou who standeth alone, Supreme.
11.43. You are the father of the world of the moving and unmoving;  You are the great preceptor of this universe; in the triad of worlds there is no one eal to You-How can there be anyone else superior ? - having greatness not comprehended.
11.43 You are the father of this world, of all that moves and that does not move. You are its teacher and the one most worthy of reverence. There is none eal to You. How then could there be in the three worlds another greater than You, O Being of matchless greatness?
11.43 You are the Father of all beings moving and non-moving; to this (world) You are worthy of worship, the Teacher, and greater (than a teacher). There is none eal to You; how at all can there be anyone greater even in all the three worlds, O You or unrivalled power?
11.43 O Being of matchless greatness! You are the father of this world, of all that moves and does not move. You are the teacher of this world. Therefore You are the one most worthy of reverence in this world of mobile and immobile entities. There is none eal to You. How then could there be in the three worlds another greater than You?  No other being is eal to You in point of any attribute like compassion etc. How could there be any one greater?

Inasmuch as You are the father of all, the most worthy of reverence, teacher and exalted over all by virtue of attributes like compassion etc.,
11.43 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.43 Asi, You are; pita, the Father, the Progenitor; lokasya, off all beings; cara-acarasya, moving and nonmoving. Not only are Yur are Father of this world, You are also pujyah, worthy of worship; since You are the guruh, Teacher; [He is the Teacher since He introduce the line of teachers of what is virtue and vice, and of the knowledge of the Self. And He is greater than a teacher because He is the teacher even of Hiranyagarbha and others.] gariyan, greater (than a teacher). How are You greater? In answer he says: Asti, there is; na, none other; tvat-samah, eal to You; for there is no possibility of two Gods. Because all dealings will come to naught if there be many Gods! When there is no possibility of another being eal toYou, kutah eva, how at all; can there be anyah, anyone; abhyadhikah, greater; api, even; loka-traye, in all the three worlds; apratima-prabhavah, O you of unrivalled power?
That by which something is measured is pratima. You who have no measure for Your power (prabhava) are a pratima-prabhavah. Apratima-prabhava means 'O You of limitless power!'
Since this is so,
11.44 Therefore, bowing down, prostrating my body, I crave Thy forgiveness, O adorable Lord. As a father forgives his son, a friend his (dear) friend, a lover his beloved, even so shouldst Thou 
forgive me, O God.
11.44 Therefore I prostrate myself before Thee, O Lord! Most Adorable! I salute Thee, I ask Thy blessing. Only Thou canst be trusted to bear with me, as father to son, as friend to friend, as lover to his beloved.
11.44. Hence, paying homage, and prostrating may body,  I solicit grace of You, the Lord praisworthy.  O God !  Be pleased to bear with me, just as a beloved father with his beloved son and just as a dear friend with his dear friend.
11.44 Therefore, bowing down, prostrating the body. I implore Your mercy, O adorable Lord. As a father hears with his son or a friend with his friend, it is meet, O Lord, that You, who are dear to me, should bear with me who am dear to You.
11.44 Therefore, by bowing down and prostrating the body, I seek to propitate You who are God and are adorable. O Lord, You should [The elision of a (in arhasi of priyayarhasi) is a metrical licence.] forgive (my faults) as would a father (the faults) of a son, as a friend, of a friend, and as a lover of a beloved.
11.44 Therefore, bowing down and prostrating, I implore You, O adorable Lord, for Your mercy. Just as, when entreated with salutation, a father will show mercy to his son, or a friend to a friend, even if he has been at fault, even so it is meet that You, most compassionate and dear to me, should bear with me, who is dear to You in all respects.
11.44 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.44 Tasmat, therefore; pranamya, by bowing down; and pranidhaya kayam, prostrating, laying, the body completely down; prasadaye, I seek to propitiate; tvam, You; who are isam, God, the Lord; and are idyam, adorable. Deva, O God; You are Your part, arhasi, should; sodhum, bear with, i.e. forgive (my faults); iva, as would; a pita, father; forgive all the faults putrasya, of a son; and as a sakha, friend; the fautls sakhyuh, of a friend; or as a priyah, lover; forgives the faults priyayah, of a beloved.
11.45 I am delighted, having seen what has never been seen before; and yet my mind is distressed with fear. Show me that (previous) form only, O God; have mercy, O God of gods, O Abode of the universe.
11.45 I rejoice that I have seen what never man saw before; yet, O Lord! I am overwhelmed with fear. Please take again the Form I know. Be merciful, O Lord! thou Who are the Home of the whole universe.
11.45. I am thrilled by seeing what has not been seen earlier;  and my mind is very much distressed with fear;  show me the same (usual) form of Yours; kindly be appeased O God !  Lord of gods !  O Abode of the worlds !
11.45 Seeing what was never seen before, I am delighted. But my mind is also agog with awe. Show me, O Lord! Your other form. O Lord of the gods! Be gracious, O Abode of the universe!
11.45 I am delighted by seeing something not seen heretofore, and my mind is stricken with fear. O Lord, show me that very form; O supreme God, O Abode of the Universe, be gracious!
11.45 Seeing Your form, never seen before, extremely marvellous and awe-inspiring, I am delighted, transported with love. But my mind is also troubled with awe. Hence reveal to me only Your most gracious form. Be gracious, O Lord of all gods! O Abode of the universe! Show me that form, O gracious Lord of all the gods headed by Brahma, and the foundation of the entire universe!
11.45 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.45 Asmi, I am; hrsitah, delighted; drstva, by seeing; adrsta-purvam, something not seen heretofore-by seeing this Cosmic form of Yours which has never been seen before by me or others. And me, my; manah, mind; is pravyathitam, stricken; bhayena, with fear. Therefore, deva, O Lord; darsaya, show; me, to me; tat eva, that very; rupam, form, which is of my friend. Devesa, O supreme God; jagan-nivasa, Abode of the Universe; prasida, be gracious!
11.46 I desire to see Thee as before, crowned, bearing a mace, with the discus in hand, in Thy former form only, having four arms, O thousand-armed, Cosmic Form (Being).
11.46 I long to see Thee as thou wert before, with the crown, the sceptre and the discus in Thy hands; in Thy other Form, with Thy four hands, O Thou Whose arms are countless and Whose forms are infinite.
11.46. I desire to see You in the same manner, wearing crown, holding the club and the discuss in hand; please be with the same form having four hands, O Thousand-armed One !  O Universal Form !
11.46 I wish to see You ever as before, with crown and with mace and discus in hand. Assume again that four-armed shape, O Thou the thosand armed, of Universal Form!
11.46 I want to see You just as before, wearing a crown, wielding a mace, and holding a disc in hand. O You with thousand arms, O You of Cosmic form, appear with that very form with four hands.
11.46 I wish to see You thus, as before, with a crown, and with a mace and discus in hand. Hence assume again that four-armed shape, shown to me before, O thousand-armed one of Universal Form! Assume that shape in place of what You have now revealed with thousand arms and a cosmic body. Such is the meaning.
11.46 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.46  
Aham, I; icchami, want; drastum, to see; tvam, You; kiritinam, wearing a crown; as also gadinam, wielding a mace; and cakra-hastam, holding a disc in hand; i.e., tatha eva, just as before. Since this is so, therefore, sahasra-baho, O You with a thousand arms-in Your present Cosmic form; visva-murte, O you of Cosmic form; bhava, apeear; tena eva rupena, with that very form-with the form of the son of Vasudeva; caturbhujena, with four hands. The idea is: withdrawing the Cosmic form, appear in that very form as the son of Vasudeva.
Noticing Arjuna to have become afraid, and withdrawing the Cosmic form, reassuring him with sweet words-
11.47 The Blessed Lord said  O Arjuna, this Cosmic Form has graciously been shown to thee by Me by My own Yogic power; full of splendour, primeval, and infinite, this Cosmic Form of Mine has never been seen before by anyone other than thyself.
11.47 Lord Shri Krishna replied: My beloved friend! It is only through My grace and power that thou hast been able to see this vision of splendour, the Universal, the Infinite, the Original. Never has it been seen by any but thee.
11.47. The Bhagavat said  Being gracious towards you, I have shown you, O Arjuna, this supreme form, as a result of  [Your]  concentration on the Self; this form of Mine full of splendour universal , unending  and primal, has been never seen before by anybody other than your-self.
11.47 The Lord said  By My grace, O Arjuna this Supreme Form, luminous, universal, infinite, primal, never seen before by anyone but you, has been revealed to you through My own free will.
11.47 The Blessed Lord said  Out of grace, O Arjuna, this supreme, radiant, Cosmic, infinite, primeval form-which (form) of Mine has not been seen before by anyone other than you, has been shown to you by Me through the power of My own Yoga.
11.47 The Lord said  The 'luminous' form of Mine is a mass of luminosity. It is 'universal' i.e., constitutes the Self of the universe. It is 'infinite', endless. This is illustrated by describing it as having no beginning, middle or end. It is 'primeval,' namely, it constitutes the foundation of all beings other than Myself. It has nevr been seen before by any one other than you. Such a form is now revealed to you, who are My devotee, by Me who am gracious, by My own Yoga, namely, by the power of willing the truth associated with Me.

Sri Krsna proceeds to say, 'It is not possible that I can be realised as I am, through any means except exclusive Bhakti.'
11.47 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.47 Prasannena, out of grace-grace means the intention of favouring you; O Arjuna, idam, this; param, supreme; tejomayam, abundantly radiant; visvam, Cosmic, all-comprehensive; anantam, infinite, limitless; adyam, primeval-that which existed in the beginning; rupam, form, the Cosmic form; yat which form; me, of Mine; na drsta-purvam, has not been seen before; tvat-anyena, by anyone other than you; daristam, has been shown; tava, to you; maya, by Me-who am racious, being possessed of that (intention of favouring you); atma-yogat, through the power of My own Yoga, through the power of My own Godhood.
'You have certainly got all your ends accomplished by the vision of the form of Mine who am the Self [The word atmanah (who am the Self) does not occur in some editions.-Tr.] .' Saying so, He eulogizes that (vision):
11.48 Neither by the study of the Vedas and sacrifices, nor by gifts nor by rituals nor by severe austerities can I be seen in this form in the world of men by any other than thyself, O great hero of the Kurus (Arjuna).
11.48 Not by study of the scriptures, not by sacrifice or gift, not by ritual or rigorous austerity, is it possible for man on earth to see what thou hast seen, O thou foremost hero of the Kuru-clan!
11.48. Not by the knowledge of the Vedas and sacrifices, nor by making gifts, nor by the rituals, nor by severe austerities, can I be seen in this form in the world of men,  by anybody other than yourself, O the great hero of the Kurus !
11.48 Neither through the study of the Vedas, nor by sacrifices, nor by recitals of the scriptures, nor by gifts, nor by rituals, nor by strict austerities can I be realised in a form like this in the world of men by any one else but you. O Arjuna!
11.48 Not by the study of the Vedas and sacrifices, not by gifts, not even by rituals, not by severe austerities can I, in this form, be perceived in the human world by anyone ['By anyone who has not received My grace'. other than you, O most valiant among the Kurus.
11.48 In this form, which represents My real nature, I cannot be realised by such means as study of the Vedas, sacrifices etc., by anyone who is bereft of exclusive Bhakti towards Me or by any one other than yourself who has complete devotion towards Me.
11.48 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.48 Na veda-yajna-adhyayanaih, not by the study of the Vedas and sacrifices, (i.e.) not by the methodical study of even the four Vedas and the study of the sacrifices-since the study of the sacrifices is achieved by the very study of the Vedas, the separate mention of the study of sacrifices is for suggesting detailed knowledge of sacrifices; [This separate mention of the study of sacrifices is necessary because the ancients understood the study of Vedas to mean learing them by rote.] so also, na danaih, not by gifts-in such forms as distributing wealth eal to the weight of the giver; na ca kriyabhih, not even by rituals-by Vedic and other rituals like Agnihotra etc.; nor even ugraih tapobhih, by severe austerities such a Candrayana [A religious observance or expiatory penance regulated by the moon's phases. In it the daily antity of food, which consists of fifteen mouthfuls at the full-moon, is curtailed by one mouthful during the dark fornight till it is reduced to nothing at the new moon; and it is increased in a like manner during the bright fortnight.-V.S.A.] etc. which are frightful; sakyah aham, can I; evam rupam, in this form-possessing the Cosmic form as was shown; drastum, be perceived; nrloke, in the human world; tvad-anyena, by anyone other than you; kuru-pravira, O most valiant among the Kurus.
11.49 Be not afraid, nor bewildered on seeing such a teriible form of Mine as this; with thy fear dispelled and with a gladdened heart, now behold again this former form of Mine.
11.49 Be not afraid or bewildered by the terrible vision. Put away thy fear and, with joyful mind, see Me once again in My usual Form."
11.49. Let there be no distress and no bewilderment in you by seeing this terrific and violent form of Mine; being free from fear, cheerful at heart, behold again this form of Mine which is the same [as before].
11.49 You need not fear any more, nor be perplexed, looking on this awesome form of Mine. Free from fear and with a gladdened heart, behold again that other form of Mine.
11.49 May you have no fear, and may not there be bewilderment by seeing this form of Mine so terrible Becoming free from fear and gladdened in mind again, see this very earlier form of Mine.
11.49 Whatever fear and whatever perlexity have been caused to you by seeing My terrible form, may it cease now. I shall show you the benign form to which you were accustomed before. Behold now that form of Mine.
11.49 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.49 Ma te vyatha, may you have no fear; and ma vimudha-bhavah, may not there be bewilderment of the mind; drstva, by seeing, perceiving; idam, this rupam, 
form; mama, of Mine; idrk ghoram, so terrible, as was revealed. Vyapetabhih, becoming free from fear; and becoming prita-manah, gladdened in mind; punah, again; prapasya, see; idam, this; eva, very; tat, earlier; rupam, form; me, of Mine, with four hands, holding a conch, a discus and a mace, which is dear to you.
11.5 The Blessed Lord said  Behold, O Arjuna, forms of Mine, by the hundreds and thousands, of different sorts, divine, and of various colours and shapes.
11.5 Lord Shri Krishna replied: Behold, O Arjuna! My celestial forms, by hundred and thousands, various in kind, in colour and in shape.
11.5. The Bhagavat said  Behold,  O son of Prtha, My divine forms in hundreds and in thousands and of varied nature and of varied colours and varied shapes.
11.5 The Lord said  Behold My forms, O Arjuna, hundreds upon thousands, manifold, divine, varied in hue and shape.
11.5 The Blessed Lord said  O son of Prtha, behold My forms in (their) hundreds and in thousands, of different kinds, celestial, and of various colours and shapes.
11.5 The Lord said  Behold My forms which are the foundation of all, hundreds upon thousands, varied and possessing manifold modes. They are divine, i.e., supernatural. They are multi-formed and multi-coloured like white, black etc. And they are of varied configurations. Behold that form!
11.5 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.5 O son of Prtha, pasya, behold; me, My; rupani, forms; satasah, in (their) hundreds; atha, and; sahasrasah, in thousands, i.e. in large numbers. And they are nana-vidhani, of different kinds; divyani, celestial, supernatural; and nana-varna-akrtini, of various colours and shapes-forms which have different (nana) colours (varna) such as blue, yellow, etc. as also (different) shapes (akrtayah), having their parts differently arranged.
11.50 Sanjaya said  Having thus spoken to Arjuna, Krishna again showed His own form and the great Soul (Krishna), assuming His gentle form, consoled him (Arjuna) who was terrified.
11.50 Sanjaya continued: "Having thus spoken to Arjuna, Lord Shri Krishna showed Himself again in His accustomed form; and the Mighty Lord, in gentle tones, softly consoled him who lately trembled with fear.
11.50. Having said to Arjuna as above, Vasudeva revealed His own tiny form; assuming His gentle body once again, the Mighty Soul (Krsna)  consoled the frightened Arjuna.
11.50 Sanjaya said  Having spoken thus to Arjuna, Sri Krsna revealed to him once more His own form. The Mahatman, assuming again a benign form, reassured him who had been struck with awe.
11.50 Sanjaya said  Thus, having spoken to Arjuna in that manner, Vasudeva showed His own form again. And He, the exalted One, reassured this terrified one by again becoming serene in form.
11.50 Sanjaya said  Having spoken thus to Arjuna, the Lord, the son of Vasudeva, revealed His own four-armed form. And the Mahatman, i.e., one whose resolves are always treu, reassured him who was terror-stricken on seeing ann unfamiliar form, by resuming the familiar pleasant form. Possession of His own four-armed form alone is proper to this Lord of all, the Supreme Person, the Supreme Brahman, when he has assumed the human form for blessing this world as the son of Vasudeva. But in answer to the prayer of Vasudeva, who was terrified by Kamsa, the two extra arms were withdrawn till the destruction of Kamsa. These became manifest again. For He was prayed to thus:  'You are born, O Lord, O Lord of gods, withdraw this form bearing conch, discus and mace out of grace ৷৷. withdraw this form of four arms, O Self of all' (V. P., 5.3.10 and 13). Even to Sisupala, who hated Him, this form of four arms of Sri Krsna was the object of constant thought, as described in:  'Him who is of four long and robust arms, bearing the conch, discus and the mace' (V. P., 4.15.10). Hence Arjuna also exclaimed here; 'Assume again that four-armed shape' (11.46).
11.51 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.50 Iti, thus; uktva, having spoken; arjunam, to Arjuna; tatha, in that manner, the words as stated above; Vasudeva darsayamasa, showed; svakam, His own; rupam, form, as was born in the house of Vasudeva; bhuyah, again. And the mahatma, exalted One; asvasayamasa, reassured; enam, this; bhitam, terrified one; bhutva, by becoming; punah, again; saumya-vapuh, serene in form, graceful in body.
11.51 Arjuna said  Having seen this Thy gentle human form, O Krishna, now I am composed and am restored to my own nature.
11.51 Arjuna said: Seeing Thee in Thy gentle human form, my Lord, I am myself again, calm once more.
11.51. Arjuna said  On seeing this gentle human form of Yours, O Janardana, now I have regained my nature and have now collected my thinking faculty.
11.51 Arjuna said  Having behold the human and pleasing form of Yours, O Krsna, I have now become composed in mind and I am restored to my normal nature.
11.51 Arjuna said  O Janardana, having seen this serene human form of Yours, I have now become calm in mind and restored to my own nature.
11.51 Arjuna said  Having beheld this pleasing and unie form of Yours, human in configuration, endowed with grace, tenderness, beauty etc., the excellence of which is infinite, I have now become composed, and I am restored to my normal nature.
11.51  Drstva etc.  At the end of the act of withdrawing all, the Brahman assumes the highly tranil stage of the tattva.  Hence at the stage of withdrawl, gentleness is in the  Bhagavat.
11.51 O Janardana, drstva, having seen; idam, this; saumyam, serene; manusam, human; rupam, form; tava, of Yours-gracious, as of my friend; asmi, I have; idanim, now; samvrttah, become;-what?-sacetah, calm in mind; and gatah, restored; prakrtim, to my own nature.
11.52 The Blessed Lord said  Very hard indeed it is to see this form of Mine which thou hast seen. Even the gods are ever longing to behold it.
11.52 Lord Shri Krishna replied: It is hard to see this vision of Me that thou hast seen. Even the most powerful have longed for it in vain.
11.52. The Bhagavat said  This form of Mine, which you have just observed is extremely difficult to observe; even gods are always curious of observing this form.
11.52 The Lord said  It it very hard to behold this form of Mine which you have seen. Even the gods ever long to behold this form.
11.52 The Blessed Lord said  This form of Mine which you have seen is very difficult to see; even the gods are ever desirous of a vision of this form.
11.52 The Lord said  This form of Mine which you have seen, and which has the whole universe under control, which is the foundation of all and which forms the origin of all - this cannot be beheld by any one. Even the gods ever long to see this form; but they have not seen it.

Why?  Sri Krsna says:
11.52 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.52 Idam, this; rupam, form; mama, of Mine; yat, which; drstavan, asi, you have seen is; sudur-darsam, very difficult to see. Api, even; the devah, gods; are nityam, ever; darsana-kanksinah, desirous of a vision; asya, of this; rupasya, form of Mine. The idea is that though they want to see, they have not seen in the way you have, nor will they see!
Why so?
11.53 Neither by the Vedas nor by austerity, nor by gift, nor by sacrifice can I be seen in this form as thou hast seen Me (so easily).
11.53 Not by study of the scriptures, or by austerities, not by gifts or sacrifices, is it possible to see Me as thou hast done.
11.53. Neither by reciting Vedas, no by obseving austerity, nor by offering gifts, nor by performing sacrifice, can I be observed in this manner as you have see Me now.
11.53 Sri Krsna says  Not by the Vedas, nor by austerities, nor by gifts, nor by sacirifce, can I seen in such a form as You have seen Me.
11.53 Not through the Vedas, not by austerity, not by gifts, nor even by sacrifice can I be seen in this form as you have seen Me.
11.53 - 11.54 Sri Krsna says  By Vedas, i.e., by mere study, teaching etc., of these sacred texts, it is not possible to know Me truly. It is also not possible through meditation, sacrifices, gifts and austerities, destitute of devotion towards Me. But by single-minded devotion i.e., by devotion characterised by extreme ardour and intensity, it is possible to know Me in reality through scriptures, to behold Me directly in reality, and enter into Me in reality. So describes a Sruti passage:  'This Self cannot be obtained by instruction, nor by intellect nor by much hearing. Whomsoever He chooses, by him alone is He obtained. To such a one He reveals His own form' (Ka. U., 2.2.23) and (Mun. U., 3.2.3).
11.53 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.53 Na vedaih, not through the Vedas, not even through the four Vedas-Rk, Yajus, Sama and Atharvan; na tapasa, not by austerity, not by severe austerities like the Candrayana; not danena, by gifts, by gifts of cattle, land, gold, etc.; na ca, nor even; ijyaya, by sacrifices or worship; sakyah aham, can I; drastum, be seen evamvidhah, in this form, in the manner as was shown; yatha, as; drstavan asi, you have seen mam, Me.
'How again, can You be seen? This is being answered:
11.54 But by single-minded devotion can I, of this Form, be known and seen in reality and also entered into, O Arjuna.
11.54 Only by tireless devotion can I be seen and known; only thus can a man become one with Me, O Arjuna!
11.54. But, through an undeviating devotion, it is possible to know, and to observe and also to enter into Me as such, O Arjuna !  O scorcher of foes !
11.54 But by single-minded devotion, O Arjuna, it is possible to truly know, to see and to enter into Me, who am of this form, O harasser of foes.
11.54 But, O Arjuna, by single-minded devotion am I-in this form-able to be known and seen in reality, and also be entered into, O destroyer of foes.
11.53 - 11.54 Sri Krsna says  By Vedas, i.e., by mere study, teaching etc., of these sacred texts, it is not possible to know Me truly. It is also not possible through meditation, sacrifices, gifts and austerities, destitute of devotion towards Me. But by single-minded devotion i.e., by devotion characterised by extreme ardour and intensity, it is possible to know Me in reality through scriptures, to behold Me directly in reality, and enter into Me in reality. So describes a Sruti passage:  'This Self cannot be obtained by instruction, nor by intellect nor by much hearing. Whomsoever He chooses, by him alone is He obtained. To such a one He reveals His own form' (Ka. U., 2.2.23) and (Mun. U., 3.2.3).
11.54 See comment under 11.55
11.54 Tu, but, O Arjuna; bhaktya, by devotion-. Of what kind? To this the Lord says: Ananyaya, by (that devotion which is ) single-minded. That is called single-minded devotion which does not turn to anything else other than the Lord, and owing to which nothing else but Vasudeva is perceived by all the organs. With that devotion, aham sakyah, am I able; evamvidhah, in this form-in the aspect of the Cosmic form; jnatum, to to known-from the scriptures; not merely to be known from the scriptures, but also drastum, to be seen , to be realized directly; tattvena, in reality; and also pravestum, to be entered into-for attaining Liberation; parantapa, O destroyer of foes.
Now the essential purport of the whole scripture, the Gita, which is meant for Liberation, is being stated by summing it up so that it may be practised:
11.55 He who does all actions for Me, who looks upon Me as the Supreme, who is devoted to Me, who is free from attachment, who bears enmity towards no creature, he comes to Me, O Arjuna.
11.55 He whose every action is done for My sake, to whom I am the final goal, who loves Me only and hates no one - O My dearest son, only he can realize Me!"
11.55. He, who performs actions for [attaining] Me; who regards Me as his supreme goal; who is devoted to Me; who is free from attachment; and who is free from hatred towards all beings-he attains me, O son of Pandu !
11.55 Whosoever works for Me, looks upon Me as the highest and is devoted to Me, free from attached and without enmity towards any creature, he comes to Me, O Arjuna.
11.55 O son of Pandu, he who works for Me, accepts Me as the supreme Goal, is devoted to Me, is devoid of attachment and free from enmity towards all beings-he attains Me.
11.55 Whosoever performs all acts like the study of the Vedas described above, considering them as several modes of worship, 'he works for Me.' He who 'looks upon Me as the highest,' namely, one to whom I alone am the highest purpose in all his enterprises, has Me as 'the highest end.' He who is 'devoted to me,' i.e., is greatly devoted to me and hence unable to sustain himself without reciting My names, praising Me, meditating upon Me, worshipping Me, saluting Me etc., he who performs these always considering Me as the supreme end - he is My devotee. He is 'free from attachments,' as he is attached to me alone, and is therefore unable to have attachment to any other entity. He who is without hatred towards any being, is one who fulfils all the following conditions:  his nature is to feel pleasure or pain solely on account of his union or separation from Me; he considers his own sins to be the cause of his sufferings (and not the work of others); he is confirmed in his faith that all beings are dependent on the Parama-purusa. For all these reasons he has no hatred for any one.
11.54-55 Bhaktya etc. Mat-karma etc.  Those, whose devotion, charming by the absence of any other object in it, bursts forth-to the field of realisation of those persons descends the Vasudea - tattva, the Absolute being, without any effort (on their part)  just on account of their appreciation of the advice given earlier as 'Having the realisation that Vasudeva is all, one takes refuge in Me. etc.'
11.55 Pandava, O son of Pandu; yah, he who; mat-karma-krt, works for Me: work for Me is mat-karma; one who does it is mat-karma-krt-.
Mat-paramah, who accepts Me as the supreme Goal: A servant does work for his master, but does not accept the master as his own supreme Goal to be attained after death; his one, however, who does work for Me, accepts Me alone as the supreme Goal. Thus he is matparamah-one to whom I am the supreme Goal-.
So also he who is madbhaktah, devoted to me: He adores Me alone in all ways, with his whole being and full enthusiasm. Thus he is madbhaktah-.
 
Sanga-varjitah, who is devoid of attachment for wealth, sons, friends, wife and relatives, Sanga means fondness, love; devoid of them-.
Nirvairah, who is free from enmity; sarva-bhutesu, towards all beings-berefit of the idea of enmity even towards those engaged in doing unmost harm to him-.
Sah, he who is such a devotee of Mine; eti, attains; mam, Me. I alone am his supreme Goal; he does not attain any other goal. This is the advice for you, given by Me as desired by you.
11.6 Behold the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the two Asvins and also the Maruts; behold many wonders never seen before, O Arjuna.
11.6 Behold thou the Powers of Nature: fire, earth, wind and sky; the sun, the heavens, the moon, the stars; all forces of vitality and of healing; and the roving winds. See the myriad wonders revealed to none but thee.
11.6. Behold the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the twin Asvins, and the Maruts;  O son of Pandu, behold also many wonders that had never been seen before.
11.6 Behold the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the two Asvins and the Maruts. Behold, O Arjuna, many marvels never seen before.
11.6 See the Adiyas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the two Asvins and the Maruts. O scion of the Bharata dynasty, behold also the many wonders not seen before.
11.6 Behold in My single form (i.e., the many forms in the one form revealed to Arjuna), the twelve Adityas, eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, the two Asvins and forty-nine Maruts. This is just illustrative. Behold all those things directly perceived in this world and those described in the Sastras, and also many marvels, not seen before in all the worlds and in all the Sastras.
11.6 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.6 Pasya, see; adityan, the twelve Adityas; vasun, the eight Vasus; rudran, the eleven Rudras; asvinau, the two Asvins; and amarutah, the Maruts, who are divided into seven groups of seven each. Bharata, O scion of the Bharata dynasty; pasya, behold; tatha, also; bahuni, the many other; ascaryani, wonders; adrstapurvani, not seen before-by you or anyone else in the human world.
Not only this much,-
11.7 Now behold, O Arjuna, in this, My body, the whole universe centred in one  including the moving and the unmoving  and whatever else thou desirest to see.
11.7 Here in Me living as one, O Arjuna, behold the whole universe, movable and immovable, and anything else that thou wouldst see!
11.7. Now, behold the entire universe, including the moving and the unmoving, and whatsoever else you desire to see-all established in one here, in My body, O Gudakesa (Arjuna) !
11.7 Behold here, O Arjuna, the whole universe with its mobile and immobile things centred in My body and whatever else you desire to see.
11.7 See now, O gudakesa, O Gudakesa (Arjuna), the entire Universe together with the moving and the non-moving, concentrated at the same place here in My body, as also whatever else you would like to see.
11.7 'Here', in this one body of Mine, and even there, gathered together in a single spot, behold the universe with all mobile and immobile entities. Whatever else you desire to see (i.e., Arjuna's chances of victory), behold that also in one part of this single body.
11.7 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.7 Pasya, see; adya, now; O Gudakesa, the krtsnam, entire; jagat, Universe; sa-cara-acaram, existing together with the moving and the non-moving; ekastham, concentrated at the same place; iha, here; mama dehe, in My body; ca, as also; yat anyat, whatever else-even those victory, defeat, etc. with regard to which you expressed doubt in, 'whether we shall win, or whether they shall coner us' (2.6); if icchasi, you would like; drastum, to see them.
11.8 But thou art not able to behold Me with these thine own eyes; I give thee the divine eye; behold My lordly Yoga.
11.8 Yet since with mortal eyes thou canst not see Me, lo! I give thee the Divine Sight. See now the glory of My Sovereignty."
11.8. But, you cannot see Me simply with this eye of yours [Hence],  I give you the divine eye.  [Now]  behold the Lordly form of   Mine.
11.8 But you will not be able to see Me with your own eye. I give you a divine eye. Behold My Lordly Yoga!
11.8 But you are not able to see Me merely with this eye of yours. I grant you the supernatural eye; bhold My divine Yoga.
11.8 I shall reveal to you the whole universe in one part of my body. But, with your physical eye, which can see only limited and conditioned things, you cannot behold Me, such as I am, different in  kind from everything else and illimitable. So I bestow on you, a divine, namely, supernatural, eye by which you may perceive Me. Behold My Lordly Yoga' (sovereign endowment)! Behold My unie Yoga (special power)! The meaning is, 'Behold My Yoga such as infinite knowledge and such other attributes and endless manifestations of lordly power!'
11.8 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.8 Tu, but; na sakyase, you are not able; drastum, to see; mam, Me, who have assumed the Cosmic form; eva, merely; anena, with this natural; sva-caksusa, eye of yours. However, dadami, I grant; te, you; the divyam, supernatural; caksuh, eye, by which supernatural eye you shall be able to see Pasya, behold with that; me, My, God's aisvaram, divine; yogam, Yoga, i.e. the superabundance of the power of Yoga [The power of accomplishing the impossible.-M.S.].
11.9 Sanjaya said  Having thus spoken, O king, the great Lord of Yoga, hari (Krishna), showed to Arjuna His supreme form as the Lord.
11.9 Sanjaya continued: "Having thus spoken, O King, the Lord Shri Krishna, the Almighty Prince of Wisdom, showed to Arjuna the Supreme Form of the Great God.
11.9. Sanjaya said  O king !  Having thus stated,  Hari (Krsna), the mighty Lord of the Yogins, showed to the son of  Prtha [His own]  Supreme Lordly form;
11.9 Sanjaya said  Having spoken, O King, Sri Krsna, the gread Lord of Yoga, then revealed to Arjuna the supreme Lordly Form.
11.9 Sanjaya said  O King, having spoken thus, thereafter, Hari [Hari: destroyer of ignorance along with its conseences.] (Krsna) the great Master of Yoga, showed to the son of Prtha the supreme divine form:
11.9 Sanjaya said  Having thus spoken, Sri Krsna, who is the great Lord of Yoga, namely, the Lord of supremely wonderful attributes - Sri Krsna who is Narayana, the Supreme Brahman now incarnated as the son of Arjuna's maternal uncle and seated as a charioteer in his chariot - showed Arjuna, the son of Pritha His paternal aunt, that Lordly form uniely His own, which is the ground of the entire universe, which is manifold and wonderful, and which rules over everything.

And that form was like this:
11.9 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
11.9 Rajan, O King, Dhrtarastra; uktva, having spoken evam, thus, in the manner stated above; tatah, thereafter; harih, Hari, Narayana; maha-yogeswarah, the great Master of Yoga-who is great (mahan) and also the master (isvara) of Yoga; darasyamasa showed; parthaya, to the son of Prtha; the paramam, supreme; aisvaram, divine; rupam, form, the Cosmic form:
12.1 Arjuna said  Those devotees who, ever steadfast, thus worship Thee and those also who worship the imperishable and the unmanifested  which of them are better versed in Yoga?
12.1 "Arjuna asked: My Lord! Which are the better devotees who worship Thee, those who try to know Thee as a Personal God, or those who worship Thee as Impersonal and Indestructible?
12.1. Arjuna said  Those devotees who, being constantly attached [to You], worship You thus;  and also those who [worship] the motionless Unmanifest-of these who who are the best knowers of Yoga ?
12.1 Arjuna said  Those devotees, who, ever integrated, thus meditate on You, and those again, who meditate on the Imperishable and the Unmanifest - which or these have greater knowledge of Yoga?
12.1 Arjuna said  Those devotees who, being thus ever dedicated, meditate on You, and those again (who meditate) on the Immutable, the Unmanifested-of them, who are the best experiencers of yoga [(Here) yoga means samadhi, spiritual absorption.] ?
12.1 Arjuna said  These are two types of spiritual aspirants who are contrasted thus:  (1) 

On the one hand there are those devotees who adore You 'thus'; namely, in the way taught in such text as 'Whosoever works for Me' (11.55), and who are  desirous of being ever 'integrated' with You, namely, considering You as the supreme end. They adore You in utter devotion - You, the ocean of boundless attributes of limitless excellence like grace, affability, omniscience, true resolve etc., and endowed with all glory. (2) On the other hand there are those who meditate on the 'Imperishable', (Aksara) namely, the individual self in Its true nature, which is the same as the 'Unmanifest' (Avyakta), namely that whose nature cannot be grasped by organs such as the eye etc. The estion posed is:  Which of these two classes of devotees have greater knowledge of Yoga?  Who would reach their respective goals sooner?  Such is the meaning of the estion. Sri Krsna clearly states later on, 'O Arjuna, I become before long their redeemer from the fatal sea of recurring births and deaths' (12.7), with reference to the speed with which the latter kind of devotees reach Him.
12.1 Evam etc.  The estion is for getting an explanation regarding the superiority  among those who are the worshippers of the Absolute with Sovereign power,  by the said method and those who worship the Self alone  [without any attribute].
12.1 The subject-matter stated in the immediately preceding verse, '৷৷.he who works for Me,' etc. is referred to by the word evam (thus).
Ye bhaktah, those devotees who, seeking no other refuge; evam, thus; satata-yuktah, being ever-devoted, i.e., remaining unceasingly engaged in the works of the Lord, etc., intent on the aforesaid purpose; paryupasate, meditate; tvam, on You, in the Cosmic form as revealed earlier; ye ca api, and those others, again, who have renounced all desires, who have given up all actions; who meditate on Brahman as described (below), aksaram, on the Immutable; avyaktam, on the Unmanifested, which is so on account of being bereft of all limiting adjuncts, (and) which is beyond the comprehension of the organs-in the world, whatever comes within the range of the organs is said to be manifest, for the root anj conveys that sense; but this Immutable is the opposite of that and is endowed with alifications that are spoken of by the great ones; those again, who meditate on that-; tesam, of them, among the two (groups); ke, who; are the yoga-vit-tamah, best experiencers of yoga, i.e., who are those that are surpassingly versed in yoga?
But leave alone those who meditate on the Immutable, who are fully enlightened and are free from desires. Whatever has to be said with regard to them, we shall say later on. As for those others-
12.10 If thou art unable to practise even this Abhyasa Yoga, be thou intent on doing actions for My sake; even by doing actions for My sake, thou shalt attain perfection.
12.10 And if thou are not strong enough to practise concentration, then devote thyself to My service, do all thine acts for My sake, and thou shalt still attain the goal.
12.10. If you are incapable of doing a [steady] practice, then have, your chief aim, of performing actions for Me.  Even by performing actions for Me, You shall attain success.
12.10 If you  are incapable of even this practice of repetition, then devote yourself to My deeds (service). For even by working for My sake, you will attain perfection.
12.10 If you are unable even to practise, be intent on works for Me. By undertaking works for Me as well, you will attain perfection. [Identity with Brahman.]
12.10 If you are incapable of practising remembrance in the above manner, then devote yourself to 'My deeds.' Such devotional acts consist in the construction of temples, laying out temple gardens, lighting up lamps therein, sweeping, sprinkling water and plastering the floor of holy shrines, gathering flowers, engaging in My worship, chanting My names, circumambulating My temples, praising Me, prostrating before Me etc. Do these with great affection. Even performing such works which are exceedingly dear to Me, you will, before long, get your mind steadily focused on Me as through the practice of repetitions, and will gain perfection through attaining Me.
12.10 Abhyase'pi  etc.  The constant practice too becomes impossible due to the  predominance of the obstacles etc.  In that case, in order to eradicate them,  you should perform actions like worship, repetition  [of the Lord's name etc.],  recitation [of scriptures], offering oblations, etc.
12.10 If asamarthah asi, you are unable; api, even; abhyase, to practise; then, bhava, be; mat-karma-paramah, intent on works for Me-works (karma) meant for Me (mat) are mat-karma-i.e., you be such that works meant for Me become most important to you. In the absence of Practice, api, even; kurvan, by undertaking; karmani, works alone; madartham, for Me; avapsyasi, you will attain; siddhim, perfection-by gradually aciring purification of mind, concentration and Knowledge.
12.11 If thou art unable to do even this, then, resorting to union with Me, renounce the fruits of all actions with the self controlled.
12.11 And if thou art too weak even for this, then seek refuge in union with Me, and with perfect self-control renounce the fruit of thy action.
12.11. Now, if you are not capable of doing this too, then taking resort to My Yoga renounce the fruit of all action, with your self (mind) subdued.
12.11 If you are unable to do even this, i.e., taking refuge in My Yoga, then, with your self controlled, renounce the fruits of every action.
12.11 If you are unable to do even this, in that case, having resorted to the Yoga for Me, thereafter renounce the results of all works by becoming controlled in mind.
12.11 If you are unable to do even this 'taking refuge in My Yoga,' i.e., if you are unable even to do actions for My sake, which forms the sprout of Bhakti Yoga, wherein through meditation I am made the exclusive and sole object of love - then you should resort to Aksara Yoga described in the first six chapters. It consists in contemplation on the nature of the individual self. This engenders devotion to the Lord. As a means for practice of this (Aksara Yoga), renounce the fruit of every action.

The state of mind that holds Me as the only worthy object of attainment and love arises only when all the sins of an aspirant are destroyed without exception. 'One with a controlled mind' means one with the mind subdued. When the individual self is visualised to be of the nature of a Sesa (subsidiary) to the Lord, and when the veil of nescience consisting in identifying the self with the body is removed by contemplation on the self generated through the performance of works without attachment to the fruits and with My propitiation as the sole objective - then supreme Bhakti to Me will originate by itself. [The point driven home is this:  It is nescience that stands between the Jiva and the Lord. This nescience consists in identification of the self with the body. It is through works done without an eye on their fruits but exclusively as an offering to the Lord, that this nescience is removed. Thus Karma Yoga is the sprout of self-realisation, and of Bhakti. On the nescience being removed, the knowledge that one (i.e., the Jiva) is a Sesa (an absolutely dependent liege) of the Lord, dawns on the Jiva. Such knowledge generates exclusive devotion or Bhakti accompanied by Prapatti. Or if the Jiva gets immersed in Its own bliss, It will attain Kaivalya.]

In the same manner, Sri Krsna will further show in the text beginning with 'By worshipping Him with his work will a man reach perfection' (18.46) and ending with 'Forsaking the feeling of "I" and with no feeling of "mine" and tranil, one becomes worthy of the state of Brahman. Having realised the state of Brahman, tranil, he neither grieves nor craves. Regarding all beings alike, he attains supreme devotion to Me' (18.53-54).
12.11 Atha etc.  In case due to ignorance, you do not know the method, enjoined in the scriptures and hence you are not able to perform actions for the Lord, then renounce  (dedicate) all that to Me, through offering your own self  [to Me].  This is the intention  [here].  Holding the same intention, I have myself declared in the Laghuprakriya as :
 
'Whatever action I have done, whether it is incomplete or superfluous,  not properly understood, bereft of a  proper order of precedence, devoid of  [good] care, and full of slip of intellect;
 
O Lord of All !  Please, with mercy forgive all these of me, the afflicted and foolish devotee of Yours; for you are compassionate;
 
With this prayer-Yoga,  I offer myself to You  [so that]  I do not become a receptacle of miseries again unnecessarily.'
 
the same idea may be observed in the scriptural texts of  the  Siddhanta  [system] - that have the Supreme Lord as their subject matter - while they  speak of offering oneself  [to the Lord].								
 The same purport is summed up -
12.11 Atha, if, again; asaktah asi, you are unable; kartum, to do; etat api, even this-what was stated as being 'intent on doing works for Me'; in that case, mad-yogam-asritah, having resorted to the Yoga for Me-the performance of those works that are being done by dedicating them to Me is madyogah; by resorting to that Yoga for Me; tatah, thereafter; sarva-karma-phala-tyagam kuru, renounce, give up, the results of all works; by becoming yata-atmavan, controlled in mind. [In the earlier verse it was enjoined that all works, be they Vedic or secular, are to be considered as belonging to God and should be done for Him-not for oneself-, as a soldier would do for his king. In the present verse it is stated that the attitude should be, 'May this work of mine please God.' This very attitude involves dedicating of results to God. See S.
According to M.S., mat-karma in the earlier verse means bhagavata-dharma, i.e. hearing, singing, etc. about God. In the present verse, sarva-karma means all works in general.-Tr.]
Now the Lord praises the renunciation of the results of all works:
12.12 Better indeed is knowledge than practice; than knowledge meditation is better; than meditation the renunciation of the fruits of actions: peace immediately follows renunciation.
12.12 Knowledge is superior to blind action, meditation to mere knowledge, renunciation of the fruit of action to meditation, and where there is renunciation peace will follow.
12.12. For, knowledge is superior to practice; because of knowledge, meditation becomes pre-eminent; from meditation issues the renunciation of fruits of actions; and to renunciation, peace remains next.
12.12 Far better is knowledge of the self then the repeated practice (of remembrance of the Lord). Better is meditation than this knowledge; Better is renunciation of fruits of action than meditation. From such renunciation, peace ensues.
12.12 Knowledge is surely superior to practice; meditation surpasses knowledge. The renunciation of the results of works (excels) meditation. From renunciation, Peace follows immediately.
12.12 More than the practice of remembrance (of the Lord), which is difficult in the absence of love for the Lord, the direct knowledge of the self, arising from the contemplation of the imperishable self (Aksara), is conducive to the well-being of the self. Better than the imperfect knowledge of the self, is perfect meditation on the self, as it is more conducive to the well-being of the self. More conducive than imperfect meditation (i.e., meditation unaccompanied with renunciation), is the activity performed with renunciation of the fruits.

It is only after the annihilation of sins, through the performance of works accompanied by renounciation of fruits, that peace of mind is attained. When the mind is at peace, perfect meditation on the self is possible. From meditation results the direct realisation of the self. From the direct realisation of the self results supreme devotion. It is in this way that Atmanistha or devotion to the individual self becomes useful for a person who is incapable of practising loving devotion to the Supreme Being. And for one practising the discipline for attaining the self (Jnana Yoga) without acisition of perfect tranillity of mind, disinterested activity (Karma Yoga), including in it meditation on the self, is the better path for the knowledge of the self. [Thus the steps are performance of works without desire for fruits, eanimity of mind, meditation on the self, self-realisation, and devotion to the Lord.]

Now Sri Krsna enumerates the attributes reired of one intent on performance of disinterested activity:
12.12 Sreyah etc.   Knowledge in the form of entering into  [the Lord] is superior to practice;  for practice bears that result.  Due to the entering into the Lord, the meditation i.e.,  getting  absorbed  in the Bhagavat,  becomes pre-eminent i.e., attains superiority,  because of the achievement of what is desired.  When meditation i.e.,  getting absorbed in the Bhagavat is accomplished, then it is possible to renounce  fruits of actions.  Otherwise how can there be a renunciation in what is unknown ?  When renunciation of fruits of actions is achieved, there arises an uninterrupted peace.  Therefore, being the root of all  [these], the knowledge a'one, in the form of fixing the mind in  the Lord is important.
12.12 Jnanam, knowledge; [Firm conviction about the Self arrived at through Vedic texts and reasoning.] is hi, surely; sreyah, superior; -to what?-abhyasat, to practice [Practice-repeated effort to ascertain the true meaning of Vedic texts, in order to acire knowledge.] which is not preceded by discrimination. Dhyanam, meditation, undertaken along with knowledge; visisyate, surpasses even jnanat, that knowledge. Karma-phala-tyagah, renunciation of the results of works; excels even dhyanat, meditation associated with knowledge. ('Excels' has to be supplied.) Tyagat, from this renunciation of the results of actions, in the way described before; [By dedicating all actions to God with the idea, 'May God be pleased.'] santih, Peace, the cessation of transmigratory existence together with its cause; follows anantaram, immediately; not that it awaits another accasion.
Should the unenlightened person engaged in works be unable to practise the disciplines enjoined earlier, then, for him has been enjoined renunciation of the results of all works as a means to Liberation. But this has not been done at the very beginning. And for this reason renunciation of the results of all works has been praised in, 'Knowledge is surely superior to practice,' etc. by teaching about the successive excellence. For it has been taught as being fit to be adopted by one in case he is unable to practise the disciplines already presented [Presented from verse 3 onwards.]
Objection: From what similarly does the eulogy follow?
Reply: In the verse, 'When all desires clinging to one's heart fall off' (Ka, 2.3.14), it has been stated that Immortality results from the rejection of all desires. That is well known. And 'all desires' means the 'result of all rites and duties enjoined in the Vedas and Smrtis'. From the renunciation of these, Peace surely comes immediately to the enlightened man who is steadfast in Knowledge.
There is a similarity between renunciation of all desires and renunciation of the results of actions by an unenlightened person. Hence, on account of that similarity this eulogy of renunciation of the results of all actions is meant for rousing interest. As for instance, by saying that the sea was drunk up by the Brahmana Agastya, the Brahmanas of the present day are also praised owing to the similarity of Brahminhood. In this way it was been said that Karma-yoga becomes a means for Liberation,since it involves renunciaton of the rewards of works.
Here, again, the Yoga consisting in the concentration of mind on God as the Cosmic Person, as also the performance of actions etc. for God, have been spoken of by assuming a difference between God and Self. In, 'If you are unable to do even this' (11) since it has been hinted that it (Karma-yoga) is an effect of ignorance, therefore the Lord is pointing out that Karma-yoga is not suitable for the meditator on the Immutable, who is aware of idenity (of the Self with God). The Lord is similarly pointing out the impossibility of a karma-yogin's meditation on the Immutable.
In (the verse), 'they৷৷.attain Me alone' (4), having declared that those who meditate on the Immutable are independent so far as the attainment of Liberation is concerned, the Lord has shown in, '৷৷.I become the Deliverer' (7), that others have no independence; they are dependent on God. For, if they (the former) be considered to have become identified with God, they would be the same as the Immutable on account of (their) having realized non-difference. Conseently, speaking of them as objects of the act of deliverance will become inappropriate!
And, since the Lord in surely the greatest well-wisher of Arjuna, He imparts instructions only about Karma-yoga, which involves perception of duality and is not associated with full Illumination. Also, no one who has realized his Self as God through valid means of knowledge would like subordination to another, since it involves a contradiction. Therefore, with the idea, 'I shall speak of the group of virtues (as stated in), "He hwo is not hateful towards any creature," etc. which are the direct means to Immortality, to those monks who meditate on the Immutable,who are steadfast in full enlightenment and have given up all desires,' the Lord proceeds:
12.13 He who hates no creature, who is friendly and compassionate to all, who is free from attachment and egoism, balanced in pleasure and pain, and forgiving.
12.13 He who is incapable of hatred towards any being, who is kind and compassionate, free from selfishness, without pride, equable in pleasure and in pain, and forgiving,
12.13. He, who is not a hater, [but] only a compassionate friend of every being; who is free from the sense of  'mine, 	 and the sense of  'I';  who is even minded in pain and pleasure and is endowed with forbearance;
12.13 He who never hates any being, who is friendly and compassionate, who is free from the feelings of I and mine, who looks upon all pain and pleasure the same as and who is enduring;
12.13 He who is not hateful towards any creature, who is friendly and compassionate, who has no idea of 'mine' and the idea of egoism, who is the same under sorrow and happiness, who is forgiving;
12.13 - 12.14 In these and succeeding verses the Lord mentions the nature of the Karma Yogi who adores Him through his works. In other words the Bhakti element in Karma Yoga is emphasised. He never hates any being even though they hate him and do him wrong. For he thinks that the Lord impels these beings to hate him and do him wrong for atoning for his transgressions. He is 'friendly', evincing a friendly disposition towards all beings whether they hate him or do him wrong. He is 'compassionate', evincing compassion towards their sufferings. He is free from the 'feeling of mine,' i.e., he is not possessive with regard to his body, senses and all things associated with them. He is free from the feeling of 'I', i.e., is free from the delusion that his body is the self. Therefore, 'pain and pleasure are the same to him,' i.e., he is free from distress and delight resulting from pain and pleasure arising from his deeds. He is 'enduring', unaffected even by those two (i.e., pleasure and pain) due to the inevitable contact of sense-objects. He is 'content', namely, satisfied with whatever chance may bring him for the sustenance of his body. He 'ever meditates,' i.e., is constantly intent on contemplating on the self as separate from the body. He is 'self-restrained', namely, he controls the activities of his mind. He is of 'firm conviction' regarding the meanings taught in the science of the self. His 'mind and reason are dedicated to Me' i.e., his mind and reason are dedicated to Me in the form 'Bhagavan Vasudeva alone is propitiated by disinterested activities, and when duly propitiated, He wil bring about for me the direct vision of the self.' Such a devotee of mine, i.e., who works in this manner as a Karma Yogin, is dear to Me.
12.13 See Comment under 12.14
12.13 Advesta, he who is not hateful; sarva-bhutanam, towards any creature: He does not feel repulsion for anything, even for what may be the cause of sorrow to himself, for he sees all beings as his own Self. Maitrah, he who is friendly-behaving like a friend; karunah eva ca, and compassionate: karuna is kindness, compassion towards sorrow-stricken creatures; one possessing that is karunah, i.e. a monk, who grants safety to all creatures. Nirmamah, he who has no idea of 'mine'; nirahankarah, who has no idea of egoism; sama-duhkha-sukhah, who is the same under sorrow and happiness, he in whom sorrow and happiness do not arouse any repulsion or attraction; ksami, who is forgiving, who remains unperturbed even when abused or assaulted;
12.14 Ever content, steady in meditation, self-controlled, possessed of firm conviction, with the mind and intellect dedicated to Me, he, My devtoee, is dear to Me.
12.14 Always contented, self-centred, self-controlled, resolute, with mind and reason dedicated to Me, such a devotee of Mine is My beloved.
12.14. Who remains well-content and is a man of  Yoga at all times; who is self-controlled and is firmly resolute; and who has offered to Me his mind and intellect-that devotee of Mine is dear to Me.
12.14 He who is content, who ever meditates and is self-restrained and who is firm in his convictions, who has his mind and reason dedicated to Me - he is dear to Me.
12.14 He who is ever content, who is a yogi, who has self-control, who has firm conviction, who has dedicated his mind and intellect to Me-he who is such a devotee of Mine is dear to Me.
12.13 - 12.14 In these and succeeding verses the Lord mentions the nature of the Karma Yogi who adores Him through his works. In other words the Bhakti element in Karma Yoga is emphasised. He never hates any being even though they hate him and do him wrong. For he thinks that the Lord impels these beings to hate him and do him wrong for atoning for his transgressions.

Such a devotee of mine, i.e., who works in this manner as a Karma Yogin, is dear to Me.
12.13-14 Advesta  etc.  Santustah etc.  [Friend] :  he who has friend-liness  (or goodwill)  i.e. unselfishness.  In the same manner  'compassionate'  [is  to be interpreted].  'These are mine'  etc., is the sence of  'mine'  (or sense of possessiveness);  'I am generous',  'I am powerful',   'I am victorious' etc., is the sense of  'I'  (or egotism).  In whom these two are absent that man is free from the senses of  'mine'   and  of  'I'.  Forbearance :  a thought  that entertains no enmity even towards an enemy who has  [actually] injured.  A man of Yoga at all times :  because his internal organ remains  completely iet even at the stage of his mundane dealings.
12.14 Santustah satatam, he who is ever content: who has the sense of contentment irrespective of getting or not getting what is needed for the maintenance of the body; who is similarly ever-satisfied whether he gets or not a good thing. Yogi, who is a yogi, a man of concentrated mind; yata-atma, who has self-control, whose body and organs are under control; drdha-niscayah, who has firm conviction-with regard to the reality of the Self; arpita-mano-buddhih, who has dedicated his mind and intellect; mayi, to Me-(i.e.) a monk whose mind (having hte characteristics of reflection) and intellect (possessed of the faculty of taking decisions) are dedicated to, fixed on, Me alone; sah yah, he who is; such a modbhaktah, devotee of Mine; is priyah, dear; me, to Me. It was hinted in the Seventh Chapter, 'For I am very much dear to the man of Knowledge, and he too is dear to Me' (7.17). That is being elaborated here.
12.15 He by whom the world is not agitated and who cannot be agitated by the world, and who is freed from joy, anger, fear and anxiety  he is dear to Me.
12.15 He who does not harm the world, and whom the world cannot harm, who is not carried away by any impulse of joy, anger or fear, such a one is My beloved.
12.15. He, on account of whom the world does not get agitated; who too does not feel agitated on account of  the world; who is free from joy and  impatience, fear and anxiety-he is dear to Me.
12.15 He from whom the world has no cause to be frightened, who is not frightened by the world, who is free from joy and impatience, fear and repulsion - he is dear to me.
12.15 He, too, owing to whom the world is not disturbed, and who is not disturbed by the world, who is free from joy, impatience, fear and anxiety, is dear to Me.
12.15 That person who is engaged in Karma Yoga does not become the cause of 'fear to the world'; he does nothing to cause fear to the world. He has no cause to 'fear the world,' i.e., no action on the part of others can cause him fear because of the certainty that he is not inimical to the world. Therefore he is not in the habit of showing favour towards someone and intolerance towards others; he has no fear of some or repulsion for others. Such a person is dear to Me.
12.15 See Comment under 12.20
12.15 Sah ca, he too; yasmat, owing to whom owing to which monk; lokah, the world; na udvijate, is not disturbed, not afflicted, not agitated; so also, yah na udvijate, he who is not disturbed; lokat, by the world; muktah, who is free; harsa-amarsa-bhaya-udvegaih, from joy, impatience, fear and anxiety;-harsa is elation of the mind on aciring a thing dear to oneself, and is manifested as horripillation, shedding of tears, etc.; amarsa is non-forbearance; bhaya is fright; udvega is distress; he who is free from them-, is priyah, dear; me, to Me.

Further,
12.17 He who neither rejoices, nor hates, nor grieves, nor desires, renouncing good and evil, and who is full of devotion, is dear to Me.
12.17 He who is beyond joy and hate, who neither laments nor desires, to whom good and evil fortunes are the same, such a one is My beloved.

a devotee.
12.17 He who does not rejoice, does not fret, does not lament, does not hanker; who gives up good and bad, who is filled with devotion-he is dear to Me.
12.17 He who does not 'rejoice', i.e., that Karma Yogin, who, on obtaining things which cause joy to man, does not rejoice; who does not 'hate', does not hate on obtaining anything undesriable; who is not 'grieved' by common sorrows which cause grief among men, as the loss of wife, son, fortune etc.; who 'does not desire' anything like wife, son, fortune etc.; not already acired by him; who 'renounces good and evil,' i.e., who renounces both merit and demerit because, like demert, merit also causes bondage, there being no difference between them in this respect - he who is like this and devoted to Me is dear to Me.
12.17 See Comment under 12.20
12.17 Yah, he who; na hrsyati, does not rejoice on getting a coveted object; na dvesti, does not fret on getting an undesirable object; na socati, does not lament on the loss of a dear one; and na kanksati, does not hanker after an object not acired; subha-asubha-parityogi, who gives up good and bad, who is apt to give up good and bad actions; bhaktiman, who is full of devotion-he is dear to Me.
12.19 He to whom censure and praise are eal, who is silent, content with anything, homeless, of a steady mind, and full of devotion  that man is dear to Me.
12.19 Who is indifferent to praise and censure, who enjoys silence, who is contented with every fate, who has no fixed abode, who is steadfast in mind, and filled with devotion, such a one is My beloved.
12.19. To whom blame and praise are eal; who is silent (does not over-speak) and is well content with one thing or other [that comes to him]; who has no fixed thought [in the mundane life]; who is [yet] steady-minded [in spiritual practice]  and is full of devotion-that man is dear to Me.

12.19 The person to whom denunciation and praise are the same, who is silent, content with anything, homeless, steady-minded, and full of devotion is dear to Me.
12.18 - 12.19 The absence of hate etc., towards foes, friends etc., has already been taught in the stanza beginning with, 'He who never hates any being' (11.13). What is now taught is that eanimity to be practised even when such persons mentioned above are present before one who is superior to those having a general eanimous temperament referred to earlier. Who has no 'home', namely, who is not attached to home, etc., as he possesses firmness of mind with regard to the self. Because of this, he is 'same even in honour and dishonour.' He who is devoted to Me and who is like this - he is dear to Me.

Showing the superiority of Bhakti-Nistha over Atma-nistha, Sri Krsna now concludes in accordance with what is stated at the beginning of this chapter in Verse 2.
12.19 See Comment under 12.20
12.19 Narah, the person; tulya-ninda-stutih, to whom denunciation and praise are the same; mauni, who is silent, restrained in speech; santustah, content; yena-kenacit, with anything-for the mere maintenance of the body, as has been said in, 'The gods know him to be a Brahmana who is clad by anyone whosoever' (Mbh. Sa. 245.12); further, aniketah, he who is homeless, who has no fixed place of residence-'without a home' [ The whole verse is 'He,however is certainly the knower of Liberation who has attachment neither for a hut, nor for water, nor cloth, nor the three places of pilgrimage, nor a home, nor a seat, nor food.'], as said in another Smrti; sthira-matih, steady-minded, whose thought is steady with regard to the Reality which is the supreme Goal; and bhaktiman, who is full of devotion-(he) is dear to Me. [There is a repeated mention of Bhakti in this Chapter because it is means to the Knowledge which leads to the supreme Goal.]
 
The group of alities of the monks who meditate on the Immutable, who have renounced all desires, who are steadfast in the knowledge of the supreme Goal-which (alities) are under discussion beginning from 'He who is not hateful towards any creature' (13), is being concluded:
12.2 The Blessed Lord said  Those who, fixing their mind on Me, worship Me, ever steadfast and endowed with supreme faith, are the best in Yoga in My opinion.
12.2 Lord Shri Krishna replied: Those who keep their minds fixed on Me, who worship Me always with unwavering faith and concentration; these are the very best.
12.2. The Bhagavat said  Those, who, causing their mind to enter well into Me, and being permanently attached [to Me], and endowed with an extraordinary faith, worship Me - they are considered by Me to be the best among the masters of  Yoga.
12.2 The Lord said  Those who, ever integrated with Me and possessed of supreme faith, worship Me, focusing their minds on Me - these are considered by Me the highest among the Yogins.
12.2 The Blessed Lord said  Those who meditate on Me by fixing their minds on Me with steadfast devotion (and) being endowed with supreme faith-they are considered to be the most perfect yogis according to Me.
12.2 The Lord said  I consider them to be the highest among the Yogins (i.e., among those striving for realisation) - them who worship Me focusing their minds upon Me as one exceedingly dear to them, who are endowed with supreme faith, and who are ever 'integrated' with Me, namely ever desirous of constant union with Me. Those who thus worship Me, focusing their minds on Me as their supreme goal, attain Me soon and easily. Such is the meaning.
12.2 Mayi etc.  Those are considered by Me to be the best among the masters of Yoga,  whose act of entering into  (fixing the mind in)  the Supreme  Lordship is a spontaneous  (unartificial)  act of  becoming  one with Him.  By this  [statement] a solemn declaration is made  [by the Lord].
12.2 Ye, those who, being devotees; upasate, meditate; mam, on Me, the supreme Lord of all the masters of yoga, the Omniscient One whose vision is free from purblindness caused by such defects as attachment etc.; avesya,by fixing, concentrating; their manah, minds; mayi, on Me, on God in His Cosmic form; nitya-yuktah, with steadfast devotion, by being ever-dedicated in accordance with the idea expressed in the last verse of the preceding chapter; and being upetah, endowed; paraya, with supreme; sraddhaya faith;-te, they; matah, are considered; to be yukta-tamah, most perfect yogis; me, according to Me, for they spend days and nights with their minds constantly fixed on Me. Therefore, it is proper to say with regard to them that they are the best yogis.
'Is it that the others do not become the best yogis?'
No, but listen to what has to be said as regards them:'
12.20 They verily who follow this immortal Dharma (law or doctrine) as described above, endowed with faith, regarding Me as their supreme goal, they, the devotees, are exceedingly dear to Me.
12.20 Verily those who love the spiritual wisdom as I have taught, whose faith never fails, and who concentrate their whole nature on Me, they indeed are My most beloved."
12.20. Those, who resort, as instructed above, to this duty [conducive to]  immortality, who have faith [in it] and have Me alone their goal - those devotees are exceedingly dear to Me.
12.20 But those devotees who follow this nectar of virtuous-duty as taught above, who are full of faith and who regard Me as the Supreme - they are exceedingly dear to Me.
12.20 But [Tu (but) is used to distinguish those who have attained the highest Goal from the aspirants.-Tr.] those devotees who accept Me as the supreme Goal, and with faith seek for this ambrosia [M.S.'s reading is dharmamrtam-nectar in the form of virtue. Virtue is called nectar because it leads to Immortality, or because it is sweet like nectar.] which is indistinguishable from the virtues as stated above, they are very dear to Me.
12.20 But those who follow Bhakti Yoga - 'which is a nectar of virtuous duty,' i.e., which is at once virtuous duty and nectar, and which even as a menas, is eal to its end in conferring bliss on those who follow is as stated above, i.e., in the manner taught in the stanza beginning with 'Those who, focusing their minds on Me' (12.2) - such devotees are exceedingly dear to Me.
12.15-20  Yasmat  etc. upto  Me priyah.   One who has no fixed thought :  One who has no resolution,  [in his mundane life] like  'This alone must be done by me'.  He, who enjoys, with contentment, both pleasure and pain as they come, and has his mind completely absorbed in Supreme Lord - that person happily (or easily)  attains the Supreme Isolation (Emancipation)
12.20 Tu, but; ye bhaktah, those devotees of Mine, the monks who have resorted to the highest devotion consisting in the knowledge of the supreme Reality; mat-paramah, who accept Me as the supreme Goal, to whom I, as mentioned above, who am identical with the Immutable, am the highest (parama), unsurpassable Goal; and sraddadhanah, with faith; paryupasate, seek for, practise; idam, this; dharmyamrtam, ambrosia that is indistinguishable from the virtues-that which is indistinguishable from dharma (virtue) is dharmya, and this is called amrta (ambrosia) since it leads to Immortality-; yatha-uktam, as stated above in, 'He who is not hateful towards any creature,' etc.; te, they; are ativa, very; priyah, dear; me, to Me.
After having explained what was hinted in, 'For I am very much dear to the man of Knowledge৷৷.'(7.17), that has been concluded here in, 'Those devotees are very dear to Me.'
Since by seeking for this ambrosia which is indistinguishable from the virtues as stated above one becomes very dear to Me, who am theLord Vishnu, the supreme God, therefore this nectar which is indistinguishable from the virtues has to be diligently sought for by one who is a seeker of Liberation, who wants to attain the coveted Abode of Visnu. This is the purport of the sentence. [Thus, after the consummation of meditation on the alified Brahman, one who aspires after the unalified Brahman, who has the alifications mentioned in, 'He who is not hateful towards any creature,' etc., who is pre-eminently fit for this purpose, and who practises sravana etc. has the possibility of realizing the Truth from which his Liberation logically follows. Hence, the conclusion is that the meaning of the word tat (in the sentence tattvamasi) has to be sought for, since his has the power to arouse the comprehension of the meaning of that sentence, which is the means to Liberation.]
12.4 Having restrained all the senses, even-minded everywhere, intent on the welfare of all beings  verily they also come unto Me.
12.4 Subduing their senses, viewing all conditions of life with the same eye, and working for the welfare of all beings, assuredly they come to Me.
12.4. Who, by restraining properly the group of sense-organs have eanimity at all stages, and find pleasure in the welfare of all beings - they attain nothing but Me.
12.4 Having subdued all the senses, being even-minded, engaged in the welfare of all beings - they too come to Me only.
12.4 By fully controlling all the organs and always being even-minded, they, engaged in the welfare of all beings, attain Me alone.
12.3 - 12.5 The individual self meditated upon by those who follow the path of the 'Aksara' (the Imperishable) is thus described:  It cannot be 'defined' in terms indicated by expressions like gods and men etc., for It is different from the body; It is 'imperceptible' through the senses such as eyes; It is 'omnipresent and unthinkable,' for though It exists everywhere in bodies such as those of gods and others, It cannot be conceived in terms of those bodies, as It is an entity of an altogether different kind; It is 'common to all beings' i.e., alike in all beings but different from the bodily forms distinguishing them; It is 'immovable' as It does not move out of Its unie nature, being unmodifiable, and therefore eternal. Such aspirants are further described as those who, 'subduing their senses' like the eye from their natural operations, look upon all beings of different forms as 'eal' by virtue of their knowledge of the sameness of the nature of the selves as knowers in all. Therefore they are not given 'to take pleasure in the misfortune of others,' as such feelings proceed from one's identification with one's own special bodily form.

Those who meditate on the Imperishable Principle (individual self) in this way, even they come to Me. It means that they also realise their essential self, which, in respect of freedom from Samsara, is like My own Self. So Sri Krsna will declare later on:  'Partaking of My nature' (14.2). Also the Sruti says:  'Untainted, he attains supreme eality' (Mun. U., 3.1.3).

Likewise He will declare the Supreme Brahman as being distinct from the freed self which is without modification and is denoted by the term 'Imperishable' (Aksara), and is described as unchanging (Kutastha). 'The Highest Person is other than this Imperishable' (15.16 - 17). But in the teaching in Aksara-vidya 'Now that higher science by which that Aksara is known' (Mun. U., 1.5) the entity that is designated by the term Aksara is Supreme Brahman Himself; for He is the source of all beings, etc. Greater is the difficulty of those whose minds are attached to the unmanifest. The path of the unmanifest is a psychosis of the mind with the unmanifest as its object. It is accomplished with difficulty by embodied beings, who have misconceived the body as the self. For, embodied beings mistake the body for the self.

The superiority of those who adore the Supreme Being is now stated clearly:
12.4 See Comment under 12.5
12.4 Samniyamya, by fully controlling, withdrawing; indriya-gramam, all the organs; and sarvatra, always at all times; sama-buddhayah, being even-minded-the even-minded are those whose minds remain eipoised in getting anything desirable or undesirable; te, they, those who are of this kind; ratah, engaged; sarva-bhuta-hite, in the welfare of all beings prapnuvanti, attain; mam, Me; eva, alone. As regards them it needs no saying that they attain Me, for it has been said, '৷৷.but the man of Knowledge is the very Self. (This is) My opinion' (7.18). It is certainly not proper to speak of being or not being the best among the yogis with regard to those who have attained identity with the Lord.
But,
12.5 Greater is their trouble whose minds are set on the unmanifested; for the goal; the unmanifested, is very hard for the embodied to reach.
12.5 But they who thus fix their attention on the Absolute and Impersonal encounter greater hardships, for it is difficult for those who possess a body to realise Me as without one.
12.5. (But) the trouble is much more for them, who have their mind fixed on the Unmanifest; for the Unmanifest-goal is attained with difficulty by men, bearing body.
12.5 Greater is the difficulty of those whose minds are thus attached to the unmanifest. For the way of the unmanifest is hard to reach by embodied beings.
12.5 For them who have their minds attached to the Unmanifested the struggle is greater; for, the Goal which is the Unmanifest is attained with difficulty by the embodied ones.
12.3 - 12.5 The individual self meditated upon by those who follow the path of the 'Aksara' (the Imperishable) is thus described:  It cannot be 'defined' in terms indicated by expressions like gods and men etc., for It is different from the body; It is 'imperceptible' through the senses such as eyes; It is 'omnipresent and unthinkable,' for though It exists everywhere in bodies such as those of gods and others, It cannot be conceived in terms of those bodies, as It is an entity of an altogether different kind; It is 'common to all beings' i.e., alike in all beings but different from the bodily forms distinguishing them; It is 'immovable' as It does not move out of Its unie nature, being unmodifiable, and therefore eternal. Such aspirants are further described as those who, 'subduing their senses' like the eye from their natural operations, look upon all beings of different forms as 'eal' by virtue of their knowledge of the sameness of the nature of the selves as knowers in all. Therefore they are not given 'to take pleasure in the misfortune of others,' as such feelings proceed from one's identification with one's own special bodily form.

Those who meditate on the Imperishable Principle (individual self) in this way, even they come to Me. It means that they also realise their essential self, which, in respect of freedom from Samsara, is like My own Self. So Sri Krsna will declare later on:  'Partaking of My nature' (14.2). Also the Sruti says:  'Untainted, he attains supreme eality' (Mun. U., 3.1.3).

Likewise He will declare the Supreme Brahman as being distinct from the freed self which is without modification and is denoted by the term 'Imperishable' (Aksara), and is described as unchanging (Kutastha). 'The Highest Person is other than this Imperishable' (15.16 - 17). But in the teaching in Aksara-vidya 'Now that higher science by which that Aksara is known' (Mun. U., 1.5) the entity that is designated by the term Aksara is Supreme Brahman Himself; for He is the source of all beings, etc. Greater is the difficulty of those whose minds are attached to the unmanifest. The path of the unmanifest is a psychosis of the mind with the unmanifest as its object. It is accomplished with difficulty by embodied beings, who have misconceived the body as the self. For, embodied beings mistake the body for the self.

The superiority of those who adore the Supreme Being is now stated clearly:
12.3-5 Ye tu etc. upto avapyate.  On the other hand, those, who contemplate on the Self as the motionless Brahman - by them also all the attributes of Absolute  Lord are superimposed on the Self - the attributes that are indicated by the adjectives  'omni-present'  etc.  Therefore even the contemplators  of the  [attributeless]  Brahman  reach nothing but Me, of course.  However, the trouble they undergo, is much more.  For, they [first]  superimposed  on  the Self the actonary of attributes like absence-of-sin etc., and then comtemplate on It.  Thus, while without any effort  [on the part of the contemplator]  the Lord is readily available with the greatness due to the  host of self-accomplished attributes, these persons undergo two-fold trouble.
12.5 Tesam, for them; avyakta-asakta-cetasam, who have their minds attached to the Unmanifest; klesah,the struggle; is adhika-tarah, greater. Although the trouble is certainly great for those who are engaged in works etc. for Me, still owing to the need of giving up self-identification with the body, it is greater in the case of those who accept the Immutable as the Self and who kept in view the supreme Reality. Hi, for; avyakta gatih, the Goal which is the Unmanifest-(the goal) which stands in the form of the Immutable; that is avapyate, attained; duhkham, with difficulty; dehavadbhih, by the embodied ones, by those who identify themselves with the body. Hence the struggle is greater.
We shall speak later of the conduct of those who meditate on the Unmanifest.
12.6 But to those who worship Me, renouncing all actions in Me, regarding Me as the supreme gaol, meditating on Me with single-minded Yoga.
12.6 Verily, those who surrender their actions to Me, who muse on Me, worship Me and meditate on Me alone, with no thought save of Me,
12.6. On the other hand, those who, having renounced all their actions in Me, have Me [alone] their goal; and revere Me, meditating on Me by that Yoga alone, which admits no other element but Me in it;
12.6 For, those who dedicate all actions to Me, hold Me as their supreme goal, intent on Me, and worship Me meditating on Me with exclusive devotion;
12.6 As for those who, having dedicated all actions to Me and accepted Me as the supreme, meditate by thinking of Me with single-minded concentration only-.
12.6 - 12.7 But those who, with a mind 'focused on Me,' the Supreme Self, and 'intent upon Me,' namely, holding Me as their sole object, dedicating to Me all their actions - i.e., including all worldly actions like eating which are meant for supporting the body, as also Vedic rites like sacrifices, gifts, fire-offerings, austerities etc., generally done by worldly-minded people for other purposes - worship Me and meditate on Me with exclusive devotion, namely, with devotion without any other purpose, adoring Me by all such acts as meditation, worship, prostration, praises and hymns which are by themselves exceedingly dear to them and are eal to the end itself - to these I become soon their saviour from the sea of Samsara which, on account of its being antagonistic to the attainment of Myself, is deadly.
12.6 See Comment under 12.8
12.6 Tu, as for; ye, those who; sannyasya, having dedicated; sarvani, all; karmani, actions; mayi, to Me who am God; and matparah, having accepted Me as the supreme; upasate, meditate; dhyayantah, by thinking; mam, of Me; ananyena, with single-minded; yogena, concentration; eva, only-. That (yoga) is single-minded which has no other object than the Cosmic Deity, the Self. By thinking exclusively with that single-minded [The Ast. and the A.A. read 'kena, what?' in place of 'kevalena, exclusively'.-Tr.] (yoga)-.
What comes to them?
12.7 To those whose minds are set on Me, O Arjuna, verily I become ere long the saviour out of the ocean of Samsara.
12.7 O Arjuna! I rescue them from the ocean of life and death, for their minds are fixed on Me.
12.7. Of them, having  their mind completely entered in Me, I become, before long, a redeemer from the ocean of  the death-cycle, O son of Prtha !
12.7 Of those whose minds are thus focused on Me, I become soon their saviour from the ocean of mortal life.
12.7 O son of Prtha, for them who have their minds absorbed in Me, I become, without delay, the Deliverer from the sea of the world which is fraught with death.
12.6 - 12.7 But those who, with a mind 'focused on Me,' the Supreme Self, and 'intent upon Me,' namely, holding Me as their sole object, dedicating to Me all their actions - i.e., including all worldly actions like eating which are meant for supporting the body, as also Vedic rites like sacrifices, gifts, fire-offerings, austerities etc., generally done by worldly-minded people for other purposes - worship Me and meditate on Me with exclusive devotion, namely, with devotion without any other purpose, adoring Me by all such acts as meditation, worship, prostration, praises and hymns which are by themselves exceedingly dear to them and are eal to the end itself - to these I become soon their saviour from the sea of Samsara which, on account of its being antagonistic to the attainment of Myself, is deadly.
12.7 See Comment under 12.8
12.7 O son of Prtha, tesam, for them who are solely devoted to meditating on Me; avesita-cetasam mayi, who have their minds absorbed in, fixed on, merged in, Me who am the 
Cosmic Person; aham, I, God; bhavami, become; na cirat, without delay;-what then? soon indeed-the samuddharta, Deliverer-. Wherefrom? In answer the Lord says, mrtyu-samsara-sagarat, from the sea of the world which is fraught with death. Samsara (world) fraught with mrtyu (death) is mrtyu-samsara. That itself is like a sea, being difficult to cross. I become their deliverer from that sea of transmigration which is fraught with death.
Since this is so, therefore,
12.8 Fix thy mind in Me only, thy intellect in Me, (then) thou shalt no doubt live in Me alone hereafter.
12.8 Then let thy mind cling only to Me, let thy intellect abide in Me; and without doubt thou shalt live hereafter in Me alone.
12.8. [Hence], fix your mind on nothing but Me; cuase your taught to settle in Me.  Thus resorting to the best Yoga, you will dwell in Me alone.
12.8 Focus your mind on Me alone; and let your Buddhi enter into Me. Then, you will live in Me alone; there is no doubt.
12.8 Fix the mind on Me alone; in Me alone rest the intellect. There is no doubt that hereafter you will dwell in Me alone. [For the sake of metre, eva and atah (in the second line of the verse) are not joined together (to form evatah).]
12.8 'Focus your mind on Me alone,' on account of My being the unsurpassed end of human endeavour and on My being easily attainable without delay. Focus your mind in meditation on Me alone. Let your Buddhi 'enter into Me,' strengthened by the conviction that I alone am the supreme object to be attained. Then you will 'live in Me alone,' i.e., You will live in Me alone immediately after focusing your mind on Me by forming the conviction that I alone am the supreme object to be attained.
12.6-8 Ye tu etc. upto  asthitah.  Those who renounce all (all actions)  in Me according to the instruction related above - of  them I am the redeemer from all the afflictions like obstacles  [on the way to realisation] etc.  The act of causing the mind to enter [into the Supreme]  has been explained  (under  XII, 2 above).  Therefore, this alone is the highest form of Yoga, because it is natural.  Hence  [I have said] in my  Hymn :
 
'If, during  [one's]  concentration, reflecting with high esteem and remaining in a  [particular] posture,  and the best  process  (karana),  a person causes a certain awakening to shine forth, that is not the  Consciousness of Yours  (i.e. of the Goddess)  that rises up perennially and flows with its own  (unadulterated)  taste; for, here  (in the former) too the presence of the triad is distinctly felt.
 
On the other hand, when  [glowing] without fuel; holding to its independence; following horripilation,  [bodily]  shake and tears,  [all] breaking forth spontaneously; and clearly assuming the indifference  [even] to the body; the awakening fire of Consciousness suddely shines, on its own accord simultaneously; then alone, O Goddess, that body of Yours, the mightly  Lord (Mahesa) is realised - a body which is devoid of  [all]  supports, and which breaks the bondage of  the dependent.'
 
And so on.
12.8 Adhatsva, fix manah, the mind-possessed of the power of thinking and doubting; mayi, on Me, on God as the Cosmic Person; eva, alone. Mayi, in Me; eva, alone; nivesaya, rest; the buddhim, intellect, which engages in determining (things). Listen to what will happen to you thery: Na samsayah, there is no doubt-no doubt should be entertained with regard to this; that atah urdhvam, hereafter, after the fall of the body; nivasisyasi, you will dwell; mayi, in Me, live in identity withMe; eva, alone.
12.9 If thou art unable to fix thy mind steadily on Me, then by the Yoga of constant practice do thou seek to reach Me, O Arjuna.
12.9 But if thou canst not fix thy mind firmly on Me, then, My beloved friend, try to do so by constant practice.
12.9. In case you are not able to cause your mind to enter completley into Me, then, O Dhananjaya !  seek to attain Me by the practice-Yoga.
12.9 If now you are unable to focus your mind on Me, then seek to reach Me, O Arjuna, by the practice of repetition.
12.9 If, however, you are unable to establish the mind steadily on Me, then, O Dhananjaya, seek to attain Me through the Yoga of Practice.
12.9 Now, if you are unable to focus your mind immediately on Me in deep meditation, then seek to reach Me by the 'practice of repetition (Abhyasa Yoga)'. By the repeated practice of remembrance full of immense love, concentrate your mind on Me the ocean of manifold attributes innate to Me like, beauty, affability, friendliness, affection, compassion, sweetness, majesty, magnanimity, heroism, valour, might, omniscience, freedom from wants, unfailing resolves, sovereignty over all, being the cause of all etc., and being antagonistic to all that is evil. All these attributes are of unlimited excellence in the Supreme Person.
12.9 Atha etc.  to cause the mind [to enter into the Lord] is hard to achieve without the descent of the Lord's Grace with greater force, and without the favour of the revered preceptors, pleased [by services etc.]  for a considerable period of time.  Hence, practice [is prescribed].
12.9 Atha, if, however; na saknosi, you are unable; samadhatum, to establish, in this way as I have described; cittam, the mind; sthiram, steadily, unwaveringly; mayi, on Me; tatah, then; O Dhananjaya, iccha, seek, pray; aptum, to attain; mam, Me, as the Cosmic person; abhyasa-yogena, through the Yoga of Practice.
Practice consists in repeatedly fixing the mind on a single object by withdrawing it from everything else. The yoga following from this, and consisting in concentration of the mind, is abhyasa-yoga.
13.1 Arjuna said  I wish to learn about Nature (matter) and the Spirit (soul), the field and the knower of the field, knowledge and that which ought to be known, O Kesava.
13.1 "Arjuna asked: My Lord! Who is God and what is Nature; what is Matter and what is the Self; what is that they call Wisdom, and what is it that is worth knowing? I wish to have this explained.
13.1. No such translation is available for this sloka.
13.1 There is no such translation for this sloka.
13.1 Swami Gambhirananda has not translated this sloka. Many editions of the Bhagavadgita do not contain this sloka, including the commentary by Sankaracharya. If this sloka is included, the total number of slokas in the Bhagavadgita is 701.
13.1 No commentary.
13.1  Inclusion of this sloka, spoken by Arjuna, brings the total number of slokas in the Bhagavadgita to 701. Many versions of the Bhagavadgita, including the current commentary by Dr. S Sankaranarayan, do not include this sloka.
13.10 Non-attachment, non-identification of the Self with son, wife, home and the rest, and constant even-mindedness on the attainment of the desirable and the undesirable.
13.10 Indifference, non-attachment to sex, progeny or home, equanimity in good fortune and in bad;
13.10. Non-attachment; detachment towards [one's] children, wives, houses and the like; and a constant eal-mindedness on the occurrence of the desirable and the undesirable things;
13.10 Non-attachment, absence of clinging to son, wife, home and the like, and constant even-mindedness to all desirable and undesirable events;
13.10 Non-attachment and absence of fondness with regard to sons, wives, homes, etc., and constant eanimity of the mind with regard to the attainment of the desirable and the undesirable;
13.10 'Non-attachment' means freedom from attachment to things other than the self. 'Absecne of clinging' to son, wife, home and the like means absence of excessive affection for these beyond the limits allowed by the Sastras. 'Constant even-mindedness' to all desirable and undesriable events means the state of freedom from joy and grief with regard to occurrences springing from desire.
13.10 See Comment under 13.12
13.10 Asaktih, non-attachment-attachment means merely the kind for things arising from association; the absence of that is asaktih; and anabhisvangah, absence of fondness-abhisvangah, is in fact a special kind of attachment consisting of the idea of self-identification; as for instance, thinking 'I myself am happy,' or, 'I am sorrowful,' when somody else is happy or unhappy, and thinking 'I live', or, 'I shall die,' when some- body else lives or dies-With regard to what? In answer the Lord says: putra-dara-grhadisu, with regard to sons, wives, homes, etc. From the use of 'etc.' (it is understood that this fondness is) even with regard to others who are liked very much-retinue of sevants and so on. And since both these (absence of attachment and fondness) lead to Knowledge, therefore they are called Knowledge.
And nityam, constant; sama-cittatvam, eanimity of mind, mental eipoise;-with regard to what?-ista-anista-upapattisu, the attainment of the desirable and the undesirable; mental eipoise with regard to them, always, without exception. One does not become happy on the attainment of the desirable, nor does he become angry on the attainment of the undesirable. And that constant eanimity of mind which is of this kind is Knowledge
Further,
13.11 Unswerving devotion unto Me by the Yoga of non-separation, resort to solitary places, distaste for the society of men.
13.11 Unswerving devotion to Me, by concentration on Me and Me alone, a love for solitude, indifference to social life;
13.11. And an unfailing devotion towards Me, with the Yoga of non-difference; resorting to solitary place; distaste for a crowd of people;
13.11 Constant devotion directed to Me alone, resort to solitary places and dislike for crowds:
13.11 And unwavering devotion to Me with single-minded concentration; inclination to repair into a clean place; lack of delight in a crowd of people;
13.11 'Constant devotion' means devotion with a single end, namely, Myself the Lord of all; 'remaining in places free from people' means having no love for crowds of people.
13.11 See Comment under 13.12
13.11 Ca, and; avyabhicarini, unwavering-not having any tendency to deviate; bhaktih, devotion; mayi, to Me, to God; ananya-yogena, with single-minded concentration, with undivided concentration-ananyayogah is the decisive, unswerving conviction of this kind: 'There is none superior to Lord Vasudeva, and hence He alone is our Goal'; adoration with that. That too is Knowledge.
Vivikta-desa-sevitvam, inclination to repair into a clean place-a place (desa) naturally free (vivikta) or made free from impurity etc. and snakes, tigers, etc.; or, place made solitary (vivikta) by being situated in a forest, on a bank of a river, or in a temple; one who is inclined to seek such a place is vivikta-desa-sevi, and the abstract form of that is vivikta-desa-sevitvam. Since the mind becomes calm in places that are indeed pure (or solitary), therefore meditation on the Self etc. occurs in pure (or solitary) places. Hence the inclination to retire into clean (or solitary) places is called Knowledge.
Aratih, lack of delight, not being happy; jana-samadi, in crowd of people-an assemblage, a multitude of people without culture, lacking in purity and immodest-, (but) not (so) in a gathering of pure and modest persons since that is conducive to Knowledge. Hence, lack of delight in an assembly of common people is Knowledge since it leads to Knowledge.
Besides,
13.12 Constancy in Self-knowledge, perception of the end of true knowledge  this is declared to be knowledge, and what is opposed to it is ignorance.
13.12 Constant yearning for the knowledge of Self, and pondering over the lessons of the great Truth - this is Wisdom, all else ignorance.
13.12. Constancy in the Self-knowledge; and viewing things of knowing the Reality-all this is declared to be  [conducive to or manifesting] true knowledge, and what is opposed to this is  [conducive to or manifesting]  wrong knowledge.
13.12 Constant contemplation on the knowledge pertaining to the self, reflection for the attainment of knowledge of the truth - this is declared to be knowledge, and what is contrary to it is ignorance.
13.12 Steadfastness in the knowledge of the Self, contemplation on the Goal of the knowledge of Reality-this is spoken of as Knowledge. Ignorance is that which is other than this.
13.12 'Adhyatma-jnana' is the knowledge that pertains to the self. Reflection for the attainment of knowledge of the truth, namely, being always intent in the thought having for its object the knowledge of the truth. 'Knowledge' is that by which the self is realised. The meaning is that it is the means for the knowledge of the self. The group of attributes mentioned before, beginning with modesty etc., are those that are favourable for the knowledge of the self in association with the body. All the evolutes of Ksetra, which are different from those mentioned above, constitute ignorance, as they are antagonistic to the knowledge of the self.

Now, the nature of Ksetrajna, characterised as the knower in the stanza, 'He who knows it' (13.1), is examined:
13.8-12  Amanitvam etc.  upto anyatha.  [Devotion] with me Yoga of non-difference etc. :  a conviction, 'There exists nothing else different from the Mighty Lord, the Supreme Soul,' - a conviction, which allows no difference and is itself a Yoga, i.e. a devotion in the form of this conviction.  Hence this never fails.  For, either the desires that are considered to be causes for failure are absent, or those desires which are of the form of mind-modifications,  are completely absorbed in Him alone.  The above may be borne in mind in all [other] cases too.  What is opposed to this is  [conducive to]  wrong  knowledge :  such as pride and others.
 That which is to be known by this knowledge is described  [as] -
13.12 Adhyatma-jnana-nityatvam, steadfastness in the knowledge of the Self: adhyatma-jnanam is the knowledge of the Self, etc.; constant dwelling in that is nityatvam.
Tattva-jnanartha-darsanam, contemplating on the Goal of the knowledge of Reality: Tattva-jnanam is that (realization of Truth) which arises from the fruition of application to the disciplines like humility etc. which are the means to knowledge. Its Goal (artha) is Liberation, the cessation of mundane existence. Contemplation (darsana) on that is tattva-jnana-artha-darsanam. For, when one engages in contemplation on the result of the knowledge of Reality, one gets the urge to undertake the disciplines which are its means.
Etat, this-those that have been stated from 'humility' etc. to 'contemplation on the Goal of the knowledge of Reality'; proktam, is spoken of; iti, as; jnanam, Knowledge, because they are meant to lead one to Knowledge. Ajnanam, ignorance; is yat, that which is; anyatha, other; atah, than this-what has been stated above.
Contrarily, arrogance, pretentiousness, cruelty, revenge, insincerity, etc. are to be known as ignorance so that, since they are the cause of the origination of worldly existence, they can be avoided.
To the estion as to what is to be known through the aforesaid Knowledge, the Lord says, 'I shall speak of that which is to be known,' etc.
Objection: Do not humility etc. constitute yama and niyama [See fn. on p. 239.-Tr.]? The Knowable is not known through them. For humility etc. are not seen to determine the nature of anything. Moreover, everywhere it is observed that whatever knowledge reveals its own object, that itself ascertains the nature of that object of knowledge (the knowable). Indeed, nothing else is known through a knowledge concerning some other object. As for instance, fire is not known through the knowledge of a pot.
Reply: This is not a defect, for we have said that they are called 'Knowledge' because they lead one to Knowledge, and because they are auxiliary causes of Knowledge.
13.13 I will declare that which has to be known, knowing which one attains to immortality, the beginningless supreme Brahman, called neither being nor non-being.
13.13 I will speak to thee now of that great Truth which man ought to know, since by its means he will win immortal bliss - that which is without beginning, the Eternal Spirit which dwells in Me, neither with form, nor yet without it.
13.13. I shall describe that which is to be known, by knowing which one attains freedom from death : beginningless is the Supreme Brahman; It is said to be neither existent nor non-existent.
13.13 I shall declare that which is to be known, knowing which one attains the immortal self. It is beginningless brahman having Me for the Highest (Anadi matparam); it is said to be neither being nor-being.
13.13 I shall speak of that which is to be known, by realizing which one attains Immortality. The supreme Brahman is without any beginning. That is called neither being nor non-being.
13.13 I shall declare that nature of the individual self (brahman) which is the object to be known, namely, what is to be gained by means of virtues like modesty etc., by knowing which one attains to the self which is immortal, birthless, free from old age, death and such other material alities. [The expression is split up as - Anadi = beginningless; Mat-param = having Me as the Highest.] Anadi means that which is beginningless. Indeed, there is no origination for this individual self (brahman) and for the same reason, It is endless. The Sruti also declares:  'The wise one is not born, nor dies' (Ka. U., 2.18). 'Matpara' means having Me for the Highest. Verily, it has been told:  'Know that which is other than this (lower nature), which is the life-principle, to be the highest Prakrti of Mine' (7.5). By virtue of being the body of the Lord, the nature of the self finds joy in being completely subsidiary to Him. So the Sruti declares:  'He who, dwelling in the self, is within the self, whom the self does not know, whose body the self is and who controls the self from within ৷৷.' (Br. U. Madh., 5.7.22). Similarly do the texts declare:  'He is the cause, Lord of Lords and of sense organs. He has no progenitor, nor lord' (Sve. U., 6.9); and 'He is the Lord of the Pradhana and of the individual selves, and the Lord of alities (Ibid., 6.16).

That which is conjoined with the ality of infinite dimension or extensiveness can be designated as brahman. It is different from, and not circumscribable by, the body etc. The meaning is, It is the principle which apprehends the Ksetra. Sruti also declares:  'He (i.e., the individual self) partakes of infinity' (Sve. U., 5.9). By its Karma It is circumscribed. It assumes Its infinite nature only when It is freed from the bonds of Karma. The term brahman is applied to designate the individual self as in:  'He, crossing beyond the Gunas', becomes fit for the sake of brahman' (14.26), 'I am the ground of the brahman, who is immutable and immortal' (14.27), and 'Having attained to the state of brahman, tranil, he neither grieves nor craves; regarding all beings alike, he attains supreme devotion to Me' (18.54).

It (brahman) is said to be neither being nor non-being. The terms 'being' and 'non-being' cannot signify the nature of the self because It is neither effect nor cause. For It is called 'being' (Sat) in the condition of effect when It has the form of gods etc. As It cannot possess names and forms in the condition of cause, It is said to be 'non-being' or Asat. So the Sruti texts declare:  'In the beginning, verily, this (brahman) was non-existence; therefrom the being was born' (Tai. U., 2.7.1) and 'Verily, this (brahman) was then undifferntiated. It became differentiated by names and forms' (Br. U., 1.4.7). The self's conditions as effect and cause have arisen on account of veiling by Avidya or ignorant in the form of Karma. It is not an expression of Its real nature. So, the terms 'being' and 'non-being' do not signify the nature of the self, If it is argued that, in the passage 'In the beginning, verily, this (Brahman) was non-existence' (Tai. U., 2.7.1), it is the Supreme Brahman in the state of cause that is described - even then it can be pointed out that the Supreme Brahman in causal condition has, for His body, the conscient and non-conscient entities in a subtle state, incapable of being differentiated by names and forms. Such a description is therefore valid. On the same principle the nature of Ksetra (body) and Ksetrajna (individual self) in the state of cause can also be indicated by the term 'non-being'. But this condition of the individual self has arisen due to Karma and such descriptions as 'being' and 'non-being' are applicable to the self only in the state of bondage. Its pure form cannot be signified by the terms 'being' and 'non-being'.
13.13 See Comment under 13.18
13.13 Pravaksyami, I shall speak of, fully describe just as it is; tat, that; yat, which; is jenyam, to be known. In order to interest the hearer through inducement, the Lord speaks of what its result is: Jnatva, by realizing; yat, which Knowable; asnute, one attains; amrtam, Immortality, i.e.; he does not die again. Anadimat, without beginning-one having a beginning (adi) is adimat; one not having a beginning is anadimat. What is that? The param, supreme, unsurpassable; brahma, Brahman, which is under discussion as the Knowable.
Here, some split up the phrase anadimatparam as anadi and matparam because, if the word anadimat is taken as a Bahuvrihi compound, ['That which has no (a), beginning (adi) is anadi.' Matup is used to denote possession. Since the idea of possession is a already implied in anadi, therefore matup, if added after it, becomes redundant.] then the suffix mat (matup) becomes redundant, which is undesirable. And they show a distintive meaning: (Brahman is anadi, beginningless, and is) matparam, that of which I am the supreme (para) power called Vasudeva. Trully, the redundance could be avoided in this way if that meanig were possible. But that meaning is not possible, because what is intended is to make Brahman known only through a negation of all attributes by saying, 'It is called neither being nor non-being.' It is contradictory to show a possession of a distinctive power and to negate attributes. Therefore, although matup and a bahuvrihi compound convey the same meaning of 'possession', its (matup's) use is for completing the verse. [The Commentator accepts anadimat as a nan-tatpurusa compund. If, however, the Bahuvrihi is insisted on, then the mat after anadi should be taken as completing the number of syllables needed for versification. So, nat need not be compounded with param.]
Having aroused an interest through inducement by saying, 'The Knowable which has Immortality as its result is beeing spoken of by Me,' the Lord says: Tat, that Knowable; ucyate, is called; na sat, neither being; nor is it called asat, non-being.
Objection: After strongly girding up the loins and declaring with a loud voice, 'I shall speak of the Knowable,' is it not incongruous to say, 'That is called neither being nor non-being'?
Reply: No. What has been said is surely consistent. 
Objection: How?
Reply: For in all the Upanisads, the Knowable, i.e. Brahman, has been indicated only by negation of all attributes-'Not this, not this' (Br. 4.4.22), 'Not gross, not subtle' (op. cit. 3.3.8), etc.; but not as 'That is this', for It is beyond speech.
Objection: Is it not that a thing which cannot be expressed by the word 'being' does not exist? Like-wise, if the Knowable cannot be expressed by the word 'being', It does not exist. And it is contradictory to say, 'It is the Knowable', and 'It cannot be expressed by the word "being".'
Counter-objection: As to that, no that It does not exist, because It is not the object of the idea, 'It is non-being.'
Objection: Do not all cognitions verily involve the idea of being or non-being? This being so, the Knowable should either be an object of a cognition involving the idea of existence, or it should be an object of a cognition involving the idea of non-existence.
Reply: No, because, by virtue of Its being super-sensuous, It is not an object of cognition involving either, of the two ideas. Indeed, any object perceivable by the senses, such as pot etc., can be either an object of cognition involving the idea of existence, or it can be an object of cognition involving the idea of non-existence. But this Knowable, being supersensuous and known from the scriptures, which are the sole means of (Its) knowledge, is not, like pot etc., an object of cognition involving either of the two ideas. Therefore It is called neither being nor non-being.
As for your objection that it is contradictory to say, 'It is the Knowable, but it is neither called being nor non-being,'-it is not contradictory; for the Upanisad says, 'That (Brahman) is surely different from the known and, again, It is above the unknown' (Ke. 1.4).
Objection: May it not be that even the Upanisad is contradictory in its meaning? May it not be (contradictory) as it is when, after beginning with the topic of a shed for a sacrifice, [Cf. 'Pracinavamsam karoti, he constructs (i.e. shall construct) (the sacrificial shed) with its supporting beam turned east-ward' (Tai, Sam.; also see Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Monier Williams).-Tr.] it is said, 'Who indeed knows whether there exists anything in the other world or not!' (Tai. Sam. 6.1.1)?
Reply: No, since the Upanisad speaking of something that is different from the known and the unknown is meant for establishing an entity that must be realized. [The Upanisadic text is not to be rejected on the ground that it is paradoxical, for it is meant to present Brahman as indentical with one's own inmost Self.] But, '৷৷.whether there exists anything in the other world,' etc. is merely an arthavada [See note on p. 40. Here, the passage, '৷৷.whether there exists৷৷.,' etc. is to be interpreted as an arthavada emphasizing, the need of raising a shed, irrespective of any other consideration.-Tr.] connected with an injunction.
From reason who it follows that Brahman cannot be expressed by such words as being, non-being, etc. For, every word used for expressing an object, when heard by listeners, makes them understand its meaning through the comprehension of its significance with the help of genus, action, ality and relation; not in any other way, because that is not a matter of experience. To illustrate this: a cow, or a horse, etc. (is comprehended) through genus; cooking or reading, through action; white or black, through ality; a rich person or an owner of cows, through relation. But Brahman does not belong to any genus. Hence it is not expressible by words like 'being' etc.; neither is It possessed of any alitity with the help of which It could be expressed through alifying words, for It is free from alities; nor can It be expressed by a word implying action, It being free from actions-which accords with the Upanisadic text, 'Partless, actionless, calm' (Sv. 6.19). Nor has It any relation, since It is one, non-dual, not an object of the senses, and It is the Self.
Therefore it is logical that It cannot be expressed by any word. And this follows from such Upanisadic texts as, 'From which, words trun back' (Tai. 2.4.1), etc.
Therefore it is logical that It cannot be expressed by any word. And this follows from such Upanisadic texts as, 'From which, words turn back' (Tai. 2.4.1), etc.
Since the Knowable (Brahman) is not an object of the word or thought of 'being', there arises the apprehension of Its nonexistence. Hence, for dispelling that apprehension by establishing Its existence with the help of the adjuncts in the form of the organs of all creatures, the Lord says:
13.14 With hands and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads and mouths everywhere, with ears everywhere, He exists in the worlds enveloping all.
13.14 Everywhere are Its hands and Its feet; everywhere It has eyes that see, heads that think and mouths that speak; everywhere It listens; It dwells in all the worlds; It envelops them all.
13.14. It has hands and feet of all, has eyes, heads and faces of all, has ears of all in the world;  It remains enveloping all.
13.14 Everywhere are Its hands and feet; Its eyes, heads and mouths are everywhere; Its ears are on all sides; and It exists encompassing all things.
13.14 That (Knowable), which has hands and feet everwhere, which has eyes, heads and mouths everywhere, which has ears everywhere, exists in creatures by pervading them all.
13.14 Everywhere are Its hands and feet i.e., the self in Its pure form is able to perform everywhere the works of hands and feet. Its eyes, heads and mouths are everywhere; It performs everywhere the task of eyes etc. The Sruti declares; 'Without feet or hands, He moves swiftly and seizes things; He sees without eyes, He hears without ears?  (Sve. U., 3.19). It may be said that it means that the Supreme Brahman performs everywhere the task of hands, feet etc., even though He is devoid of hands and feet. If 'Brahman' is taken to mean the self, it can be asked how this power of the Supreme Brahman (namely, having hand, feet, eyes, etc., everywhere) can be attributed to the self, then the answer is that it is established in the Srutis that the pure individual self has the capacity of performing the task of hands, feet etc., because It is eal to Him. Sruti also declares:  'Then, the wise seer, shaking off good and evil, stainless, attains the supreme eality with Him' (Mun. U., 3.1.3). Sri Krsna will also teach later on:  'Resorting to this knowledge, It partakes of My nature' (14.2). It exists encompassing all things, whatever aggregate of things that exist in the world; It encompasses them. The sense is that in Its pure state, It is all-pervasive, as It has no limitation of space etc.
13.14 See Comment under 13.18
13.14 Tat, That-the Knowable; sarvatah-pani-padam, which has hands and feet everywhere-.
The existence of the Knower of the field is revealed through th adjuncts in the form of the organs of all creatures. And the Knower of the field is spoken of as such because of the limiting adjuncts of the field. The field, too, is diversely differentiated as hands, feet, etc. All diversity in the Knower of the field, caused by the differences in the adjunct-the field-, is certainly unreal. Hence, by denying it, the nature of the Knowable has been stated, in, 'That is called neither being nor non-being.' Although the unreal form is caused by the limiting adjuncts, still, for the comprehension of Its existence it is said, '(It) has hands and feet everywhere, etc., by assuming this as a ality of the Knowable. Thus, as is well known, there is saying of the people versed in tradition, 'The Transcendental is described with the help of superimposition and its refutation'. Everywhere the hands, feet, etc., which are perceived as limbs of all bodies, perform, their duties due to the presence of the power of the Knowable (Brahman). Thus the grounds for the inference of the existence of the Knowable are metaphorically spoken of as belonging to the Knowable. The others have to be explained similarly.
That Knowable has hands and feet everwhere. That which has eyes, heads, and mouths everywhere is sarvatoksi-siro-mukham. That which has ears every-where is sarvatah-srutimat: sruti means the organs of hearing; that which has it is sruti-mat. Tisthati, It exists, remains established; loke, in the multititude of creatures; avrtya, by pervading; sarvam, them all.
With this purpose is view, that as a result of the superimposition of the organs like hands, feet, etc., which are adjuncts, there may not be the misconception that the Knowable is possessed of them (adjuncts), the (next) verse is begun:
13.15 Shining by the functions of all the senses, yet without the senses; unattached, yet supporting all; devoid of alities, yet their experiencer.
13.15 Beyond the senses, It yet shines through every sense perception. Bound to nothing, It yet sustains everything. Unaffected by the Qualities, It still enjoys them all.
13.15. It causes all the sense-alities to shine;  [yet]  It is without any sense-organ;  It is unattached, yet all-supporting;  It is free from the Strands, yet enjoys the Strands.
13.15 Shining by the functions of the senses, and yet devoid of the senses, detached and yet supporting all, devoid of Gunas and yet experiencing the Gunas;
13.15 Shining through the functions of all the organs, (yet) devoid of all the organs; unattached, and verily the supporter of all; without ality, and the perceiver of alities;
13.15 Sarvendriya-gunabhasam i.e., shining by the functions of the senses - means that which is shedding light on the functions of all the senses. The 'Gunas' of the senses means the activities of the senses. The meaning is that the self is capable of knowing the objects with the functioning of the senses. 'Yet devoid of the senses' i.e., It is capable by Itself, of knowing everything. Such is the meaning. It is 'detached', namely, It is free, by nature, from attachment to the bodies of gods etc. 'Yet supporting all,' yet capable of supporting all bodies, such as of gods etc., as declared in the Sruti. 'It is one, is threefold ৷৷.' (Cha. U., 7.26.2). It is devoid of Gunas, i.e., by nature It is devoid of Sattva etc., and yet It is the experiencer of the Gunas' - It has the capability to experience Sattva etc.
13.15 See Comment under 13.18
13.15 Sarvendriya-guna-abhasam, shining through the functions of all the organs: By the use of the words all the organs are understood ears etc., known as the sense-organs and motor-organs, as also the internal organs-the intellect and the mind, for they are eally the limiting adjuncts of the Knowable. Besides, the organs of hearing etc. become the limiting adjuncts from the very fact of the internal organ becoming so. Hence, the Knowable gets expressed through determination, thinking, hearing, speaking, etc. that are the functions of all the organs, internal and external, which are the limiting adjuncts. In this way, It is manifest through the functions of all the organs. The idea is that, that Knowable appears to be as though active owing to the functions of all the organs, as it is said in the Upanisadic text, 'It thinks, as it were, and shakes, as it were' (Br. 4.3.7).
For that reason, again, is It not perceived as being actually active? In answer the Lord says: It is sarva-indriya-varitam, devoid of all the organs, i.e. bereft of all the instruments of action. Hence the Knowable is not active through the functioning of the instruments of action. As for the Upanisadic verse, 'Without hands and feet He moves swiftly and grasps; without eyes He sees, without ears He hears' (Sv. 3.19), etc.-that is meant for showing that that Knowable has the power of adapting Itself to the functions of all the organs which are Its limiting adjuncts; but it is not meant to show that It really has such activity as moving fast etc. The meaning of that verse is like that of the Vedic text, 'The blind one discoverd a gem' (Tai, Ar. 1.11). [This is an artha-veda (see note on p.530), which is not to be taken literally but interpreted in accordance with the context.]
Since the Knowable is devoid of all the instruments of actions, therefore It is asaktam, unattached, devoid of all associations. Although It is of this kind, yet it is ca eva, also verily; the sarva-bhrt, supporter of all. Indeed, everything has existence as its basis, because the idea of 'existence' is present everywhere. Verily, even mirage etc. do not occur without some basis. Therefore, It is sarva-bhrt, the supporter of all-It upholds everything.
There can be this other organs as well for the realization of the existence of the Knowable: Nirgunam, without ality-the alities are sattva, rajas and tamas; that Knowable is free from them; and yet It is the guna-bhoktr, perceiver of alities; i.e., that Knowable is the enjoyer and experiencer of the alities, sattva, rajas and tamas, which, assuming the forms of sound etc., transform them-selves into happiness, sorrow, delusion, etc.
Further,
13.16 Without and within (all) beings the unmoving and also the moving; because of Its subtlety, unknowable; and near and far away is That.
13.16 It is within all beings, yet outside; motionless yet moving; too subtle to be perceived; far away yet always near.
13.16. It is without and within every being and is unmoving and yet moving too; due to Its subtle  nature It is incomprehensible; It exists far away, yet near It is.
13.16 It is within and without all beings; It is unmoving and yet moving; It is so subtle that none can comprehend It; It is far away, and yet It is very near.
13.16 Existing outside and inside all beings; moving as well as non-moving, It is incomprehensible due to subtleness. So also, It is far away, and yet near.
13.16 Abandoning the elements like earth etc., It can exist outside the body. It can exist within them while performing spontaneous activities as established in the Srutis:  'Eating, playing, enjoying with partners or with vehicles' (Cha. U., 8.12.3). 'It is unmoving and yet moving' - it is by nature, unmoving, It is moving when It has a body. It is so subtle that none can comprehend It. Although existing in a body, this principle, possessed of all powers and omniscient, cannot be comprehended by bound ones because of Its subtlety and Its distinctiveness from the body. It is far away and yet It is very near - though present in one's own body, It is far away from those who are devoid of modesty and other alities (mentioned above) as also to those who possess contrary alities. To those who possess modesty and such other alities, the same self is very near.
13.16 See Comment under 13.18
13.16 Existing, bahih, outside- the word bahih is used with reference to the body including the skin, which is misconceived through ignorance to be the Self, and which is itself taken as the boundary. Similarly, the word antah, inside, is used with reference to the indwelling Self, making the body itself as the boundary. When 'outside' and 'inside' are used, there may arise the contingency of the nonexistence of That in the middle. Hence this is said: acaram caram eva ca, moving as well as not moving-even that which appears as the body, moving or not moving, is nothing but the Knowable, in the same way as the appearance of a snake on a rope (is nothing but the rope).
In all empirical things, moving as also non-moving, be the Knowable, why should It not be known by all as such? In answer it is said: It is true that It shines through everything; still it is subtle like space. Therefore, although It is the Knowable, tat, It; is avijneyam, incomprehensible to the ignorant people; suksmatvat, due to Its intrinsic subtleness. But to the enlightened It is ever known from the valid means of knowledge such as (the texts), 'All this is verily the Self' (Ch. 7.25.2), 'Brahman alone is all this' (Nr. Ut.7), etc. It is durastham, far away, since, to the unenlightened, It is unattainable even in millions of years. And tat, That; is antike, near, since It is the Self of the enlightened.
13.17 And undivided, yet It exists as if divided in beings; It is to be known as the supporter of being; It devours and It generates.
13.17 In all beings undivided, yet living in division, It is the upholder of all, Creator and Destroyer alike;
13.17. It remains undistinguished  (common) in the distinguished  [beings],  and appears as if distinguished.  It is to be known as the supporter of beings, and also as  [their] swallower and orginator.
13.17 Undivided and yet remaining as if divided among beings, this self is to be known as the supporter of elements. It devours them and causes generation.
13.17 And the Knowable, though undivided, appears to be existing as divided in all beings, and It is the sustainer of all beings as also the devourer and originator.
13.17 Though the entity called the self is present everywhere in the bodies of divinities, men etc., It is 'undivided' because of Its form being that of the knower. However, to those who are ignorant, It appears divided, by such forms as those of divinities etc. - 'I am a divinity,' 'man' etc. Though the self can be contemplated by way of co-ordinate predication as one with the body in such significations as, 'I am divinity, I am a man,' It can be known as being different from the body, because of Its being a knower. That is why it has already been pointed out at the beginning:  'He who knows It?  (13.1).

Now Sri Krsna says that It can be known as different also on other grounds - as the 'supporter of elements' etc. Because It supports the earth and other elements combined in the shape of the body, the self can be known as being different from the elements supported. The sense is that It can be known as a separate entity. Likewise, It is that which 'devours', namely, the consumer of physical food etc. Because, It 'devours' the food, It can be known as an entity different from the elements. It causes 'generation' - It is the cause of transformation of consumed food etc., into other forms like blood etc. As eating, generating etc., are not seen in a corpse, it is settled that the body, an aggregate of elements, cannot be the cause of devouring food, generating of species and supporting them.
13.17 See Comment under 13.18
13.17 And further, tat, that; jneyam, Knowable; though avibhaktam, undivided, remaining the same in all beings like space; iva sthitam, appears to be existing; as vibhaktam, divided; bhutesu, in all beings, because It is perceived as existing in the bodies themselves. And just as a rope etc. are with regard to a snake etc. That are falsely imagined, similarly that Knowable is bhutabhartr, the sustainer of all beings, sinced It sustains all during the period of their existence; grasisnu, the devourer, at the time of dissolution; and prabhavisnu, the originator, at the time of creation.
Further, it the Knowable is not perceived though existing everywhere, then It is darkness? Not! What then?
13.18 That, the Light of all lights, is said to be beyond darkness: knowledge, the knowable and the goal of knowledge, seated in the hearts of all.
13.18 It is the Light of lights, beyond the reach of darkness; the Wisdom, the only thing that is worth knowing or that wisdom can teach; the Presence in the hearts of all.
13.18. This is the Light even of  [all]  the lights,  [and]  is stated to be beyond darkness;  It is to be known by [the above]  knowledge; It is to be attained  [only] by knowledge;  and It distinctly remains in the heart of all.
13.18 The light of all lights, this is said to be beyond Tamas (darkness). It is known to be knowledge. It is to be attained by knowledge. It is present in the heart of all.
13.18 That is the Light even of the lights; It is spoken of as beyond darkness. It is Knowledge, the Knowable, and the Known. It exists specially [A variant reading is dhisthitam.-Tr.] in the hearts of all.
13.18 This (self) alone is the 'light' which illuminates things like the sun, a lamp, a gem etc. It is knowledge alone in the form of the effulgence of the self which illuminates a lamp, the sun etc. But a lamp etc., dispel the darkness that intervenes between the sense of sight and its subject. Their illuminating power is limited to this extent. This is said to be beyond Tamas (darkness). The term Tamas denotes Prakrti in its subtle state. The meaning is that the self transcends Prakrti. Therefore, It is to be comprehended as knowledge, i.e., to be understood as of the form of knowledge. It is attainable by means of knowledge - such as modesty etc., already described. It is present in the heart of all, i.e., It is specially settled, or present in the heart of all beings like men etc.
13.13-18 Jneyam etc. upto visthitam.  Beginningless is  the Supreme Brahman :  by means of the attributes  (descriptions) like these, [the Bhagavat] describes the Brahman as being not separate from the Supreme Consciousness  (or action)  expressed in every utterance and  [thus] gracing  [the seeker] to infer his [or Its] own nature.  These attributes however have already been explained.  Hence what is the use of a fruitless repetition ?
13.18 Tat, that Knowable; is the jyotih, Light; api, even; jyotisam, of the lights-of the sun etc. For the lights like the sun etc. shine because they are enkindled by the light of consciousness of the Self, as is known from Upanisadic texts like, 'Illumined by whose light the sun shines' (Tai. Br. 3.12.9.7), 'By Its light all this shines variously' (Sv. 6.14), and from the Smrti also, as here (in the Gita) itself: 'That light in the sun৷৷.' (15.12), etc.
It is ucyate, spoken of as; param, beyond, untouched by; tamasah, darkness; ignorance. For cheering up anyone who may become disheartened by thinking that Knowledge etc. is difficult to attain, the Lord says: It is jnanam, Knowledge-humility etc. (verse 7, etc.); jneyam, the Knowable, which has been spoken of in, 'I shall speak of that which is to be known' (12); and jnana-gamyam, the Known. The Knowable itself is referred to as jnanagamyam, when after being known, It becomes the result of Knowledge. But when It is an object to be known, It is called jneyam. All these three which are such, visthitam, specially exist; hrdi, in the hearts, in the intellects; sarvasya, of all, of all creatures.
For these three are, indeed, perceived there.
 
This verse is begun for concluding the topic under discussion:
13.19 Thus the field, as well as knowledge and the knowable have been briefly stated. My devotee, knowing this, enters into My Being.
13.19 Thus I have told thee in brief what Matter is, and the Self worth realising and what is Wisdom. He who is devoted to Me knows; and assuredly he will enter into Me.
13.19. This field as well as the knowledge and what is to be known, all are mentioned collectively; clearly understanding this, My devotee becomes worthy of  My state.
13.19 Thus the Ksetra, knowledge and the object of knowledge have been briefly set forth. On knowing this, My devotee becomes fit to attain My state of being.
13.19 Thus has been spoken of in brief the field as also Knowledge and the Knowable. By understanding this My devotee becomes alified for My state.
13.19 This is a brief description of the principle of Ksetra - i.e., the text beginning with 'The great elements, the Ahankara' (13.5) and ending with 'An association' (13.6). 'Knowledge' which is the means for attaining the comprehension of the principle known as the self has been taught in the text beginning with 'Modesty' (13.7) and ending with 'Reflection for attainment of knowledge of truth' (13.11). The nature of Ksetrajna (the self) which is the object of knowledge has also been concisely taught by the text beginning with 'The beginningless brahman having Me for the Highest' (13.12) and ending with 'present in the heart of all' (13.17). My devotee, on knowing this, i.e., the truth about the Ksetra, the truth about the means for attaining the nature of the self as distinct from the Ksetra, and the truth about the Ksetrajna, becomes worthy to attain My state of being. What is called My state of being is My own nature (Svabhava), namely, the transcendence of transmigratory existence. The meaning is that he becomes worthy to attain the state of freedom for transmigratory existence.

Next (1) the beginninglessness of the conjunction between the Prakrti and the self which are completely distinct, (2) the difference in the workings of these two when they are associated with each other, and (3) the cause of this conjunction - these are treated:
13.19 Etat etc. He, who understands this traid of the Field, the knowledge and what is to be known-he alone is a devotee of Mine; and he atains My state.		
 After making this definition, the same is now examined as -
13.19 Iti, thus; uktam, has been spoken-commencing from 'I shall speak of that which is to be known' (12) and ending with 'It is spoken of as beyond darkness' (17); samasatah, in brief; the ksetram, field -beginning with the 'great elements' and ending with 'for titude' (5,6); tatha, as also; jnanam, Knowledge-beginning from 'humility' (7) and ending with 'contemplation on the Goal of the knowledge of Reality' (11); and the jneyam, Knowable.
All this has been stated by way of summarizing the purport of the Vedas and the Gita. Who is fit for this true knowledge? The answer is: madbhaktah, My devotee, who attributes the fact of being the Self of all to Me who am God, Vasudeva, the Omniscient, the supreme Teacher, (and) whose conviction has been saturated with the idea that whatever he sees, hears or touches, all that verily is Lord Vasudeva. Vijnaya, by understanding; etat, this, the aforesaid true knowledge; he upa-padyate, becomes alified; mad-bhavaya, for My State (bhava) -the State of being the supreme Self; for that State of Mine. He attains Liberation.
There in the Seventh Chapter have been presented the two aspects [Cf. 15.16-18.] of God, viz the higher and the lower, characterized as the field and the Knower of the field. And it has also been said, '(Understand thus) that all things have these as their source' (7.6). The explanation as to how creatures have the two aspects, the field and the Knower of the field, as their source is now being stated:
13.2 The Blessed Lord said  This body, O Arjuna, is called the field; he who knows it is called the knower of the field, by those who know of them.
13.2 Lord Shri Krishna replied: O Arjuna! The body of man is the playground of the Self; and That which knows the activities of Matter, sages call the Self.
13.2. The Bhagavat said  O son of  Kunti !  This [physical] hody is called  'Field'  [and decayer-cum-protector];  He, who sensitiezes it - His knowers call Him properly as 'Field-sensitizer'.
13.2 The Lord said  This body, O Arjuna, is called the Field, Ksetra. He who knows it is called the Filed-knower, Ksetrajna, by those who know the self.
13.2 The Blessed Lord said  O son of Kunti, this body is referred to as the 'field'. Those who are versed in this call him who is conscious of it as the 'knower of the field'.
13.2 The body which is cognised in identity with the experiencing self by co-ordinate predication (Samanadhikaranya) in the propositions, 'I am a god, 'I am a man,' 'I am fat,' 'I am slender' etc., is described by those who know the real nature of the body as only the Field (Ksetra) of experience for the experiencing self, who is distinct from the body. Those who know this, namely, those who know the exact nature of the self, call It the Field-knower (Ksetrajna). That knower who knows the body, as divided into its different members and as their collectivity, can say 'I know it, the body, as an object.' The person with this perception is the one who is called the Ksetrajna or the Field-knower, who must necessarily be different from the Field (Ksetra), which is the object of this knowledge.

It is true that at the time of perceiving an object like a pot which is different from one's body, the seer who thinks 'I am a god who sees it' or 'I am a man who sees it' etc., is putting himself as identical with the body through co-ordinate predication. In the same way he experiences the body as an object of knowledge when he says 'I know this body.' Thus if the body is an object of knowledge, it must be different from the knowing self. Therefore, the Field-knower (Ksetrajna). The knower, is other than the body which is an object of knowledge like a jar, etc.

But this knowledge which arises by way of co-ordinate predication is justified on the ground that the body is inseparable from oneself; for it constitutes an attribute of the self like 'cow-ness' of the cow etc. The knowing self is however unie in being an eternal and subtle form of knowledge. But this is inaccessible to the ordinary man's organs of vision; it is accessible only to a mind refined by Yoga. The ignorant see the knower only in the form of Prakrti because of close proximity to or union with Prakrti. Sri Krsna thus declares later on:  'When in identiciation with the Gunas he departs or stays or experiences, the deluded perceive him not. They, who have the eye of knowledge, see' (15.10).
13.2 See Comment under 13.3
13.2 The Lord specifies the body as the object referred to by the pronoun idam (this). O son of Kunti, (this body) abhidhiyate, is referred to; ksetram iti, as the field-because it is protected (tra) against injury (ksata), or because it perishes (ksi), wastes away (ksar), or because the results of actions get fulfilled in the body as in a field (ksetra). The word iti is used in the sense of 'as'.
They-who?-tadvidah, who are versed in this, who know the 'field' and the 'knower of the field'; ahuh, call; tam, him, the knower; yah, who; vetti etat, is concious of, knows, it, the body, the field-makes it, from head to foot, an abject of his knowledge; makes it an object of perception as a separate entity, through knowledg which is spontaneous or is acired through instruction; ksetrajna iti, as the knower of the field. As before, the word iti is used in the sense of 'as'. They call him as the knower of the field.
Is it that the field and the knower of the field thus mentioned are to be understood through this much knowledge only? The answer is, no.
13.20 Know thou that Nature (matter) and the Spirit are both beginningless; and know also that all modifications and alities are born of Nature.
13.20 Know thou further that Nature and God have no beginning; and that differences of character and quality have their origin in Nature only.
13.20. Both the Material Cause and the Soul too are beginningless, you should know this; you should also know that the modifications and Strands are born of the Material Cause.
13.20 Know that both Prakrti and the self (Purusa) are without beginning; know that all modifications and the attributes are born of Prakrti.
13.20 Know both Nature and also the individual soul [Prakrti is sometimes translated as matter, and purusa as spirit.-Tr.] to be verily without beginning; know the modifications as also the alities as born of Nature.
13.20 Know this Prakrti and Purusa (self) are uncreated and are beginningless. Know that the modifications, desire, hatred etc., which cause bondage, and the alities of modesty etc., which cause release, originate from Prakrti. The Prakrti, having no beginning, develops into the form of the body, and conjoint with the self, causes bondage through its own transformations such as desire and hatred. The same Prakrti, through its transformations like modesty etc., causes release. Such is the meaning.

The difference in the functions of Prakrti and Purusa in combination is stated -
13.20 See Comment under 13.23
13.20 Viddhi, know; ubhau, both; prakrtim Nature; and also the purusam, individual soul;-these two; Nature and the soul. the aspects of God-to be api, verily; anadi, without beginning. Those two that have no beginning (adi), are anadi. Since the godhood of God is eternal, therefore it is logical that even His aspects also should have eternality. For God's god-hood consists verily in having the two aspects. Those two aspects through which God becomes the cause of creation, continuance and dissolution of the Universe, and which are beginningless, are the sources of mundane existence.
Some interpret the phrase anadi in the tatpurusa [Tatpurusa: Name of a class of compounds in which the first member determines the sense of the other members, or in which the last member is defined or alified by the first, without losing its original independence.-V.S.A.] sense of na adi, not primeval (not cause). (According to them) thery indeed is established the causality of God. Again, if Nature and soul themselves be eternal, the mundane existence would surely be their creation, and the causality of the mundane existence would not be God's.
That is wrong because, there being nothing to rule over before the emergence of Nature and soul, there will arise the contingency of God ceasing to be God! And if the mundane state be uncaused [Uncaused, i.e. not caused by Nature and soul, but by God independently of those two aspects.] there arises the contingency of the absence of Liberation, [If God were. Himself the sole cause of mundane existence, independently of His two aspects, then it would be endless because there would be nothing to prevent liberated souls from being put under bondage again.] the scriptures becoming useless, and the absence of bondage and freedom. On the other hand, all these become justifiable if God and the two aspects be eternal.
How?
Viddhi, know; the vikaran, modifications that will be spoken of-the intellect etc., the body and the organs; ca eva, as also; gunan, the alities (sattva etc.)-manifest in the form of the mental states of happiness, sorrow and attachment; as prakriti-sambhavan, born of Nature. Nature, Maya, is the power of God, which is the cause of the modifications and which consists of the three alities. Those modifications and alities, which have that Nature as their source,-know those modifications and alities as 'born of Nature', as transformations of Nature.
Which again, are those modifications and alities born of Nature?
13.21 In the production of the effect and the cause, Nature (matter) is said to be the cause; in the experience of pleasure and pain, the soul is said to be the cause.
13.21 Nature is the Law which generates cause and effect; God is the source of the enjoyment of all pleasure and pain.
13.21. In creating  [the process of]  cause-and-effect, the Material Cause is said to be the basis; and in experiencing pleasure and pain, the Soul is said to be the basis.
13.21 The Prakrti is said to be the cause of agency to the body (Karya) and sense-organs (Karana). The self is said to be the cause of experiencing pleasure and pain.
13.21 With regard to the source of body and organs, Nature is said to be the cause. The soul is the cause so far as enjoyership of happiness and sorrow is concerned.
13.21 The 'Karya' means the body, the 'Karanas' mean the instruments, i.e., the senses of perception and action plus the Manas. In their operations, the Prakrti, subservient to the self, is alone the causal factor. The sense is that their operations, which are the means of experience, have their foundation in the Prakrti, which has developed in the form of the body subservient to the self. In regard to this, the authority is the aphorism, 'The self is an agent, on account of the scriptures having the purpose' (B. S., 2.3.33) etc. The agency of the self means that the self is the cause of the will (effort) to support the body. The self (Purusa) associated with the body is the cause for experiencing pleasures and pains. The meaning is that It is the seat of those experiences.

Thus, has been explained the difference in the operations of the Prakrti and of the self when they are mutually conjoined. He now proceeds to explain how, though the self, which in Its pristine nature experiences Itself by Itself as nothing but joy, becomes the cause of experiencing both pleasure and pain derived from sense objects when It is conjoined with a body.

The term Guna figuratively represents effects. The self (in Its pristine nature) experiences Itself by Itself, as nothing buy joy. But when dwelling in the body, i.e., when It is in conjunction with the Prakrti, It experiences the alities born of Prakrti, namely, happiness, pain etc., which are the effects of Gunas like Sattva etc.

He explains the cause of conjunction with the Prakrti:
13.21 See Comment under 13.23
13.21 Karya-karana-kartrtve, with regard to the source of body and organs: Karya is the body, and karana are the thirteen [Five sense organs, five motor organs, mind, intellect and ego.] organs existing in it. Here, by the word karya are understood the aforesaid elements that produce the body as also the objects which are modifications born of Nature. And since the alities-which are born of Nature and manifest themselves as happiness, sorrow and delusion-are dependent on the organs, (therefore) they are implied by the word karana, organs. The kartrtvam, (lit) agentship, with regard to these body and organs consists in being the source of the body and organs. With regard to this source of the body and organs, prakrtih, Nature; ucyate, is said to be; the hetuh, cause, in the sense of being the originator. Thus, by virtue of being the source of body and organs, Nature is the cause of mundane existence.
Even if the reading be karya-karana-kartrtva, karya (effect, modification) will mean anything that is the transformation of something; and karana (cause) will be that which becomes transformed. So the meaning of the compund will be: 'with regard to the source of the effect and the cause'.
Or, karya means the sixteen [The eleven organs (five sensory, five motor, and mind) and the five objects (sound etc.).] modificaitons, and karana means the seven [Mahat, egoism, and the five subtle elements.] transformations of Nature. They themselves are called effect and cuase. So far as the agentship with regard to these is concerned Nature is said to be the cause, because of the same reason of being their originator.
As to how the soul can be the cause of mundane existence is being stated: Purusah, the soul, the empirical being, the knower of the field-all these are synonymous; is the hetuh, cause; bhoktrtve, so far as enjoyership, the fact of being the perceiver; sukha-duhkhanam, of happiness and sorrow-which are objects of experience, is concerned.
How, again, is it asserted with respect to Nature and soul that, they are the causes of mundane existence by virtue of this fact of their (respectively) being the source of body and organs, and the perceiver of happiness and sorrow?
As to this the answer is being stated: How can there be any mundane existence if there be no modification of Nature in the form of body and organs, happiness and sorrow, and cause and effect, and there be no soul, the conscious being, to experience them? On the other hand, there can be mundane existence when there is a contact, in the form of ignorance, between Nature-modified in the form of body and organs, and cause and effect as an object of experience and the soul opposed to it as the experiencer. Therefore it was reasonable to have said that, Nature and soul become the cause of mundane existence by (respectively) becoming the originators of the body and organs, and the perceiver of happiness and sorrow.
What again is this that is called worldly existence? Worldly existence consists in the experience of happiness and sorrow; and the state of mundane existence of the soul consists in its being the experiencer of happiness and sorrow.
It has been asserted that the state of mundane existence of the soul consists in its being the experiencer of happiness and sorrow. How does it come about? This is being answered:
13.22 The soul seated in Nature experiences the alities born of Nature; attachment to the alities is the cause of its birth in good and evil wombs.
13.22 God dwelling in the heart of Nature experiences the Qualities which nature brings forth; and His affinity towards the Qualities is the reason for His living in a good or evil body.
13.22. For, the Soul, seated on the Material Cause, enjoys the Strands born of the Material Cause;  His attachment to the Strands is the cause for his births in the good and evil wombs.
13.22 (a) Indeed, the self seated in Prakrti experiences the Gunas born of Prakrti৷৷.

(b) ৷৷. Its attachment to these Gunas is the cause of birth in good and evil wombs.
13.22 Since the soul is seated in Nature, therefore it experiences the alities born of Nature. Contact with the alities is the cause of its births in good and evil wombs.
13.22 The self, settled in a series of bodies of divinities, men etc., which are modifications of Prakrti, becomes attached to happiness, pain etc., resulting from the Sattva and other alities associated with the respective wombs, and hence engages Itself in virtuous and sinful deeds, constituting the means for happiness, misery etc. In order to experience the fruits of those good and evil deeds, It is born again in good and evil wombs. Then It becomes active and conseently is born again as a result of Its activities. As long as It does not cultivate alities like modesty etc., which are the means for realising the self, so long Its entanglement in Samsara continues like this. Thus, it has been declared here that attachment causes births in good and evil wombs.
13.22 See Comment under 13.23
13.22 Hi, since; purusah, the soul, the experiencer; is prakrtisthah, seated in Nature, which is characterized as ignorance and gets transformed into body and organs, i.e., (since the soul) has become identified with Nature; therefore, bhunkte, [Bhunkte, lit. enjoys, here means 'experiences'.-Tr.] it enjoys, i.e. experiences; gunan, the alities-manifest as happiness, sorrow and delusion; prakrtijan, born of Nature, thinking thus, 'I am happy, sorrowful, deluded, learned.' Even though ignorance continues as a cause, still the main cause of worldly existence, of birth, is the contact, the self-identification, with the alities-happiness,sorrow, and delusion-when they are experienced, as is affirmed by the Upanisadic text, 'What it desires, it resolves' (Br. 4.4.5) [See Sankaracarya's Comm. on this.-Tr.].
That very fact is stated here: Gunasangah, contact with the alities; is karanam, the cause; asya, of its, the soul's, the experiencer's; sad-asad-yoni-janmasu, births in good and evil wombs. Self-identification with the alities is the cause of the experience of births in good and evil wombs. Or the meaning is, 'Self-identification with the alities is the cause or its worldly existence through birth in good and evil wombs,' where the words 'of worldly existence' have to be supplied. The good wombs are he wombs of gods and others; evil wombs are the wombs of gods and others; evil wombs are the wombs of beasts etc. From the force of the context it is to be understood that there is no contradiction in including even human wombs among 'good and evil wombs'.
It amounts to saying that ignorance-called 'being seated in Nature'-and the contact with. i.e. the desire for, the alities are the causes of worldly existence. And this is said so that they can be avoided. And in the scripture Gita it is a well-known fact that knowledge and dispassion, accompanied with renunciation, are the causes of removing this (ignorance and self-identification with the alities). That knowledge about the field and the Knower of the field, too, has been presented earlier. This has also been said in, '৷৷.by realizing which one attains Immortality' (12), etc., through the process of refutation of elements alien (to the Self) and superimposition of alities belonging to others (that are not the Self). [Verse 12 deals with the refutation of alien elements, and vere 13 with the superimposition of alities belonging to others.]
A direct presentation is again being made of that (knowledge) itself:
13.23 The Supreme Soul in this body is also called the spectator, the permitter, the supporter, the enjoyer, the great Lord and the Supreme Self.
13.23 Thus in the body of man dwells the Supreme God; He who sees and permits, upholds and enjoys, the Highest God and the Highest Self.
13.23. The Supreme Soul in this  [corporeal] body is called the Spectator, the Assentor, the Supporter, the Experiencer, the Mighty Lord and also the Supreme Self.
13.23 The self in the body is called spectator, approver, supporter, experiencer, the great lord and also the supreme self in the body.
13.23 He who is the Witness, the Permitter, the Sustainer, the Experiencer, the great Lord, and who is also spoken of as the transcendental Self is the supreme Person in this body.
13.23 The self existing in the body becomes the 'spectator and approver' of this body by means of the will in consonance with the functioning of the body. Likewise, It is the 'supporter' of the body, Similarly, It becomes 'experiencer' of the pleasure and pain resulting from the activities of the body. Thus, by virtue of ruling and supporting the body and by making the body completely subservient, It becomes 'the great lord' (Mahesvara) in relation to the body, the senses and the mind. Sri Krsna will further declare:  'When the lord acires the body, and when he leaves it and goes on his way, he takes these as the wind carries scents from their places' (15.8). In the body, It is said to be the 'supreme self' in relation to the body, the senses and the mind. The word 'self' (Atman) is applied to the body and the mind subseently. It is said afterwards:  'Some perceive the self by means of the self through meditation' (13.24). The particle 'also' (api) indicates that the self is the 'supreme lord'?  in relation to the body just as It is the supreme self. The supremacy of the self has been described in the text beginning with 'It is the beginningless brahman having Me for the Highest' (13.12). It is true that the self (in Its emancipated state) has limitless power knowledge. But It becomes the great lord and the supreme self only in relation to the body. Such lordship and supremacy is the result of attachment to the Gunas arising from the beginningless conjunction with Prakrti.
13.20-23 Prakrtim etc. upto parah.  The Material Cause also is beginningless, because it has no other casue.  Modifications : the cloth and the like.  What is known as Material Cause is the basis for the process of cause-and-effect.  But, the Soul, because of Its importance, constitutes the enjoyer.  [Thus] the Material Cause and the Soul have verily an existence of interdependence just as that of the lame and the blind.  Hence,  the nature of the  Soul is described by the authors of the scriptures by nomenclatures having different forms such as  'the Spectator' and so on.  The meaning, intended here is this : The Material Cause, Its modifications, the fourteen types of creation and also the Soul - this is all beginningless and  perennial as it is completely illuminated by the category Brahman and is identical with it.										
  Hence  [the Bhagavat] said :
13.23 He who is the upadrasta, Witness, who while staying nearby does not Himself become involved: As when the priests and the performer of a sacrifice remain engaged in duties connected with the sacrifice, there is another (called Brahma) remaining nearby who is unengaged, is versed in the science of sacrifices and witnesses the merit or demerit of the activities of the priest and the performer of the sacrifice, similarly, He who is not engaged in the activities of and is different from the body and organs, who has characteristics other than theirs, and is the proximate (upa) observer (drasta) of the body and organs engaged in their duties, is the upa-drasta. 
Or: The observers are the body, eyes, mind, intellect and the soul. Of them the body is the external observer. Proceeding inwards from that (body), the Self is the inmost as also the proximate observer, compared with which there is no other higher and inner observer. The Self, because of being the most proximate observer, is the upadrasta. Or, It is the upadrasta since, like the non-looker of a sarifice, It witness everything.
And He is the anu-manta, Permitter: Anumananam, approval, means satisfaction with those performers (viz body and organs) as also their perfomances. The agent of that (approval) is the anumanta. Or, He is the anumanta since, even though Himself not engaged in the activities of the body and organs, He appears to be favourably disposed towards and engaged in them. Or, He is the anumanta because, when the body and organs are engaged in their own functions, He remains as a witness and never dissuades them.
It is the bharta, Sustainer: Bharanam means the continuance in their own state of the body, organs, mind and intellect, which reflect consciousness and have become aggregated owing to the need of serving the purpose [Viz enjoyment, or Liberation.-Tr.] of some other entity, viz the conscious Self. And that (continuance) is verily due to the consciousness that is the Self. In this sense the Self is said to be the Sustainer.
It is the bhokta, Experiencer: As heat is by fire, similarly, the experiences of the intellect-in the form of happiness, sorrow and delusion in relation to all objects-, when born as though permeated by the consciousness that is the Self, are manifested differently by the Self which is of the nature of eternal Consciousness. In this sense the Self is said to be the Experiencer.
He is maheswarah, the great God, because, as the Self of all and independent, He is the great Ruler.
He is paramatma, the transcendental Self, because He is the Self which has the characteristics of being the supreme Witness etc. of (all) those-beginning from the body and ending with the intellect-which are imagined through ignorance to be the indwelling Self. He is api ca, also; uktah, spoken of, referred to, in the Upanisads; iti, as, with the words; 'He is the indwelling One, the paramatma, the transcendental Self.' [Ast reads atah in place of antah. So the translation of the sentence will be: Therefore He is also referred to as the transcendental Self in the Upanisads.-Tr.] Where is He? The parah, suprem; purusah, Person, who is higher than the Unmanifest and who will be spoken of in, 'But different is the supreme Person who is spoken of as the transcendental Self' (15.17); is asmin, in this; dehe, body.
What has been presented in, '৷৷.also understand Me to be the Knower of the field' (2), has been explained and conclude.
13.24 He who thus knows the Spirit and Matter together with the alities, in whatever condition he may be, he is not born again.
13.24 He who understands God and Nature along with her qualities, whatever be his condition in life, he comes not again to earth.
13.24. He who knows, in this manner, the Soul and the Material Cause together with Strands-he is not born again, even though he behaves in different ways.
13.24 He who understands the self and the Prakrti thus with the Gunas is not born again, in whatever state he may be placed.
13.24 He who knows thus the Person and Nature along with the alities will not be born again, in whatever way he may live.
13.24 He who 'understands', namely, knows truly with discrimination, the self to be thus, and also the Prakrti as having the aforesaid nature along with Sattva and other Gunas, whose nature will be later examined, is never born again, i.e., is never rorn conjointly with Prakrti again in 'whatever state he may be placed,' i.e., in whatever painful condition he may be placed in the bodies of divinities, men etc. The meaning is that at the time when the body ceases to exist, the self will attain the purified state characterised by boundless knowledge devoid of evil.
13.24 Ya evam etc.  a men of  Yoga who knows the Material Cause, the Soul, the Strands  and their modifications in this manner i.e., by means of  this above mentioned Brahman-perception which  is in the form  'All are identical with  It' - he is certainly emancipated eventhough he behaves in different ways i.e., in whatever manner [he chooses].
13.24 Sah yah, he who; vetti, knows, in the manner described; the purusam, Person, that Self possessed of the characteristics stated above, as 'I myself (am That)'; and knows prakrtim, Nature as described above, which is characterized as ignorance; to have been eradicated by Knowledge, saha, along with; gunaih, the alities which are its modifications; na abhijayate, will not be born; bhuyah, again-after the fall of this body of the man of realization, he does not become born again for (taking) another body, i.e. he does not take up another body; sarvatha api, in whatever way; vartamanah, he may live. From the word api it is understood that, it goes without saying that one who is firm in his own duty is not rorn.
Objection: Though it has been said that there is absence of rirth after the dawn of Knowledge, still is not illogical that actions done (in the present life) before the rise of Knowledge and those done subseently, as also those done in the many past lives, should be destroyed without yielding their results? Hence there should be three births! For destruction of acired merit is not logical, to the same extent as actions that have produced the present birth and are yielding their proper results (cannot be destroyed). Besides, it is not understood that actions have distinctions [Since all actions arise from ignorance, they are on the same level so far so they are opposed to Knowledge; i.e., there can be no such distinction among actions as 'those which have started yielding results' and 'those that have not'.]. Therefore, the actions of the three kinds, without exception, will produce three births or they all collectively will produce one birth. Otherwise, if the acired merits become destroyed, it will lead to loss of faith everywhere as well as to the purposelessness of scriptures. Therefore it has been illogical to say, 'he will not be born again.'
Reply: No, for the burning away of all the actions of the man of knowledge has been stated in hundreds of Upanisadic texts such as:
'And all one's actions become dissipated' (Mu. 2.2.8);
'Anyone who knows (that supreme) Brahman, becomes Brahman' (op. cit. 3.2.9);
'For him the delay is for so long only (as he does not become freed)' (Ch. 6.14.2); 
'As the fibres at the tip of a blade of reed (become completely burnt৷৷.,' so) all actions 'get completely burnt' (op. cit. 5.24.3).
Here too the burning of all actions has been stated in, 'as a blazing fire reduces pieces of wood to ashes,৷৷.'etc. (4.37), and He will also say so (later) [See 18.66: 'I shall free you from all sins,' etc.-Tr.].
This accords with reason also. Verily, actions, which arise from the seed of evils [Klesas, evils-see note under 8.19-Tr.] like ignorance and desires, germinate the sprout of rirth. Here also it has been said by the Lord in various places that actions which are associated with egoism and desire for results bear fruits, not the others. And there is also the verse: 'As seeds burnt by fire do not germinate, so also the Self does not acire another body due to evils that have been burnt by Knowledge (cf. Mbh. Va. 199. 107).
Objection: It may be granted for the present that actions performed after the rise of Knowledge are burnt by Knowledge, since they coexist with Knowledge. But the burning away of actions done in this life prior to the rise of Knowledge and those done in the many past lives is not reasonable.
Reply: No, because of the alification, 'all actions' (4.37).
Objection: May it not be that 'all actions' means those that are undertaken after Illumination?
Reply: No, for there is no reason for the restriction (of the meaning). On the other hand, as for the statement, 'just as actions that have produced the present birth and are already active in producing their results do not get dissipated even after Illumination, similarly it is not reasonable that actions which have not commenced producing their results should get dissipated,'-that is wrong.
Objection: Why?
Reply: Since they have already begun producing results, like an arrow that has been shot: As an arrow, freed earlier from a bow for hitting a target, even after piercing through the target comes to a stop only after falling down as a result of the dissipation of its initial momentum, similarly, actions that produced the (present) body verily continue, even after fulfilling the purpose of maintaining the body, to exist as before until the dissipation of their inherent tendencies. But, as that very arrow, when it has not acired the momentum, needed for action, when it has not been shot even though fixed on the bow, can be withdrawn, similarly, actions which have not begun yielding their results may be rendered unproductive by Knowledge, even while existing in their receptacle. [The internal organ bearing the reflection of Consciousness.] Hence, it is established that , it has been reasonable to state that on the fall of the present body of an enlightened person, 'He is not born again.'
Here are being presented these meditation etc. which are the alternative means for the realization of the Self:
13.25 Some by meditation behold the Self in the self by the self, others by the Yoga of knowledge, and still others by the Yoga of action.
13.25 Some realise the Supreme by meditating, by its aid, on the Self within, others by pure reason, others by right action.
13.25. [However] by means of meditation, certain persons (Yogis) perceive the Self as the Self in the self (the heart etc.); others by the knowledge-Yoga; and others by the action-Yoga.
13.25 Some perceive the self within the self (body) by meditation by the self (mind), others by Sankhya Yoga, and still others by Karma Yoga.
13.25 Through meditation some realize the Self in (their) intellect with the help of the internal organ; others through Sankhya-yoga, and others through Karma-yoga.
13.25 The different type of Yogis are described herein:

(1) Some with perfect Yoga perceive the self (Atmanam) in the body with the mind (Atmana) by meditation. (2) Others with imperfect Yoga see the self, with mind rendered fit for Yoga, by Sankhya Yoga, namely, Jnana Yoga, (3) Still others, (a) unalified to practise Jnana Yoga, and (b alified but preferring an easier method, and (c) also distinguished persons like Janaka - all these perceive the self after being alified for Yoga by Karma Yoga which contains within itself knowledge (Jnana).
13.25 See Comment under 13.26
13.25 Dhyanena, through meditation: Meditation means contemplation (on the Self) after withdrawing into the mind with concentration the organs of hearing etc. from the objects like sound etc., and then withdrawing the mind into the indwelling conscious Self. Thus, from the citation of such illustrations as, 'the crane meditates, as it were, 'the earth meditates, as it were; the mountains meditate, as it were' (Ch. 7.6.1), it follows that meditation is a constant and uninterrupted current of thought like a line of pouring oil. Through that meditation, kecit, some yogis; pasyanti, realize; the indwelling conscious atmanam, Self; atmani, in (their) intellect; atmana, with the help of the internal organ that has been purified by meditation.
Anye, others; sankhyena yogena, through Sankhya-yoga: Sankhya means thinking, 'These alities, viz sattva, rajas and tamas, are objects of my perception; I am the Self, distinct from them, a witness of their functions, eternal and different from the alities.' This Sankhya is Yoga. [By Sankhya is meant that knowledge which arises from the foregoing reflection. This knowledge is itself called Yoga (concentration of mind) inasmuch as it is similar to Yoga in leading to the realization of the Self.] Through that they realize the Self with the help of the internal organ. This is how it is to be construed.
And anye, others; karma-yogena, through Karma-yoga-action itself being the Yoga: Action performed with the idea of dedication to God is figuratively called Yoga since it leads to Yoga. (others realize) with the help of that (action), through purification of the mind and rise of Knowledge. [The best among the yogis are competent for meditation (dhyana); the modiocre for reflection (Sankhya); and the lowest for Karma-yoga.]
13.26 Others also, not knowing thus, worship, having heard of It from others; they, too, cross beyond death, regarding what they have heard as the Supreme refuge.
13.26 Others again, having no direct knowledge but only hearing from others, nevertheless worship, and they, too, if true to the teachings, cross the sea of death.
13.26. But others, who have no knowledge of this nature, listen from others and practise reflection  [accordingly]  they too, being devoted to what they have heard, do cross over death.
13.26 But some, who do not know thus, having heard from others, worship accordingly - these too, who are devoted to what they hear, pass beyond death.
13.26 Others, agian, who do not know thus, take to thinking after hearing from others; they, too, who are devoted to hearing, certainly overcome death.
13.26 But some, namely, those who are not alified for Karma Yoga etc., for realising the self, listen to Jnanins who know the truth, and meditate on the self through Karma Yoga, etc. - they too pass beyond death. It means that those who are devoted to what they hear only, even they, intent on hearing and devoid of evils, begin in due course, the practice of Karma Yoga etc., and pass beyond death. By the term 'too' (api), the difference in levels is made out.

Now, in order to teach the contemplation on the distinctness of the self conjoined with the Prakrti, he says that all entities, movables and immovables, are the product of combination between the conscient and the non-conscient:
13.25-26 Dhyanena etc., Anye etc.  A  knowledge of this sort is the main.  [For this end]  some practise religious meditation of the Self as Self; others [try] by means of the Sankhya  (knowledge) mentioned already  (Ch. V, 5ff),  while still others  [strive] through action.  Still others, bent upon hearing [from the preceptors etc.]  practise the religious meditation as they have heard, even though they do not themselves know, (have) the knowledge of this kind.  They too cross over the death,  i.e., the cycyle of birth and death.  What is conveyed here is this :  The category Bhagavat, if mentally reflected upon by one means or the other, does transport across [the ocean of death circle]. Therefore , let one remain in this fashion by all means.
13.26 Anye tu, others again; ajanantah, who do not know the Self as described above; evam, thus, even in one of these alternative ways; upasate, take to thinking, take to reflection, being imbued with faith; srutva, after hearing; anyhyah, from others, from the teachers, having been told, 'Think only of this.' Te api ca, they, too; sruti-parayanah, who are devoted to hearing, to whom hearing is the supreme course, the best discipline for starting on the path to Liberation, i.e., those who, themselves lacking in discrimination, accept only others' advice as most authoritative; eva, certainly; ati-taranti, overcome; mrtyum, death, i.e. the mundane existence which is fraught with death.
The implication is; It goes without saying that those discriminating people who are idenpendent in the application of the valid means of knowledge, cross over death.
That the knowledge of the identity of the Knower of the field and God leads to Liberation has been stated in, '৷৷.by realizing which one attains Immortality' (12). For what reason is it so? To point out that reason the (next) verse is begun:
13.27 Wherever a being is born, whether unmoving or moving, know thou, O best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), that it is from the union between the field and its knower.
13.27 Wherever life is seen in things movable or immovable, it is the joint product of Matter and Spirit.
13.27. Whatever living being is born, stationary or moving, you should know that all this has a close connection with the Field and the Field-sensitizer,  O the best of the Bharatas !
13.27 Whatever being is born, whether it is moving or stationary, know, O Arjuna, that it is through the combination of the Ksetra (body) and Ksetrajna (knower of the Field).
13.27 O scion of the Bharata dynasty, whatever object, moving or non-moving, comes into being, know that to be from the association of the field and the Knower of the field!
13.27 Whatever being is born, whether it be movable or stationary, it is born only from the mutual combination of the Ksetra and Ksetrajna. The sense is that it is born only from this combination, i.e., is born as a compound of the two and never in their separateness.
13.27 Yavat etc.  Whatever is a thing, whether moving or unmoving - all this is born not as something altogether different from the Field and the Field-sensitizer.	
 Therefore -
13.27 Bharatarsabha, O scion of the Bharata dynasty; yavat kincit, whatever; sattvam, object;-as to whether they are without exception the Lord says-sthavara-jangamam, moving or non-moving; sanjayate, comes into being; viddhi, know; tat, that; as originating ksetra-ksetrajna-samyogat, from the association of the field and the Knower of the field.
Objection: What, again, is meant by this 'association of the field and the Knower of the field'? Since the Knower of the field is partless like space, therefore Its conjunction with the field cannot be a kind of relationship like coming together of a rope and a pot through the contact of their parts. Nor can it be an intimate and inseparable relation as between a thread and a cloth, since it is not admitted that the field and the Knower of the field are mutually related by way of being cause and effect.
Reply: The answer is: The association of the field and the Knower of the field-which are the object and the subject, respectively, and are of different natures-is in the form of superimposition of each on the other an also of their alities, as a conseence of the absence of discrimination between the real natures of the field and the Knower of the field. This is like the association of a rope, nacre, etc. with the superimposed snake, silver, etc. owing to the absence of discrimination between them. This association of the field and the Knower of the field in the form of superimposition is described as false knowledge. After having known the distinction between and the characteristics of the field and the Knower of the field according to the scriptures, and having separated, like a stalk from the Munjagrass, the above-described Knower of the field from the field whose characteristics have been shown earlier, he who realizes the Knowable (i.e. the Knower of the field)-which, in accordance with 'That is neither called being nor non-being' (12), is devoid of all distinctions created by adjuncts- as identical with Brahman; and he who has the firm realization that the field is surely unreal like an elephant created by magic, a thing seen in a dream, an imaginary city seen in the sky, etc., and it appears as though real-for him false knowledge becomes eradicated, since it is opposed to the right knowledge described above.
Since the cause of his rirth has been eliminated. therefore what was said in, 'He who knows thus the Person and Nature along with the alities৷৷.', that the man of realization is not born again (23), has been a reasonable statement. 
In 'He৷৷.will not be born again' (23) has been stated the result of right knowledge, which is the absence of birth owing to the destruction of ignorance etc., the seeds of worldly existence. The cause of birth, viz the association of the field and the Knower of the field brought about by ignorance, has also been stated. Hence, although right knowledge, which is the remover of that ignorance, has been spoken of, still it is being stated over again in other words:
13.28 He sees, who sees the Supreme Lord, existing eally in all beings, the unperishing within the perishing.
13.28 He who can see the Supreme Lord in all beings, the Imperishable amidst the perishable, he it is who really sees.
13.28. Whosoever perceives the Supreme Lord as abiding and as non-perishing in all beings alike, while they perish - he perceives properly.
13.28 Who sees the supreme ruler dwelling alike in all bodies and nevr perishing when they perish, he sees indeed.
13.28 He sees who sees the supreme Lord as existing eally in all beings, and as the Imperishable among the perishable.
13.28 He who sees the Atman as It really is - he is the one who sees the Atman as a distinct entity in all embodied beings that are composed of Prakrti and Purusa, even in bodies of diverse nature of gods, men etc. The true seer is one who sees the Atman as the supreme ruler in all these bodies as the imperishable self, though the bodies are subject to destruction. Conversely the purport is that he who sees the Atman, only as characterised by the uneal forms of the bodies as men, gods etc., and as possessed of birth, death etc. - such a person is perpetually caught up in transmigratory existence.
13.28 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
13.28 Sah, he; pasyati, sees; yah, who; pasyati, sees;-whom?-parameswaram, the supreme Lord-the Lord who is supreme as compared with the body, organs, mind, intellect, the Unmanifest and the individual soul; as tisthantam, existing, having His presence; samam, eally, without distinction;-where?-sarvesu, in all; bhutesu, beings, all living things from Brahma to the non-moving;-he who sees Him existing eally in all living things. The Lord specifies them by the word vinasyatsu, among the perishable; and He also specifies Him, the supreme Lord, by the word avinasyantam, the Imperishable. This is meant for showing the absolute difference between the living things and God. 
How?
For, all the modifications [See note 3 on p.38.-Tr.] of an existing thing have as their root that modification of an existing thing described as birth. All other modifications of existing things that follow birth end with destruction. After destruction there is no modification of an existing thing, because the object itself becomes nonexistent. Indeed, alities can exist so long as the thing alified exists. Therefore, by the reiteration of the absence of the last modification of an existing thing, all its preceding modifications become negated along with their effects. Hence it is established that the supreme Lord is very greatly different from all beings, and is also Unconditioned [Free from all modifications that things are subject to.] and One.
He sees who thus sees the supreme Lord as described.
Objection: Is it not that all poeple see? What is the need of specification?
Reply: True, they see; but they see contrarily! Hence the Lord specifies, 'He alone sees'. As in comparison with one who, suffering from the (eye) disease called Timira, sees many moons, the person who sees one moon is distingusihed by saying, 'He alone sees,' similarly, here as well, the man who sees the one undivided Self as described above is distinguished from those who contrarily see many and differentiated selves, by saying 'He alone sees'. Others, though seeing, do not see because they see contrarily like the person who sees many moons. This is the meaning.
The obove-described true knowledge has to be praised by stating its result. Hence the verse begins:
13.29 Because he who sees the same Lord eally dwelling everywhere does not destroy the Self by the self; he goes to the highest goal.
13.29 Beholding the Lord in all things equally, his actions do not mar his spiritual life but lead him to the height of Bliss.
13.29. Whosoever, perceiving the Lord as abiding in all alike, does not harm the Self by the Self-he attains, on that account, the Supreme Goal.
13.29 For, seeing the ruler (i.e., self) abiding alike in every place, he does not injure the self by the self (mind) and therefore reaches the highest goal.
13.29 Since by seeing eally God who is present alike everywhere he does not injure the Self by the Self, therefore he attains the supreme Goal.
13.29 'The ruler' (the self) abides in the bodies of divinities and the rest as their supporter, controller and as their Sesin (principal). He who sees the self free from dissimilar shapes of divinities etc., and as being of the same form of knowledge, he does not injure himself by 'himself', namely, by his mind. Therefore, as a result of seeing the sameness of the nature of the self in every place as a knower, he attains the 'highest goal.' What is to be reached is called 'goal'. He attains the supreme, namely, the self in its pure form. On the contrary, if he should view the self as dissimilar in every place, i.e., identifies It with the bodies, then he 'injure the self, namely, hurls It into the middle of the ocean of Samsara.
13.29 Samam etc.  A man of Yoga, who's thought is on what is eal in one and all, does not harm the Self i.e, does not fell the Self down in the ocean of the cycle  [of birth and death], difficult to cross over.
13.29 Hi, since; pasyan, by seeing, by realizing; samam, eally; isvaram, God, i.e., (by realizing Him) as described in the immediately preceding verse; who is samavasthitam, present alike; sarvatra, everywhere, in all beings;-what follows from seeing eally?-he na, does not; hinasti, injure; his own atmanam, Self; atmana, by the Self, by his own Self; tatah, therefore, as a result of that non-injuring; yati, he attains; the param, supreme; gatim, Goal, called Liberation.
Objection: Is it not that no creature whatsoever injures himself by himself? Why do you refer to an irrelevant thing by saying, 'He does not injure৷৷.,which is like saying, 'Fire should neither be lit on the earth nor in the sky,' etc.?
Reply: This defect does not arise, because it is logical with reference to an unenlightened person's ignoring the Self. For, all unillumined people ignore the very wellknown Self which is manifest and directly perceptible, and regard the non-Self as the Self. By performing righteous and unrighteous acts they destroy even that self which has been accepted, and adopt another new self. And destroying even that, they take up another. Similarly, destroying even that, they adopt another. In this way they destroy the self that had been accepted successively. Thus, all unillumined persons are destroyers of the Self. But that which is the Self in reality, even that remains as though destroyed for ever by ignorance, because of the absence of any benefit from Its presence. So, all unenlightened persons are, verily, destroyers of the Self.
On the contrary, the other person who has realized the Self as described does not injure in either way [i.e. either through superimposition or through non-super-imposition.] the Self by his own Self. Therefore he attains the supreme Goal, i.e., the result stated above comes to him.
Lest it be doubted that what was said in, 'seeing eally God who is present in all beings, he does not injure the Self by the Self, is improper with regard to the selves which are diverse according to the differences created by the variety in their own alities and actions, the Lord says:
13.3 Do thou also know Me as the knower of the field in all fields, O Arjuna. Knowledge of both the field and the knower of the field is considered by Me to be ï1the ï1 knowledge.
13.3 I am the Omniscient self that abides in the playground of Matter; knowledge of Matter and of the all-knowing Self is wisdom.
13.3. O descendant of Bharata !  You should know Me to be also the Field-sensitizer in the Fields of all.  The knowledge of the Field and the Field-sensitizer-that knowledge is  [in fact]  the understanding of  Me.
13.3 And know Me also as the Field-Knower in all Fields, O Arjuna. The knowledge of the Field and its knower is, in My view, the true knowledge.
13.3 And, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, under-stand Me to be the 'Knower of the field' in all the fields. In My opinion, that is Knowledge which is the knowlege of th field and the knower of the field.
13.3 Know as Myself the Field-knower also who is the only form of the Knower in all the bodies like divinities, men etc., i.e., know them as ensouled by Me. By the expression 'also' (Api) in, 'Know Me also (Api) as the Field-Knower,' it is inferable that 'Know Me as the Field-Knower in all Fields' has also been taught by implication. Just as the body, on account of its being the attribute of the knower, cannot exist separately, and is conseently denoted by way of co-ordinate predication (Samanadhikarnya) with it, in the same manner both the Field and the Field-Knower, on account of their being My attributes, cannot exist as entities separate from Me, and hence can be denoted as 'one with Me' by way of co-ordinate predication.

Both the Ksetra (Field) which is an aggregate of earth etc., and the Ksetrajna (the Jiva) have the Lord for their Self, because of their being of the nature of the body of the Lord. Such is the teaching of the Sruti passages beginning from 'He who dwelling in the earth, is within the earth, whom the earth does not know, whose body is the earth, who controls the earth from within - He is your inner Controller and immortal Self' (Br. U., 3.7.3), and ending with 'He who, dwelling in the individual self as the self within, whom the self does not know, whose body the self is, who controls the self from within - He is your inner Controller and immortal Self' (Br. U. Madh., 3.7.22). It is the dwelling in of the Lord as the Self of all the knowers of the bodies (Field-Knowers or the Jivas) on account of His being the inner Controller, that is the justification for describing Him as in co-ordinate predication (Samanadhikaranya) with them.

In the beginning and later on, it was taught to the effect, 'I am the self, O Arjuna, dwelling in the hearts of all beings' (10.20), and 'Nothing that moves or does not move exists without Me' (10.39) and 'I, with a single aspect of Myself, am sustaining the whole universe' (10.42). In the middle He describes Himself by way of co-ordinate predication as, 'Of Adityas, I am Visnu' etc. In the teachings concerning the difference between the body and its knower and concerning both of them as having Me for their Self - this knowledge of unity by co-ordinate predication alone is taught as 'My view.'

Some (the followers of Advaita and Bhedabheda) say:  The sentence 'And know Me as the Knower' should be understood as co-ordinate predication expressing identity between the individual self and the Supreme Self. Thus according to their view, the Lord (Isvara), who is Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute must be admitted to have become the individual self, as it were, through nescience (Ajnana). According to their docrine the teaching of identity given here in the Text seeks to sublate that nescience. Just as teaching by a reliable person to the effect, 'This is a rope, and not a snake,' sublates the erroneous notion of a snake, the teaching of the Lord, who is most reliable, sublates the erroneous notion of the individual self (Ksetrjna) being different from Him.

Such interpreters are to be estioned thus:  Is this Teacher, Bhagavan Vasudeva, the Supreme Ruler, one whose nescience has been sublated by the exact knowledge of the Self or not?  If His nescience has been sublated, then the perception of duality like Arjuna as the taught, and of actions like teaching, becomes impossible, because of the impossibility of superimposing a flase form on the Self which is in reality mere undifferentiated Consciousness. If, however, His nescience has not been sublated on account of His not having realised the Self, then, because of His ignorance, it is utterly impossible for Him to teach the knowledge of the Self. Elsewhere it has been stated:  'The wise, who have realised the truth, will instruct you in knowledge' (4.34). Thus, the polemics of this nature are to be ignored as having been set forth to misguide the world by these ignorant daters whose arguments are contradicted by all Vedas, Smrtis, Itihasas, the Puranas, logic and their own words.

The truth is this:  Some of the Sruti texts declare that non-conscient matter, the conscient entity (the individual self) and the Supreme Brahman are different in nature from one another in the relation of object of enjoyment, the enjoyer (subject) and the Supreme Ruler as follows:  'From Prakrti, the Possessor of Maya projects this world, in which another (i.e. the individual self) is confined by Maya (Sve. U., 4.9); 'Know then Maya to be the Prakrti and the Possessor of Maya to be the Great Lord' (Sve. U., 4.10); 'The perishable is Prakrti; the immortal and imperishable is Hara (the individual self); and the Lord alone rules over both the perishable Prakrti and the imperishable individual self' (Sve. U., 1.10). Here, the expression, 'The immortal and the imperishable is Hara,' points out the enjoyer (i.e., individual self); It is called Hara because the individual self siezes matter as an object of It own experience.

Again, 'He is the cause, the Lord of the lord of senses' (Ibid., 6.9); 'He has no progenitor and no Lord' (Ibid., 6.9); 'He is the ruler of Prakrti, of the individual self, and the Lord of alities' (Ibid., 6.16); 'He is the Lord of the Universe, the Ruler of individual selves, the eternal, the auspicious and the unchanging' (Ma. Na., 13.3); 'The two unborn - the knowing Lord and the unknowing individual self, the omnipotent and the impotent' (Sve. U.,1.9); 'The Constant among inconstants, the Intelligent among the intelligents, the one who grants the desires of the many' (Ibid., 6.13. & Ka. U., 5.13); 'When one knows the enjoyer, the object of enjoyment and Actuater ৷৷.' (Sve. U., 1.12); 'Regarding the individual self and the Actuater to be different, and blessed by Him, It attains immortality' (Ibid., 1.6), and 'Ot these two, the one eats the sweet Pippala fruit, the other shines in his splendour without eating' (Ibid., 4.6 and Mun. U., 3.1.1).

Further, 'There is one unborn female, red, white and black, who produces many creatures like herself; there is another unborn being who loves her and is close to her; there is yet another male unborn who after having enjoyed here, gives her up' (Ibid., 4.5); 'The cow (i.e. Prakrti) that has no beginning or end, is the mother and source of all beings' (Cha. U., 4.5) and 'On the self-same tree, the individual self sits sunken in grief, and being ignorant and impotent, It grieves. When It sees the other, the gracious Lord and His glory, It attains freedom from grief (Sve. U., 4.7).

The following passages of the Gita are alos to the point:  'This Prakrti, thus divided eightfold, composed of Ahankara etc., is Mine.' 'This is My lower Prakrti. Know My higher Prakrti to be distinct from this - the Life Principle, by which the universe is sustained (7.4-5); 'All beings, O Arjuna, enter into My Nature at the end of a cycle. These I send forth again at the beginning of a cycle. Resorting to Prakrti, which is My own, I send forth again and again all this multitude of beings, helpless under the sway of Prakrti' (9.7-8); 'Under my control, Prakrti gives birth to all that moves, and that which does not move. And because of this, O Arjuna, does the world spin' (9.10); 'Know that Prakrti and the individual self are without beginning' (13.19) 'The great Brahman (or Prakrti) is My womb; in that I lay the germ; from it, O Arjuna, is the birth of all beings' (14.3). The great Brahman of Mine, which is the womb of this world, called Prakti, non-conscient matter, consisting of elements in a subtle state - in it I lay the germ called conscient entity. From that, namely, from the compound between conscient and unconscient entities, which is willed by Me, are born all these beings beginning with the gods and ending with the immobile things mixed up with the unconscient matter. Such is the meaning. In the Sruti also, the subtle original state of material elements is signified as Brahman:  'From Him are produced Brahman as also the world of matter and soul (Anna) having name and form' (Mun. U., 1.1.9).

Likewise, Sruti Texts declare that the Supreme Person constitutes the Self of all, and the conscient and non-conscient entities are inseparable from Him; for, those conscient and unconscient entities, which abide in the form of the experiencer and the experienced abiding in all states, form the body of the Supreme Person; conseently they are under His control. These Texts are as follows:  'He who, dwelling in the earth, is within the earth, whom the earth does not know, whose body the earth is, who is the Inner Ruler of the earth' and ending with, 'He who, dwelling in the self, is within the self, whom the self does not know, whose body the self is and who is the Inner Controller of the self' (Br. U. Madh., 3.7.3-22). Likewise another passage declares:  'He who is moving withing the earth, to whom the earth is the body, whom the earth does not know ৷৷. he who is moving within the Mrtyu (Nature), to whom Mrtyu is the body, whom Mrtyu does not know ৷৷. He is the Inner Self of all beings, sinless; He is the divine Lord, He is of the one Narayana' (Sub. U., 7). Here the term Mrtyu denotes the subtle state of non-conscient entity which is expressed by the term Tamas, because in the same Upanisad, it is declared, 'The unmanifest (Avyakta) merges into Aksara (the imperishable), and the Aksara merges into Tamas (Ibid., 2). Elsewhere it is stated thus:  'Entering within, is the Ruler of all creatures, the self of all (Tai. A., 3.21).

Therefore, the Supreme Person, who posseses conscient and non-conscient entities abiding in all states as His body, is in the form of the world, whether in the state of cause or of effect. So, with the purpose of making this explicit, some Srutis declare that the world in its states as cause and effect, is He Himself. They begin with, 'This Existence (Sat) alone was in the beginning, one only without a second ৷৷. It thought, "May I become many, may I multiply". It creates Tejas' (Cha. U., 6.2.1.2), and ends with 'All creatures here, my dear, have their root in the Sat (Being), have their home in the Sat, have Sat as their support. All this has Sat for its self. That is Existence. He is the Self. That you are, O Svetaketu' (Cha. U., 6.8.4.6-7). Elsewhere is the following text beginning with, 'He desired, "May I become many"; He performed austerity; having performed austerity, He created all this,' and concluding with, 'He became both the Satya (individual self) and Anrta (matter), He has remained true to His nature' (Tai. U., 2.6.1).

The difference in nature between conscient and unconscient entities and the Supreme Person, established in the other Sruti passages, is asserted here also:  'Lo! Entering into these three divinities (i.e. the Tejas, water and earth) in the form of living self (individual self), which is Myself, I distinguish name and form?  (Cha. U., 6.3.2) and also in the text, 'Having created it, He entered into it. Having entered it, He became Sat and Tyat ৷৷. He became both conscious and unconscious, both the Satya (individual self) and Anrta (matter). He has remained true to His own nature' (Tai. U., 2.6.1). It is in this way that all the distinctions of names and forms are brought about:  The Sruti also declares, 'Then, this was undifferentiated. Now, it has been differentiated by names and forms' (Br. U., 1.4.7).

Therefore, He who exists in the states of effect and cause, and who has the conscient and unconscient entities in their gross and subtle states as His body, is the Supreme Person. Because the effect is not other than the cause, the effect becomes known when the cause is known, when the One becomes known, everything is known - thus what is posited by the Srutis stands explained. In the text, 'Entering into these three divinities by way of living self (individual self) which is My self, I distinguish name and form' (Cha. U., 6.3.2) - all the non-conscient entities are pointed out by the expression, 'the three divinities', and then the distinguishing of names and forms arises on account of the individual selves having Him for Their Self, entering into those entities. Thus all expressive terms signify the Supreme Self who is alified by the individual selves and non-conscient matter. Therefore, co-ordinate predication (Samanadhikaranya) of a term denoting an effect with a term denoting the Supreme Self as cause, is ite appropriate.

Thus the Supreme Brahman, who has conscient and non-conscient entities in their gross and subtle conditions as His modes, is Himself the effect and the cause; so Brahman is the material cause of the world. Brahman Himself constitutes the material cause of the world, because Brahman, who has the conscient and unconscient entities in their subtle state as His body, forms the cause of all. Still as that material cause is a composite entity (i.e., of individual selves, Prakrti aand Isvara), there is no mixing up of the natures of Brahman, conscient entities and non-conscient entities. This is perfectly tenable.

Thus, for example, although the material cause of a multi-coloured cloth is a combination of white, black and red threads, the connection of whiteness etc., with the cloth is to be found only in the place where a particular kind of thread is woven in it; in the state of effect also, there is no mixing up of the colours everywhere. Similarly, although the world has for its material cause a combination of the Lord, conscient and non-conscient entities, still in its condition as an effect also, there is no mixing up of the respective alities of experiencer (subject), the experienced (object) and the Controller (God). Though these threads can exist separately they are brought together at a time by man's will and acire the character and effect as a conseence. But in the case of the world manifestation, there is a unieness. It consists in that the intelligent and insentient entities in both causal and effect conditions derive their existential nature only from, and as, modes of the Supreme Person, by forming His body. Thus the Supreme Person having those entities as His body, is always signified by all these terms indicating them. As for the differences in nature, their respective speciality of character holds good here (i.e., in the production of world as of the coloured cloth).

Such being the case, though the Supreme Brahman enters the effect, owing to absence of transformation of His nature, the unchangeability is well established. To signify Brahman as effect is also very appropriate, because He is the Self sustaining the conscient and non-conscient entities from within their gross condition when they are differentiated by name and form:  What is called effect is nothing other than the cause passing into another state of existence.

The various scriptural statements that the Supreme Brahman is without attributes are also tenable in the sense that He is not associated with evil attributes, as the Sruti text, 'He is free from evil, ageless, deathless, sorrowless, hungerless, thirstless' eliminates all evil attributes, and then says that He is full of auspicious attributes:  'Whose desire is real, whose will is real' (Cha. U., 8.7.1). This Sruti text itself settles here what was generally declared elsewhere that negation of attributes (Guna-nisedha) pertains to evil attributes in Brahman.

The doctrine that Brahman is of the nature of knowledge is also ite appropriate, because it amounts to saying that the true nature of Brahman, who is omniscient and omnipotent, who is antagonistic to all that is evil, and who is the mine of all auspicious attributes, can be adeately defined only as Knowledge, as one whose nature is Knowledge, since He possesses self-luminosity. The following texts teach that Brahman is the Knower:  'He who is all-knowing, all wise' (Mun. U., 1.1.9); 'His high power is revealed, indeed, as various and natural, as consisting of knowledge, strength and activity' (Sve.U., 6.8); 'My dear, by what means has one to understand the Knower?'  (Br. U., 2.4.14); and the text, 'Brahman is Existence, Knowledge and Infinity' (Tai. U., 2.1.1). All these teach that Brahman is of the nature of Knowledge in as much as He can be defined only as Knowledge, and because also He is self-luminous.

In the texts 'He desired, "May I become many" ' (Tai. U., 2.6.1), 'It thought, "May I become many" ' (Cha. U., 6.2.3), 'It became differentiated by names and forms' - it is affirmed that Brahman thus exists of His own Will in a wonderful plurality of modes on account of His having the immovable and movable entities as His body. Conseently it is false to affirm the opposite view that the manifold entities do not have Brahman as their self in a real sense.

Thus, it is the unreality of manifold existence (i.e., of entities without Brahman for the Self) that is denied in the following texts:  'He obtains death after death who sees difference here' (Ka. U., 2.4.10), 'There is nothing here that is manifold' (Ka. U., 2.4.11), 'But where there is duality, as it were, there one sees another ৷৷. but where everything has become the self ৷৷. there, by what can one see what ৷৷. who shall know which by what?'  (Br. U., 4.5.15). There is also no denial of the manifoldness of modes of the Brahman resulting from His assumption of various names and forms by His will. This is established in Sruti texts such as, 'May I become manifold' (Tai. U., 2.6.1 and Cha. U., 6.2.3) etc. This manifold modality is proved to be existent in the commencement of even that passage which negates multiplicity by asserting. 'But where everything has become the self' (Br. U., 4.5.15). 'Everything deserts Him who knows everything to be apart from Him' (Br. U., 4.5.7), and 'Lo, verily, from this great Being has been breathed forth that which is Rg veda' (Ibid., 2.4.10).

Thus there is no contradiction whatsoever among the Srutis which assert difference in essence and in nature between the conscient self, non-conscient matter and the Lord, whose body the former entities are. There is no contradiction also in the scriptural statement that they are identical. The relation of the body and the self exists at all times between the Lord and the conscient and non-conscient entities. The Sruti texts themselves establish that those entities, which constitute the body (of the Lord), acire in causal condition, a subtle state, in which they cannot be differentiated. In the effect condition they are in a gross state with names and forms, and are capable of differentiation into a multiplicity of entities as modes of the Supreme.

Thus there is no room whatsoever for entertaining such doctrines which ascribe nescience to Brahman (as in Advaita), for describing the differences in Brahman as due to limiting adjuncts (as in Bhedabheda) and other tenets (Yadavaprakasa's). All these proceed from unsound logic and are in viloation of all Srutis. Let this over-long polemic be terminated here.

The object of this long polemical passage is to refute the Advaitic interpretation of the statement Know the Field-Knower in all bodies as Myself' as one of absolute identity between the Jiva and Isvara. The thesis of the author of the commentary is that the relation is not oneof absolute identity but only one of identity of reference of several inseparable entities to a comon substratum known technically as Samandadhikaranya or co-ordinate predication, also translated sometimes as grammatical co-ordination. The literal meaning of the expression is 'the relation of abiding in a common substratum.' The relation of the Jiva and Prakrti to Isvara is as of body and soul or as a mode (Prakara) and its substratum (Prakari). The relation between the body and soul of an ordinary being is, however, separable at death. But it is inseparable in the case of Isvara and this Jiva-cum-Prakrti body. In this sense Isvara is the Field-knower (Ksetrajna) of the Field (Ksetra) constituted of all individual entities conscient and inconscient, just as in each individual personality the Jiva and the body are the field-knower and the field respectively.  [Being in co-ordinate predication (Samanadhikaranya), Brahman is an inseparable but mutually distinct complex of Prakrti, Jiva and Isvara. The cosmic mode of body constituted of Prakrti and Purusa is at intervals in alternate states of latency and patency (Pralaya and Srsti or dissolution and manifestation). As the soul of a complex whole, He can be denoed by any of the terms entering into it - Isvara, Prakrti or Jiva. Brahan is sometimes mentioned in the Srutis as Asat when everything is in latency in Pralaya, and as Sat when all entities are in manifestations (Srsti). All these expressions denote Him only. He is described in some texts as attributeless. It means only that He is without any undesriable evil alities. He is on the other hand endowed with countless auspicious attributes.

All these contentions are supported by numerous Vedic passages, which are oted in the commentary.]
13.2-3 Somewhere in  the scriputures it is heard that 'The  Field-sensitizer must be worshipped'.  Is He the same as the Soul, or the Lord or an altogether different third entity ?  On a doubt regarding this problem -
 
The Bhagavat instructs-Idam etc.  Ksetrajnam etc.  For persons of wordly life their body  is the Ksetra  'Field'  where the seeds of action grow.  That is why their personal  Soul covered with incoming  (or foreign, not-natural)  dirt, is called Field-sensitizer. In the case of the enlightened persons, the self-same body is  [again]  the Ksetra,  But there is difference in etimological meaning viz :  It decays  the fetters of the result of action by means of consuming [it];  and it protects  [them] from the fear of birth-and-death  [cycle].  With reference to these  persons, the Supreme Soul, Vasudeva is the Field-sensitizer.  He who sensitizes this Field :  He who causes it to know.  Here the root vid includes within itself,  the meaning of the causal  suffix ni.  Therefore  [the meaning is :]  He, on account of Whose grace this insentient [body] attains the status of being sentient, He alone, an no one else, is the Field-sensitizer.  But, the  [only]  difference is this :  Taking into consideration th aspect of limited pervaisveness,  He is taken to be Soul; and on account of  [His] unlimited pervasiveness in all the Fields,  [He is called] the Supreme Soul, the Bhagavat  Vasudeva.  Of  Me :  the Sixth Case here is in the objective sense.  Hence the idea is :  I may be known by means  of  this knowledge.
13.3 Ca api, and; viddhi, understand; mam, Me, the supreme God who is transcendental; to be the ksetrajnam, 'Knower of the field' with the characterisitics noted above; sarva-ksetresu, in all the fields. The idea is this: Know the 'Knower of the field'- who has become diversified by limiting adjuncts in the form of numerous 'fields' ranging from Brahma to a clump of grass-as free from differentiations resulting from all the limiting adjuncts, and as beyond the range of such words and ideas as existece, nonexistence, etc.
O scion of the Bharata dynasty, since there remains nothing to be known apart from the true nature of the field, the knower of the field and God, therefore; tat, that; is jnanam, Knowledge, right knowledge; yat, which; is the jnanam, knowledge; ksetra-ksetrajnayoh, of the field and the knower of the field-which are the two knowables-, and by which Knowledge the field and the knower of the field are made objects of knowledge. This is mama, My, God Vishu's; matam, opinion.
Objection: Well, if it be that in all the field there exists God alone, and none else other than Him, as the enjoyer, then God will become a mundane being; or, due to the absence of any mundane creature other than God, there will arise the contingency of the negation of mundance existence. And both these are undesirable, since the scriptures dealing with bondage, Liberation and their causes will become useless, and also becuase they contradict such valid means of knowledge as direct perception.
In the first place, mundane existence which is characterized by happiness, sorrow and their cause is apprehended through direct perception. Besides, from the perception of variety in the world it can be inferred that mundane existence results from virtue and vice. All this becomes illogical if God and the individual soul be one.
Reply: No, because this becomes justifiable owing to the difference between Knowledge and ignorance. 'These two, viz that which is know as Knowledge and that which is known as ignorance are widely contradictory, and they follow divergent courses' (Ka. 1.2.4.); and similarly, the different results, viz Liberation and enjoyment, belonging (respectively) to those Knowledge and ignorance, have also been pointed out to be contrary by saying that Liberation is the goal of Knowledge, and enjoyment is the result of ignorance (see Ka. 1.2.2). Vyasa, also has said so: 'Now, there are these two paths' (Mbh Sa. 241.6) etc. and, 'There are only these two paths,' etc. Here (in the Gita) also, two kinds of steadfastness have been stated. And it is understood from the Vedas, the Smrtis and reason that ignorance together with its effects has to be destroyed by Knowledge.
As for the Vedic texts, they are:
'If one has realized here, then there is truth;
if he has not realized here, then there is great destruction' (Ke. 2.5);
'Knowing Him in this way, one becomes Immortal here' (Nr. Pu. 6);
'There is no other path to go by' (Sv. 3.8); 
'The enlightened man is not afraid of anything' (Tai. 2.9.1).
On the other hand, (the texts) with regard to the unenlightened person are:
'Then, he is smitten with fear' (Tai. 2.7.1);
'Living in the midst of ognorance' (Ka. 1.2.5); 
One who knows Brahman becomes Brahman indeed. In his line is not born anyone who does not know Brahman' (Mu. 3.2.9);
'(While he who worships another god thinking,)
"He is one, and I am another," does not know.
He is like an animal to the gods' (Br. 1.4.10).
He who is a knower of the Self, 'He becomes all this (Universe)' (Br. 1.4.10); 'When men will fold up space like (folding) leather, (then) there will be cessation of sorrow, without knowing the Deity' (Sv. 6.9). There are thousands of texts like these.
And the Smrti texts (from the Gita) are:
'Knowledge remains covered by ignorance.
Thery the creatures become deluded' (5.15);
'Here itself is rirth conered by them whose minds are established on sameness' (5.19); 
'Since by seeing eally the God who is present alike everywhere (he does not injure the Self by the Self, therefore he attains the supreme Goal)' (13.28), etc.
And as for reason, there is the text, 'Men avoid snakes, tips of kusa-grass as also well when they are aware of them. Some fall into them owing to ignorance. Thus, see the special result arising from knowledge' (Mbh. Sa. 201.17).
Similarly, it is known that an unelightened person, who identifies himself with the body etc. and who practises righteousness and unrighteousness under the impulsion of attachment and aversion, takes birth and dies. It cannot be reasonably denied by anyone that, those who see the Self as different from the body etc. become liberated as a result of the cessation of righteous and unrighteous conduct, which depends on the destruction of attachment and aversion.
The being so, the Knower of the field, who is reality is God Himself, appears to have become a mundane soul owing to the various adjuncts which are products of ignorance; as for instance the individual soul becomes identified with the body etc. For it is a well-known fact in the case of all creatures that their self-identify with the body etc. which are not-Self is definitely caused by ignorance. Just as, when a stump, of a tree is firmly regarded as a man, the alities of a man do not thery come to exist in the stump, nor do the alities of the stump come to the person, similarly the property ofconsciousness does not come to the body, nor those of the body to consciousness. It is not proper that the Self should be identified with happiness, sorrow, delusion, etc., since they, like decrepitude and death, are eally the products of ignorance.
Objection: May it not be said that this is not so, becuase of dissimilarity? The stump and the man, which are verily objects of perception, are superimposed on each other through ignorance by their perceiver. On the other hand, in the case of the body and the Self,, the mutual superimposition occurs verily between a knower and an object of perception. Thus, the illustration is not eally applicable. Therefore, may it not be that the properties of the body, though objects of knowledge, belong to the Self which is the knower?
Reply: No, since there arises the contingency of (the Self) becoming devoid of consciousness! If alities such as happiness, sorrow, delusion, desire, etc. of the body etc., which are the field and are objects of knowledge, indeed belong to the knower, then it will be necessary to explain the particular reason why some of the alities of the object of knowledge-the field-superimposed through ignorance belong to the Self, while decrepitude, death, etc. do not. (On the contrary) it is possible to infer that they (happiness etc.) do not pertain to the Self, since, like decrepitude etc., they are superimposed on the Self through ignorance, and because they are either avoidable or acceptable.
This being so, the mundane state, consisting of agentship and enjoyership pertaining to the objects of knowledge, is superimposed on the knower through ignorance. Hence, nothing of the knower is affected thery-in the same way as nothing of the sky is affected by the superimposition of surface, diret, etc. (on it) by fools. Such being the case, not the least touch of the mundane state is to be apprehended with regard to the almighty [see footnote on p.5, and p.168.] God, the Knower of the field, even though He exists in all the fields. For it is nowhere seen in the world that anybody is benefitted or harmed by a ality attributed to him through ignorance.
As for the statement that the illustration is not eally applicable-that is wrong.
Objection: How?
Reply: Because what is intended as common between the illustration and the thing illustrated is merely the superimposition through ignorance. There is no disagreement as to that. However, as for your contention that the illustration fails with regard to the Knower, that too has been shown to be inapt by citing the example of decrepitude etc. [If it be held that objects of experience may be superimposed on one another, but they cannot be superimposed on the experiencer, the answer is that this cannot be a universal proposition. For decrepitude and death, which are matters of experience, are superimposed on the Self, the experiencer.]
Objection: May it not be that the Knower of the field becomes a mundane being owing to his having ignorance?
Reply: No, because ignorance is of the nature of tamas. Since ignorance has the nature of covering, it is indeed a notion born of tamas; it makes one perceive contrarily, or it arouses doubt, or it leads to non-perception. For it disappears with the dawn of discrimination. And the three kind of ignorance, viz non-perception etc. [Etc: false perception and doubt.], are experienced when there are such defects as blindness etc. which are forms of tamas and have the nature of veiling. [It is known through the process of agreement and difference that false perception etc. arise from some defects,and they are not the alities of the Self.]
Objection: Here it is asserted that if this be the case, then ignorance is a ality of the knower?
Reply: No, for the defects such as blindness are seen to belong to the eye which is an organ. As for your notion that 'ignorance is a ality of the experiencer, and the very fact of being possessed of the ality of ignorance is what constitutes the mundane state of the Knower of the field; the assertion which was made (by the Vedantin) in that connection, "that the Knower of th field is God Himself and not a mundane being, " is improper,'-this is not so. As for example: Since such defects as false perception etc. are seen to belong to the organ eye, therefore false perception etc. or their causes, viz defects like blindness etc., do not belong to the perceiver. Just as blindness of the eyes does not pertain to the perceiver since on being curved through treatment it is not seen in the perceiver, similarly notions like non-perception, false perception, doubt, and their causes should, in all cases, pertain to some organ; not to the perceiver, the Knower of the field. And since they are objects of perception, they are not alities of the Knower in the same way that light is of a lamp. Just because they are objects of perception, they are cognized as different from one's own Self.
Besides, it is denied by all schools of thought that in Liberation, when all the organs depart, there is any association with such defects as ignorance etc. If they (the defects) be the alities of the Self Itself, the Knower of the field, as heat is of fire, then there can never be a dissociation from them. Again, since there can be no association with or dissociation from anything for the immutable, formless Self which is all-pervading like space, therefore it is established that the Knower of the field is ever identical with God. This follows alos from the utternance of the Lord, 'Being without beginning and without alities' (31), etc.
Objection: Well, if this be so, then, owing to the nonexistence of the world and the mundane creatures, there will arise the defect of the uselessness of the scriptures, etc.
Reply: No, since this (defect) is admitted by all. A defect that is admitted by all who believe in the Self is not to be explained by one alone!
Objection: How has this been admitted by all?
Reply: People of all schools of thought who believe in the Self admit that there is no worldly behaviour or the behaviour of a worldling in the liberated ones. Yet, in their case (i.e. in those various schools), it is not admitted that there is any possibility of such a defect as the scriptures becoming useless, etc. Similarly, in our case let the scriptures be useless when the knowers of the field become identified with God; and purposeful within the sphere of ignorance. This is just as in the case of all the dualists, where it is admitted that the scriptures etc. become useful in the state of bondage, not in the state of Liberation.
Objection: Well, for us all dualists, bondage and Liberation of the Self are real in the truest sense. So, when things to be renounced or accepted as also the means thereto are real, the scriptures etc. become meaningful. On the other hand, may it not be that for the non-dualists, since duality deos not exist in truest sense, it being the creation of ignorance, therefore the state of bondage of the Self is not ultimately real, and hence the scriptures etc. become purposeless as they remain shorn of a subject-matter?
Reply: No, since it is not logical that the Self should have different states. If this were possible at all, then the states of bondage and freedom of the Self should be simultaneous, or successive. As to that, they cannot occur simultaneously, since they are contradictory-like rest and motion in the same object. Should they occur successively and without being caused, then there will arise the contingency of there being no Liberation; if they occur through some cause, then, since they do not exist inherently, there arises the contingency of their being ultimately unreal. In this case also the assumption becomes falsified.
Moreover, when ascertaining the precedence and succession of the states of bondage and Liberation, the state of bondage will have to be considered as being the earlier and having no beginning, but an end. And that is contrary to valid means of knowledge. Similarly it will have to be admitted that the state of Liberation has a beginning, but no end- which is certainly opposed to valid means of knowledge. And it is not possible to established eternality for something that has states nd undergoes a change from one state to another. On the other hand, if for avoiding the defect of non-eternality the different states of bondage and Liberation be not assumed, then, even for the dualists such defects as the purposelessness of the scriptures become certainly unavoidable. Thus, the situation being similar (for both), it is not for the Advaitin (alone) to refute the objection.
Nor do the scriptures become purposeless, because the scriptures are applicable to the commonly known unenlightened person. It is indeed in the case of the ignorant person-not in the case of the enlightened one-that there occurs the perception of identity of the Self with the effect (i.e. enjoyership) and the cause (i.e. agentship) which are not-Self. For, in the case of the enlightened persons, it is impossible that, after the dawn of the realization of non-identity of the Self with effect and cause, they can have Self identification with these as 'I'. Surely, not even a downright fool, or a lunatic and such others, see water and fire or shade and light as identical; what to speak of a discriminating person!
Therefore, such being the case, the scriptures dealing with injunction and prohibition do not concern a person who sees the distinction of the Self from effect and cause. For, when Devadatta is ordered to do som work with the words, 'You do this,' Visnumitra who happens to be there does not, even on hearing the ?nd, conclude, 'I have been ordered.' But this conclusion is reasonable when the person for whom the order is meant is not understood. So also with regard to cause and effect.
Objection: Can it not be that, even after having realized the Self as different from effect and cuase, it is ite reasonable from the standpoint of natural relationship, [Natural relationship-Self-identification with the body through ignorance.] that with regard to the scriptures one should have the understanding, 'I am enjoined to adotp the means that yields a desired result, and am porhibited from adopting the means that leads to an undesirable result'? As for instance, in the case of a father and son, or between others, even though there exists the awareness of the distinction between each other, still there is the comprehension of the implication of the injunctions and prohibitions meant for one as being also meant for the other. [In the (Br. (1.5.17) we read, 'Now therefore the entrusting: When a man thinks he will die, he says to his son, "You are Brahman, you are the sacrifice, and you are the world,"' etc. It has been enjoined here in this manner that the son should accept as his own all the duties thus entrusted to him by the father. Similarly, it is understood that when a son in unable to perform his own duties, the father has to accept them. So also in the case of brothers and others.
Thus, in the case of the enlightened person also, though there is a comprehension of his own distinction from effect and cause, still, owing to his earlier relationship with ignorance, body, etc., there is no contradiction in his understanding that the injunctions and prohibitions are meant for him.]
Reply: No, since identification of the Self with effect and cause is possible only before attaining the knowledge of the Self as distinct (from them). It is only after one has followed (or eschewed) what is enjoined or prohibited by the scriptures that he comprehends his own distinction from the effect and cause; not before. [In B.S. (3.4.26-7) it is said that the merit earned by the performance of scriptural duties helps to generate knowledge of Brahman. Therefore these duties are not meant for the enlightened. (By following what is enjoined, and avoiding what is prohibited, one's mind becomes purified, and then only one understands he is different from cause and effect-agentship and enjoyership.-Tr.)] Therefore it is established that the scriptures dealing with injunctions and prohibitions are meant for the ignorant. 
Objection: Well, if (injunctions and prohibitions) such as, 'One who desires heaven shall perform sacrifices', 'One should not eat poisoned meat,' etc. be not observed by those who have realized the Self as distinct and by those who view only the body as the Self, then, from the absence of any observer of those (injunctions etc.) there would follow the uselessness of the scriptures.
Reply: No, because engagement in or abstention from actions follows from what is ordained by the scriptures. As for one who has realized the identity of the Lord and the knower of the field, one who has realized Brahman-he does not engage in action. Similarly, even the person who does not believe in the Self does not engage in action, under the idea that the other world does not exist. However, one who has inferred the existence of the Self on the ground of the wellknown fact that study of the scriptures dealing with injunctions and prohibitions becomes otherwise purposeless, who has no knowledge of the essential nature of the Self, and in whom has arisen hankering for the results of actions-he faithfully engages in action. This is a matter of direct perception to all to us. Hence, the scriptures are not purposeless.
Objection: May it not be that the scriptures will become meaningless when, by noticing abstention from action in the case of men with discrimination, their followers too will abstain?
Reply: No, because discrimination arises in some rare person only. For, as at present, some rare one among many people comes to possess discrimination. Besides, fools do not follow one who has discrimination, because (their) engagement in action is impelled by defects such as attachment etc. And they are seen to get engaged in such acts as black magic. Moreover, engagement in action is natural. Verily has it been said (by the Lord), 'But it is Nature that acts' (5.14).
Therefore, the mundane state consists of nothing but ignorance, and is an object of perception (to the ignorant man who sees it) just as it appears to him. Ignorance and its effects do not belong to the Knower of the feild, the Absolute. Moreover, false knowledge cannot taint the supreme Reality. For, water in a mirage cannot taint the supreme Reality. For, water in a mirage cannot make a desert muddy with its moisture. Similarly, ignorance cannot act in any way on the Knower of the field. Hence has this been said, 'And understand Me to be knower of the field,' as also, 'Knowledge remains covered by ignorance' (5.15).
Objection: Then, what is this that even the learned say like the worldly people, 'Thus [Possessed of aristorcracy etc.] am I,' 'This [Body, wife, etc.] verily belongs to Me'?
Reply: Listen. This is that learnedness which consists in seeing the field as the Self! On the contrary, should they realize the unchanging Knower of the field, then they will not crave for enjoyment or action with the idea, 'May this be mine.' Enjoyment and action are mere perversions. This being so, the ignorant man engages in action owing to his desire for results. On the other hand, in the case of an enlightened person who has realized the changeless Self, engagement in aciton in impossible because of the absence of desire for results. Hence, when the activities of the aggregate of body and organs cease, his withdrawal from action is spoken of in a figurative sense. 
Some may have this other kind of learnedness: 'The Knower of the field is God Himself; and the field is something different and an object of knowledge to the Knower of the field. But I am a mundane being, happy and sorrowful. And it is my duty to bring about the cessation of worldly existence through the knowledge of the field and the Knower of the field, and by continuing to dwell in His true nature after directly perceiving through meditation God, the Knower of the field,' and he who, understands thus, and he who teaches that 'he (the taught) is not the Knower of the field,' and he who, being under such an idea, thinks, 'I shall render meaningful the scriptures dealing with the worldly state and Liberation'-is the meanest among the learned. That Self-immolator, being devoid of any link with the traditional interpreters of the purport of the scriptures, misinterprets what is enjoined in the scriptures and imagines what is not spoken there, and thery himself becoming deluded, befools others too. Hence, one who is not a knower of the traditional interpretation is to be ignored like a fool, though he may be versed in all the scriptures.
As for the objection that, if God be one with the knower of the field, He will then become a mundane being, and that, if the knowers of the fields are one with God, then from the nonexistence of mundane beings will follow the absence of the mundane state, -these two objections have been refuted by admitting Knowledge and ignorance as having different characteristics.
Objection: How?
Reply: By saying that any defect imagined through ignorance does not affect the supreme Reality which is the substratum of that (imagination). In accordance with this an illustration was cited that a desert is not made muddy by water in a mirage. Even the defect of the possibility of nonexistence of the mundange state, conseent on the nonexistence of individual souls, stands refuted by the explanation that the mundane state and the individual souls are imagined through ignorance.
Objection: The defect of mundane existence in the knower of the field consists in his being possessed of ignorance. And sorrowfulness etc. which are its products are matters of direct experience.
Reply: No, since whatever is known is an attribute of the field, therefore the knower-the knower of the field-cannot reasonably be tainted by the defects arising from it. Whatsoever blemish-not existing in the knower of the field-you attribute to It is logically an object of experience, and hence it is verily a ality of the field; not the ality of the knower of the field. Nor does the knower of the field become tainted thery, because of knower cannot possibly have any conjunction with an object of knowledge. Should there be a conjunction, then there will be no possibility at all of its (the latter's) becoming a knowable. Oh! Sir, if being ignorant, sorrowful, etc. be alities of the Self, how is it that they are directly perceived? Or how can they be alities of the Knower of the field? If the conclusion be that all that is known consititutes the field, and that the one who knows is verily the knower of the field, then, to say that being ignorant, sorrowful, etc.are the alities of the knower of the field and that they are directly perceived is a contradictory statement having only ignorance as its basis.
Here, (the opponent) asks: To whom does ignorance belong?
(The answer is that) it belongs verily to him by whom it is experienced!
Objection: In whom is it perceived?
Reply: Here the answer is: It is pointless to ask, 'In whom is ignorance experienced?'
Objection: How?
Reply: If ignorance be perceived (by you), then you perceive its possessor as well. Moreover, when that possessor of ignorance is perceived it is not reasonable to ask, 'In whom is it perceived?' For, when an owner of cattle is seen, the estion, 'To whom do the cattle belong', does not become meaningful.
Objection: Well, is not the illustration dissimilar? Since, the cattle and their owner are directly perceived, their relation also is directly perceived. Hence the estion is meaningless. Ignorance and its possessor are not directly perceived in that manner, in which case the estion would have been meaningless.
Reply: What will it matter to you if you know the relation of ignorance with a person who is not directly perceived as possessed of ignorance?
Opponent: Since ignorance is a source of evil, therefore it should be got rid of.
Reply: He to whom ignorance belongs will get rid of it!
Opponent: Indeed, ignorance belongs to myself.
Reply: In that case, you know ignorance as also yourself who possess it?
	
Opponent: I know, but not through direct perception.
Reply: If you know through inference, then how is the connection (between yourself and ignorance) known? Surely it is not possible for you the knower to have at that time ['When you are knowing your own ignorance.'] the knowledge of the relation (of the Self) with ignorance which is an object of knowledge; ['After having perceived ignorance as an object of your knowledge, how can you who continue to be the knower cognize yourself as the knower of that ignorance? For this would lead to the contradiction of the same person becoming the subject and the object of cognition.'] because the cognizer is then engaged in cognizing ignorance as an object. Besides, there cannot be someone who is a (separate) cognizer of the relation between the knower and ignorance, and a separate cognition of that (relation), for this would lead to infinite regress. If the knower and the relation between the knower and the thing known be cognizable, then a separate cognizer has to be imagined. Of him, again, another knower has to be imagined; of him again a separate cognizer would have to be imagined! Thus, an infinite regress be comes unavoidable.
Again, whether the knowable be ignorance or anything else, a knowable is verily a knowable; similarly, even a knower is surely a knower; he does not become a knowable. And when this is so, [Since the knower cannot be known, therefore his relation with ignorance also cannot be known by himself or by anybody else] nothing of the cognizer-the knower of the field-is tainted by such defects as ignorance, sorrowfulness, etc.
Objection: May it not be said that the (Self's) defect is surely this, that the field, which is full of defects, is cognized (by It)?
Reply: No, because it is the Immutable, which is consciousness, by nature, that is figuratively spoken of as the cognizer. It is just like figuratively attributing the act of heating to fire merely because of its (natural) heat. Just as it has been shown here by the Lord Himself that identification with action, cause and effect are absent in the Self, and that action, cause, etc. are figuratively attributed to the Self owing to their having been superimposed (on It) through ignorance, so has it been shown by Him in various places: 'He who thinks of this One as the killer৷৷.' (2.19), 'While actions are being done in ever way by the gunas of Nature' (3.27), 'The Omnipresent neither accepts anybody's sin৷৷.' (5.15), etc. It has been explained by us, too, in that very way, and in the following contexts also we shall explain accordingly.
Objection: Well, in that case, if identification with action, cause and effect be naturally absent in the Self, and it they be superimpositions through ignorance, then it amounts to this that actions are meant for being undertaken only by the ignorant, not by the enlightened. 
 
Reply: It is true that is comes to this. This very fact we shall explain under the verse, 'Since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body৷৷.' (18.11). And, in the context dealing with the conclusion of the purport of the whole Scripture, we shall explain this elaborately under the verse, '৷৷.in brief indeed, O son of Kunti,৷৷.which is the supreme consummation of Knowledge' (ibid. 50) It is needless here to expatiate further, Hence we conclude.
The next verse, '(Hear about)৷৷.what that field is,' etc., summarizing the purport of the chapter dealing with the 'field' taught in the verses begining from 'This body৷৷.'etc., is being presented. For it is proper to introduce briefly the subject-matter that is sought to be explained.
13.30 He sees, who sees that all actions are performed by Nature alone and that the Self is actionless.
13.30 He who understands that it is only the Law of Nature that brings action to fruition, and that the Self never acts, alone knows the Truth.
13.30. Whosoever views all actions as being performed (or all objects as being created), indeed by the Material Cause itself and at the same time views his own Self as non-performer (or non-creator) - he veiws properly.
13.30 He who sees that all acts are done universally by Prakrti alone and likewise that the self is not the doer, he sees indeed.
13.30 And he who sees actions as being done in various ways by Nature itself, and also the Self as the non-agent,-he sees.
13.30 When he perceives that 'all acts are performed by the Prakrti' in the manner previously stated in, 'Prakrti is said to be the cause of agency to the body and sense-organs' (13.20), and perceive also that 'the self, being of the form of knowledge, is not the doer,' and that the self's conjunction with the Prakrti, Its direction of the body and Its experiences of happiness and misery are the result of ignorance of the nature of Karma - then indeed he perceives the pure self.
13.30 Prakrtya etc.  He whose firm conviction is of this nature 'The Material Cause alone performs  (or creates) this; I do nothing' - he, though he performs  (or creates) all, does not  perform  (or create) anything  [in fact]. In this manner, is the absence of doership in him.
13.30 And yah, he who; pasyati, sees, realizes; karmani, actions, those performed through speech, mind and body; as kriyamanani, being done, being accomplished; sarvasah, in various ways; prakrtya, by Nature-Nature is God's Maya consisting of the three alities, as is said in the Upanisadic text, 'However, know Maya as Nature' (Sv. 4.10); by that Nature; eva, itself-not by the other [Not by the Pradhana of the Sankhyas, known otherwise as prakrti.] which transforms itself in the form of cause and effects such as Mahat etc.; tatha, and also; atmanam, the Self, the Knower of the field; as akartaram, the non-agent, devoid of all adjuncts; sah, he; pasyati, sees-he is the one who has realized the supreme Reality. This is the idea. What is implied is that there is no valid proof about differences in the Non-agent who is devoid of alities and is unconditioned like space.
The Lord elaborates again in other words that very true knowledge:
13.31 When a man sees the whole variety of beings as resting in the One, and spreading forth from That alone, he then becomes Brahman.
13.31 He who sees the diverse forms of life all rooted in One, and growing forth from Him, he shall indeed find the Absolute.
13.31. When he perceives the  [mutual] difference of beings as abiding in One, and its expansion from That alone, at that time he becomes the Brahman.
13.31 When he perceives the independent modes of existence of all beings centred in one, and as also their expansion from It alone, then he attains to brahman.
13.31 When one realizes that the state of diversity of living things is rooted in the One, and that their manifestation is also from That, then one becomes identified with Brahman.
13.31 When he perceives that the diversified 'modes of existence' of all beings as men, divinities etc., are founded on the two principles of Prakrti and Purusa; when he perceives that their existence as divine, human, short, tall etc., is rooted in 'one' common foundation, namely, in the Prakrti, and not in the self; when he sees that 'their expansion', i.e., the successive proliferaton into sons, grandsons and such varieties of beings, is from Prakrti alone - then he reaches the brahman. The meaning is that he attains the self devoid of limitations, in Its pure form of knowledge.
13.31 See Comment under 13.34
13.31 Yada, when, at the time when; anupasyati, one realizes-having reflected in accordance with the instructions of the scriptures and the teachers, one realizes as a matter of one's own direct experience that 'All this is but the Self' (Ch. 7.25.2); that bhuta-prthak-bhavam, the state of diversity of living things; is ekastham, rooted in the One, existing in the one Self; and their vistaram, manifestation, origination; tatah, eva, is also from That-when he realizes that origination in such diverse ways as, 'the vital force is from the Self, hope is from the Self, memory [Smara, memory; see Sankaracarya's Comm. on Ch. 7.13.1.-Tr.] is from the Self, space is from the Self, fire is from the Self, water is from the Self, coming into being and withdrawal are owing to the Self, food is from the Self' (op. cit. 7.26.1); tada, then, at that time; brahma sampadyate, one becomes identified with Brahman Itself. This is the import.
If the same Self be the Self in all the bodies, then there arises the possiblity of Its association with their defects. Hence this is said:
13.32 Being without beginning and being devoid of (any) alities, the Supreme Self, imperishable, though dwelling in the body, O Arjuna, neither acts nor is tainted.
13.32 The Supreme Spirit, O Prince, is without beginning, without Qualities and Imperishable, and though it be within the body, yet It does not act, nor is It affected by action.
13.32. Because This is beginningless, and because This has no alities, this Supreme Self is changeless and It neither acts, nor gets stained [by actions],  even-though It dwells in the body, O son of Kunti !
13.32 This supreme self, though dwelling in the body, is immutable, O Arjuna, being without beginning. It neither acts nor is tainted, as It is without Gunas.
13.32 Being without beginning and without alities, O son of Kunti, this immutable, supreme Self does not act. nor is It affected [Also translated as tainted.-Tr.], although existing in the body.
13.32 This 'supreme self' (Atman) has been defined as having a nature different from that of the body. While existing in the body, It is 'immutable', i.e., It is not liable to decay as It is 'without a beginning,' i.e., never created at any point of time. Because It is 'free from Gunas,' being devoid of Sattva and other Gunas of Prakrti, It neither acts nor gets tainted; It is not tainted by the alities of the body.

Granted that the self being without Gunas, does not act; but how is it possible that the Atman is not tainted by Its constant association with the alities of the body?  To this, Sri Krsna replies:
13.32 See Comment under 13.34
13.32 Anadivat, being without beginning: Adih means cause; that which has no cause is anadih. That which has a cause undergoes loss of its own characteristics. But this One, being causeless, has no parts. This being so, It does not suffer loss.
So also, nirgunatvat, being without alities: indeed, It si only something possessing alities that perishes owing to the losss of its alities. But this One, being without alities, does not perish. Hence, ayam, this; paramatma, supreme Self; is avyayah, immutable. It suffers no depletion. Therefore It is immutable. Since this is so, therefore, api, although; sarira-sthah, existing in the body-since the perception of the Self occurs in the bodies, It is said to be 'existing in the body'; even then, It na, does not; karoti, act. From the very fact that It does not act, It na, is not; lipyate, affected by the result of any action. For, one who is an agent of action becomes affected by its result. But this One is not an agent. Hence It is not affected by any result. This is the meaning.
Objection: Who is it, again, that acts in the body and becomes affected? On the one hand, if there be some embodied being other than the supreme Self who acts and becomes affected, then it has been improper to say in, 'And also understand Me to be the Knower of the field,' etc., that the Knower of the field and God are one. Again, if there be no embodied being who is different from God, then it has to be stated who is it that acts and gets affected. Or it has to be asserted that the supreme One does not exist. [If the supreme One also acts like us, then He is no God.]
Thus, since the Upanisadic philosophy as stated by the Lord is in every way difficult to understand and difficult to explain, it has therefore been abandoned by the Vaisesikas, the Sankhyas, the Jainas and the Buddhists.
Reply: As to that, the following refutation has been stated by the Lord Himself in, 'But it is Nature that acts' (5.14). Indeed, Nature, which is nothing but ignorance, acts and becomes affected. In this way empirical dealing becomes possible; but in reality it does not occur in the one supreme Self.
It has been accordingly shown by the Lord in various places that there is no duty to be performed by those who adhere to this philosophy of discriminating knowledge of the supreme Reality, who are steadfast in Knowledge, who have spurned actions arising out of ignorance, and who are mendicants belonging to the highest Order of monks.
The Lord cites an illustration to show like what It does not act and is not affected:
13.33 As the all-pervading ether is not tainted, because of its subtlety, so the Self seated everywhere in the body is not tainted.
13.33 As space, though present everywhere, remains by reason of its subtlety unaffected, so the Self, though present in all forms, retains its purity unalloyed.
13.33. Just as the all-pervading Ether is not stained because of its subtleness, in the same fashion the Self, abiding in the body everywhere, is not stained.
13.33 As the all-pervading etther is not tainted because of its subtlety, even so, the self abiding in the body everywhere, is not tainted.
13.33 As the all-pervading space is not defiled, because of its subtlety, similarly the Self, present everywhere in the body [The singular number is used to denote a class, i.e. all bodies. See S.-Tr.], is not defiled.
13.33 As the 'all-pervading ether,' though in contact with all substances, is 'not tainted' by the alities of all these substances, as it is 'subtle' - even so the self, though 'present in all the bodies,' everywhere, namely, in divinities, men etc., is not contaminated by these bodies by reason of Its extreme subtleness.
13.33 See Comment under 13.34
13.33 Yatha, as; sarva-gatam, the all-pervading; akasam, space;-though pervasive, still, na upalipyate, is not defiled, does not come into contact; saukmyat, because of its subtlety; tatha, similarly; atma, the Self; avasthitah, present, sarvatra, everywhere; dehe, in the body; na, is not; upalipyate, defiled.
Further,
13.34 Just as the one sun illumines the whole world, so also the Lord of the field (Supreme Self) 
illumines the whole field, O Arjuna.
13.34 As the one Sun illuminates the whole earth, so the Lord illumines the whole universe.
13.34. Just as a single sun illumines this entire world, so also the Lord-of-the-Field illumines the entire Field, O descendant of  Bharata !
13.34 As the one sun illumines this whole world, so does the Knower of the Field (Ksetrin, the self), O Arjuna, illumine the whole Field (the body).
13.34 As the single sun illumines this whole world, similarly, O descendant of the Bharata dynasty, the Knower of the field illumines the whole field.
13.34 As the 'one sun' illumines 'all this world' by his radiance, so the 'knower of the body' illumines the entire Ksetra, i.e., the body, by Its own knowledge, within and without and from head to toe, by conceiving 'This my body is of this nature.' This self of the said nature is totally different from the body, because It is the knower of the body. The body is the object of Its knowledge and is therefore different from It, even as the illuminating sun is totally different from the illumined world.
13.31-34 Yada etc.  upto na upalipyate.  When  [a man of  Yoga] perceives the mutual difference i.e.,  separateness of all beings  (all mutually different beings) in the very Self  on account of Its all pervasive nature and realises the said difference as having sprung up from the Self alone - even then he does not get any stain.  For [in that case]  he would be the creator  (or performer) of all.  For, he is none but the  Supreme Self; and though residing in the body, he is not stained just as the Eather is  [not stained].
13.34 Yatha, as; ekam, the one; ravih, sun; prakasayati, illumines; imam, this; krtsnam, whole; lokam, world tatha, similarly;-who?-ksetri, the Knower of the field, i.e. the supreme Self, though one; prakasayati, illumines; krtsnam, the whole; ksetram, field, from the 'great elements' to 'fortitude' (cf. 5-6).
Here the illustration of the sun serves to highlight two aspects of the Self, viz that, like the sun, the Self is one in all the fields, and that It remains unaffected.
This verse is meant for summarizing the idea of the whole of this chapter:
13.35 They who, by the eye of knowledge, perceive the distinction between the field and its knower and also the liberation from the Nature of being, go to the Supreme.
13.35 Those who with the eyes of wisdom thus see the difference between Matter and Spirit, and know how to liberate Life from the Law of Nature, they attain the Supreme."
13.35. Those who thus understand, with the knowledge-eye, the inner Soul of the Field and the Field-sensitizer and also the deliverance from the Material Cause of the elements-they attain the Supreme.
13.35 Those who thus discern with the eye of knowledge the difference between the body or the Field (Ksetra) and the knower of the body or Field-knower (Ksetrajna), and the means of deliverance from the manifested Prakrti - they attain the Supreme.
13.35 Those who know thus through the eye of wisdom the distinction between the field and the Knower of the field, and the annihilation of the Matrix of beings,-they reach the Supreme.
13.35 Those who 'discern thus' in the described manner the 'difference', namely, the difference between the body and the knower of the body with 'the eye of knowledge' or discrimination, and also the 'means of deliverance from manifested Prakrti' - they attain the 'highest', namely, the self. They are completely delivered from bondage. Moksa is that by which deliverance is effected. The means of deliverance as already stated consists of alities beginning with modesty (13.7). They, through the knowledge already imparted concerning the differences between the body and the self, know those differences existing between them. Then learning about modesty etc., which form the means of deliverance from Prakrti that has devleoped into material elements constituting the body, they have to practise these virtues, and they will thery be absolutely delivered from bondage and will reach the self marked by infinite knowledge abiding in Its own form.
13.35 Yatha etc.  But, how is it that a single Supreme Self pervades many a Field ?  This doubt has even been removed by the well known example, the sun.  The entire Field :  It means  [all] the movable and immovable Fields.
13.35 Ye, those who; viduh, know; evam, thus, in the manner described above; jnana-caksusa, through the eye of wisdom-the eye is the realization in the form of the knowledge of the Self, which arises from following the instructions of the scriptures and teachers; through that eye of wisdom; antaram, the distinction, the particular mutual distinction; ksetra-ksetrajnayoh, beween the field and the Knower of the field as they have been explained; and bhuta-prakrti-moksam, the annihilation of the Matrix of beings-the Matrix of beings is that which is described as ignorance and is called the Unmanifest; (those who know) the annihilation (moksanam) of that Matrix of beings; te, they; yanti, reach, go to; param, the Supreme, to Brahman, the Reality which is the suprme Goal. The idea is that they do not take up a body again.
13.4 What the field is and of what nature, what are its modifications and whence it is and also who He is and what His powers are  hear all that from Me in brief.
13.4 What is called Matter, of what it is composed, whence it came, and why it changes, what the Self is, and what Its power - this I will now briefly set forth.
13.4. What that Field is and of what nature it is; why it modifies, whence and what; and who he (the Field-sensitizer) is;  and of what nature He is; listen to [all] that from Me collectively.
13.4 Listen briefly from Me what the Field is, and what it is like, what is modifications are, what purpose it serves, what it is; and who the self is and what Its powers are.
13.4 Hear from Me in brief about (all) that as to what that field is and how it is; what its changes are, and from what cause arises what effect; and who He is, and what His powers are.
13.4 What the 'Field is' namely, what its substance is; what it is 'like', namely, what things depend on it; what its 'modifications' are, namely, what its transformations are; what the 'purpose' is for which it has been originated; 'what it is,' namely, what its true nature is; 'who it is,' namely, who the individual self is and what Its nature is like; what Its 'powers', are, namely, what powers It possesses. All this, briefly learn from Me.
13.4 See Comment under 13.5
13.4 Srnu, hear, i.e., having heard, understand; me, from Me, from My utterance; samasena, in brief; about (all) tat, that-the true nature of the field and the Knower of the field, as they have been described; as to yat, what; tat, that-tat stands for that which has been indicated as 'This body' (in verse 1); ksetram, field is, which has been referred to as 'this'; ca, and; yadrk, how it is along with its own alities; yadvikari, what its changes are; ca, and; yatah, from what cause; arises yat, what effect (-arises is understood-); sah ca yah, and who He, the Knower of the field indicated above, is; ca, and; yat-prabhavah, what His powers are. Yat-probhavah is He who is possessed of the powers arising from the adjuncts. The word ca has been used (throughout) in the sense of and.
For making the intellect of the hearer interested the Lord praises that true nature of the field and the Knower of the field which is intended to be taught:
13.5 Sages have sung in many ways, in various distinctive chants and also in the suggestive words indicative of the Absolute, full of reasoning and decisive.
13.5 Seers have sung of It in various ways, in many hymns and sacred Vedic songs, weighty in thought and convincing in argument.
13.5. This has been sung many times by sages, and also has been clearly decided in the various Vedas in different contexts by means of  [their]  words that are suggestive of the Brahman (i.e. in the Upanisads) and are full of reasoning.
13.5 It has been sung by seers in various ways, in various distinctive hymns, and also in the well-reasoned and conclusive words of the Brahma-sutras.
13.5 It has been sung of in various ways by the Rsis, separately by the different kinds [The different branches of Vedic texts.] of Vedic texts, and also by the rational and convicing sentences themselves which are indicatvie of and lead of Brahman.
13.5 It is this truth regarding the Kestra and Ksetrajna that has been sung in various ways by Parasara and others seers. For example, 'I and you and others are composed of the elements; and the elements, following the stream of alities, assume a shape; these alities, Sattva and the rest, are dependent on Karma; and Karma, accumulated by nescience, influences the condition of all beings. The self is pure, imperishable, tranil, void of alities and is pre-eminent over Prakrti' (V. P., 2.13.69-71). Similarly:  'The body, characterised by head, hands, feet and the like is different from Purusa.' Which of these can I designate by the name I?'  (Ibid., 2.13.89). And also:  'Are you the head or the belly?  Are you indeed the feet and other limbs, or do they belong to you, O King?  You are distinct in your nature from all your members, O King. Know, O King, and understand "Who am I" '. (Ibid., 1.13.102-3).

Moreover they state that Vasudeva constitutes the Self of the distinct entities (Ksetra and Ksetrajna):  'The senses, Manas, Buddhi, vigour, splendour, strength, courage, both Ksetra and Ksetrajna have Vasudeva for their self. (Ma. Bha. Sa., 149.136).

In various distinctive hymns, namely, in the Vedas, Rg, Yajus, Saman and Atharvan, the distinction of body and the self has been sung. The nature of the body is described in the following text:  'From this Self, verily, ether arose; from the ether, air; from air, fire; from fire, water; from water, the earth; from the earth, herbs; from the herbs, food; from food, the person. The same person, verily, consists of the essence of food' (Tai. U., 2.1.2). Afterwards that which is inner than this (body) and which consists of Prana (or the vital breath), and that which is inner than this and which consists of mind are described. The nature of Ksetrjna is stated in the passage:  'Verily, other than, and within, that one that consists of mind, that (the individual Self) consists of understanding' (Ibid., 2.4.2). Later, the Supreme Brahman is stated in the text; 'Verily, other than, and within, that one consisting of understanding, is the Supreme Self that consists of bliss' (Ibid., 1.5.2). This is stated to be the Surpeme Self, consisting of bliss, as forming the inner Self of the individual self. Similarly in the three Vedas, Rg, Saman and Atharvan, here and there, the distinctive existence of the Ksetra and the Ksetrajna is affirmed with Brahman for their Self.

Likewise, the same purpose is taught in the words of the Brahma-sutras, namely, the aphorisms about Brahman, known also as the Sariraka-sutras, which are characterised by reasoning, decision and conclusion. In the Sutras commencing with, 'Not ether, on account of the absence of the Sruti' (B. S., 2.3.1), the nature and the mode of the Ksetra is determined. In the Sutras commencing with 'Not the self, on account of the Sruti and on account of the eternity, (which is made out) from them' (Ibid., 2.3.18), the true nature of the Ksetrajna is determined. In the Sutras 'But from the Supreme, this being declared by Sruti' (Ibid., 2.3.40), that Ksetrajna has the Lord for Its Self on account of Its being under the control of the Lord, is declared. It has been sung in various ways; the meaning of this Sloka is this:  Listen about the truths of the Ksetra and the Ksetrajna which have been expounded in numerous ways and declared by Me in a lucid and brief manner.
13.4-5 Tat Ksetram etc. Rsibhih etc.  Why it modifies : due to what this  [Field] suffers  modification.  Collectively : not at all separately  (one by one).  [The Bhagavat]  decides all the estions in a general way.  Of course, many a time in many a way this has been declared by the seers and by the scritpures. But, let Me (the Bhagavat)  explain this collectively (briefly).
13.5 Gitam, It has been sung of, spoken of; bahudha, in various ways; rsibhih, by the Rsis, by Vasistha and others; sung prthak, separately; vividhaih, by the different kinds of; chandobhih, Vedic texts-chandas mean the Rg-veda etc; by them; ca, and; besides, hetumadbhih, by the rational; and viniscitaih, by the convincing, i.e. by those which are productive of certain knowledge-not by those which are in an ambiguous form; brahma-sutra-padaih eva, sentences themselves which are indicative of and lead to Brahman. Brahma-sutras are the sentences indicative of Brahman. They are called padani since Brahman is reached, known, through them. By them indeed has been sung the true nature of the field and the Knower of the field (-this is understood). The Self is verily known through such sentences as, 'The Self alone is to be meditated upon' (Br. 1.4.7), which are indicative of and lead to Brahman.
To Arjuna who had become interested as a result of the eulogy, the Lord says:
13.6 The great elements, egoism, intellect, and also the Unmanifested Nature, the ten senses and one (mind), and the five objects of the senses.
13.6 The five great fundamentals (earth, fire, air, water and ether), personality, intellect, the mysterious life force, the ten organs of perception and action, the mind and the five domains of sensation;
13.6. The  [five]  great elements, the Egotism.  The Intellect, the Unmanifest, and also the ten organs and the one (organ and the) five objects of the sense-organs;
13.6 The great elements, the Ahankara, the Buddhi, the Avyakta, the ten senses and the one, besides, the five objects of the senses;
13.6 The great elements, egoism, intellect and the Unmanifest itself; the ten organs and the one, and the five objects of the senses;
13.6 - 13.7 The 'great elements, the Ahankara, the Buddhi and the Avyakta' are substances that originate the Ksetra. The 'great elements' are the earth, water, fire, air and ether. The 'Ahankara' here means Bhutadi (primeval element). The 'Buddhi' is called Mahat; the 'Avyakta' is known as the Prakrti. The 'ten senses and the one' and the five objects of senses are principles depending on the Ksetra. The 'five sensorial organs' are ear, skin, eye, tongue and nose. The five motor organs are speech, hands, feet, and the organs of excretion and reproduction. These are the ten senses. The Manas is the additional 'one' moe. The 'objects of the senses' are five - sound, touch, form, taste and smell.

Desire, hatred, pleasure and pain, being the transformation of the Ksetra, are said to be the modifications of the Ksetra. Though desire, hatred, pleasure and pain are the alities of the self, yet they originate from the association of the self with the Ksetra. Sri Krsna will state that they are the attributes of the self; 'In the experience of pleasure and pain, the self is said to be the cause' (13.20).

The combination of elements serves as the support (Adhrti) of the intelligent self. As such, the word Adhrti means substratum. The combination of material elements has arisen as the substratum for the self to experience pleasure and pain, and for aciring worldly experiences and the final release. The combination of elements is formed by substances commencing from the Prakrti and ending with the earth; it is the basis of senses which are endowed with the modifications of the nature of desire, hatred, pleasure and pain. These form a Sanghata or an association of elements. It serves as the basis of the experience of pleasure and pain by the individual self. This is what is said of the Ksetra. This Ksetra has been explained briefly with its modifications and effects.

Now certain alities, the effects of the Ksetra, worthy of being acired as being the means for securing the knowledge of the self, are enumerated.
13.6 See Comment under 13.7
13.6 Mahabhutani, the great elements: Those elements which are great owing to their pervasion of all midifications, and which are subtle. As for the gross elements, they will be spoken of by the word indriya-gocarah, objects of the senses.
Ahankarah, egoism, which is the source of the great elements and consists of the idea of 'I'. Buddhih, intellect, the source of egoism and consisting of the faculty of judgement; ca, and; its cause, the avyaktam eva, Unmanifest itself, the Undifferentiated, the power of God spoken of in, 'Maya of Mine৷৷.difficult to cross' (7.14). The word eva (itself) is used for singling out Prakrti (Nature). The Prakrti divided eightfold [The undifferentiated (avyakta), mahat, egoism and the five uncompunded subtle elements] is this much alone. The word ca (and) is used for joining the various categories.
The dasa, ten; indriyani, organs : The five, organs ear etc., which are called sense-organs since they produce perception, and the (other) five organs-organ of speech, hands, etc.-which are called motor-organs since they accomplish actions. They are ten. Ekam ca, and the one-which is that?-the mind, the eleventh, possessed of the power of thinking etc. (see fn. on p. 173). Ca, and; the panca, five; indriya-gacarah, objects of the senses-such objects as sound etc. The followers of the Sankhya call these which are such the twenty-four categories.
Thereafter, the Lord now says that even those alities which the Vaisesikas speak of as the attributes of the sould are certainly the attributes of the field, but not of the Knower of the field:
13.7 Desire, hatred, pleasure, pain, the aggregate (the body), intelligence, fortitude  the field has thus been briefly described with its modifications.
13.7 Desire, aversion, pleasure, pain, sympathy, vitality and the persistent clinging to life, these are in brief the constituents of changing Matter.
13.7. The desire, the hatred. the pleasure, the pain, the aggregate, the sensibility and the feeling of satisfaction (or self-?nd) :  This, together with modification, is what is collectively called  'the Field,  together with modification'.
13.7 Desire, hatred, pleasure and pain and the combination that constitutes the basis of consciousness (or the individual self). Thus this Ksetra has been briefly described with its modifications.
13.7 Desire, repulsion, happiness, sorrow, the aggregate (of body and organs), sentience, fortitude- this field, together with its modifications, has been spoken of briefly.
13.6- 13.7 The 'great elements, the Ahankara, the Buddhi and the Avyakta' are substances that originate the Ksetra. The 'great elements' are the earth, water, fire, air and ether. The 'Ahankara' here means Bhutadi (primeval element). The 'Buddhi' is called Mahat; the 'Avyakta' is known as the Prakrti. The 'ten senses and the one' and the five objects of senses are principles depending on the Ksetra. The 'five sensorial organs' are ear, skin, eye, tongue and nose. The five motor organs are speech, hands, feet, and the organs of excretion and reproduction. These are the ten senses. The Manas is the additional 'one' moe. The 'objects of the senses' are five - sound, touch, form, taste and smell.

Desire, hatred, pleasure and pain, being the transformation of the Ksetra, are said to be the modifications of the Ksetra. Though desire, hatred, pleasure and pain are the alities of the self, yet they originate from the association of the self with the Ksetra. Sri Krsna will state that they are the attributes of the self; 'In the experience of pleasure and pain, the self is said to be the cause' (13.20).

The combination of elements serves as the support (Adhrti) of the intelligent self. As such, the word Adhrti means substratum. The combination of material elements has arisen as the substratum for the self to experience pleasure and pain, and for aciring worldly experiences and the final release. The combination of elements is formed by substances commencing from the Prakrti and ending with the earth; it is the basis of senses which are endowed with the modifications of the nature of desire, hatred, pleasure and pain. These form a Sanghata or an association of elements. It serves as the basis of the experience of pleasure and pain by the individual self. This is what is said of the Ksetra. This Ksetra has been explained briefly with its modifications and effects.

Now certain alities, the effects of the Ksetra, worthy of being acired as being the means for securing the knowledge of the self, are enumerated.
13.6-7 Mahabhutani etc.  Iccha etc.  The Unmanifest :  the  [prime] material cause.  The organs :  together with the mind, they are  eleven in number.  The object of  the snese - organs : the colour etc.,  that are five in number.  Sensibility :  the perceiving energy i.e. the Individual Soul.  Feeling of satisfaction  (or self-?nd) :  It is well known that at the last moment, when a given action is  [just]  begun or accomplished and desire, anger etc.  (come up and accomplished)  there arises - in the case of everone from Brahma (personal god)  down to the worm-a feeling of satisfaction  (or self-?nd) as  'This much is ite sufficient for me;  what  is the use of another one ?  Let me always be in this manner',-a feeling which upholds one's  life, and is in the form of consolation and which is called by the expression  raga in the highly secret ?ndments.  (5-6)
 The Field has been explained as above; so also the Field-sensitizer.  Now  [what conduces to the true]  knowledge is mentioned as-
13.7 Iccha, desire: Having experienced again an object of that kind which had given him the feeling of pleasure earlier, a man wants to have it under the idea that it is a source of pleasure. That is this desire which is an attribute of the internal organ, and is the 'field' since it is an object of knowledge.
So also dvesah, repulsion: Having experienced again an object of that kind which he had earlier felt as a cause of sorrow, he hates it. That is this repulsion, and it is surely the 'field' since it is an object of knowledge. Similarly, sukham, happiness- which is favourable, tranil, having the ality of sattva-is the 'field' since it is an object of knowledge. Duhkham, sorrow-which is by nature adverse-, that, too, is the 'field' since it is a knowable.
Sanghatah is the aggregate, the combination, of body and organs. Cetana, sentience, is a state of the internal organ, manifest in that aggregate like fire in a heated lump of iron, and pervaded by an essence in the form of a semblance of Consciousness of the Self. That too is the 'field' because it is an object of knowledge. Dhrtih, fortitude, by which are sustained the body and organs when they get exhausted-that too is the 'field' becuase it is an object of knowledge. Desire etc. have been selected as suggestive of all the alities of the internal organ.
The Lord concludes what has been said: Etat, this; ksetram, field; savikaram, together with its modifications beginning from mahat (buddhi); has been samasena, briefly; udahrtam, spoken of. That 'field' which was referred to as, 'This body is called the field' (1), and is constituted by the aggregate of the constituents of the field has been explained in its different forms beginning from the great elements etc. ending with fortitude.
The Knower of the field whose alities are going to be described, and by realizing which Knower of the field along with His majesty Immortality follows-of Him, togehter with His attributes, the Lord Himself will narrate in the verse, 'I shall speak of that which is to be known' (12). But, for the present, the Lord enjoins the group of disciplines characterized as humility etc. which lead one to the knowledge of That (Knower of the field)-that group of humility etc. which are referred to by the word Knowledge since they lead to Knowledge, and owing to the existence of which one becomes appropriately competent for the realization of that Knowable, and being endued with which a monk is said to be steadfast in Knowledge:
13.8 Humility, unpretentiousness, non-injury, forgiveness, uprightness, service of the teacher, purity, steadfastness, self-control.
13.8 Humility, sincerity, harmlessness, forgiveness, rectitude, service of the Master, purity, steadfastness, self-control;
13.8. Absence of  pride; absence of hypocricy; harm-lessness; patience; uprightness; service to the preceptor; purity  [of mind and body]; steadfastness; self-control;
13.8 Modesty, absence of ostentation, non-injury, patience, sincerity, service of the preceptor, purity, firmness and self-restraint;
13.8 Humility, unpretentiousness, non-injury, for-bearance, sincerity, service of the teacher, cleanliness, steadiness, control of body and organs;
13.8 'Amanitva' means freedom from superiority complex towards eminent people. 'Adambhitva':  'Dambha' is the practice of Dharma for winning fame as a virtuous person; freedom from it is Adambhitva. 'Ahima' is absence of tendency to injure others by speech, mind and body. 'Ksanti' is the tendency of keeping the mind unmodified even when harmed by others. 'Arjava' means having a uniform disposition towards others in speech, mind and body. 'Acaryopasana' means being intent in prostrating, estioning, performing service etc., in regard to the teacher who imparts the knowledge of the self. 'Sauca' is the competence of the mind, speech and body, as enjoined by the Sastras, for the knowledge of the self and the means of this attainment. 'Sthairya' is possessing unshakable faith in the Sastras concerning the self. 'Atma-vinigraha' means the turning away from all objects that are different in nature from the self.
13.8 See Comment under 13.12
13.8 Amanitvam, humility-the ality of a vain person is manitvam, boasting about oneself; the absence of that is amanitvam. Adambhitvam, unpretentiousness- proclaming one's own virtues is dambhitvam; the absence of that is adambhitvam. Ahimsa, non-injury, absence of cruely towards creatures; ksantih, for-bearance, remaining undisturbed when offened by others; arjavam, sincerity, uprightness, absence of crookedness; acarya-upasanam, service of the teacher, attending on the teacher who instructs in the disciplines for Liberation, through acts of service etc.; saucam, cleanliness-washing away the dirt from the body with earth and water, and internally, removing the 'dirt' of the mind such as attachment etc. by thinking of their opposites; sthairyam, steadiness, perseverance in the path to Liberation alone; atma-vinigrahah, control of the aggregate of body and organs which is referred to by the word 'self', but which is inimical to the Self; restricting only to the right path that (aggregate) which naturally strays away in all directions.
Further,
13.9 Indifference to the objects of the senses and also absence of egoism; perception of (or reflection on) the evil in birth, death, old age, sickness and pain.
13.9 Renunciation of the delights of sense, absence of pride, right understanding of the painful problem of birth and death, of age and sickness;
13.9. Absence of desire for sense-objects; and also absence of egotism; pondering over the evils of birth, death, old age, sickness and sorrow;
13.9 Absence of desire with regard to sense-objects, and also absence of egotism, the perception of evil in birth, death, old age, disease and sorrow;
13.9 Non-attachment with regard to objects of the senses, and also absence of egotism; seeing the evil in birth, death, old age, diseases and miseries;
13.9 'Absence of desire' with regard to sense-objects means dispassion towards all objects different from the spiritual self by the constant awareness of the evil in them. 'Absence of egotism' means freedom from the misconception that the self is the body, which is in reality different from the self. This is only an illustration standing for other misconceptions too. It indicates freedom from the feeling of possession towards things which do not belong to one. 'Perception of evil in birth, death, old age, disease and sorrow' means the constant contemplation on the inevitable evil of birth, death, old age and sorrow while in the body.
13.9 See Comment under 13.12
13.9 Vairagyam, non-attachment, the attitude of dispassion; indriya-arthesu, with regard to objects of the senses, viz sound etc., with regard to seen or unseen objects of enjoyment; eva ca, and also; anahankarah, absence of egotism, absence of pride; janma-mrtyu-jara-vyadhi-duhkha-dosa-anudarsanam, seeing the evil in birth, death, old age, diseases and miseries-seeing the evil in each one of them from 'birth' to 'miseries'. The evil in birth consists in lying in the womb and coming out of it; seeing, i.e. thinking, of it. Similarly, thinking of the evil in death; so also, seeing in old age the evil in the form of deprivation of intelligence, strength and vigour, and becoming an object of contempt. In the same way, thinking of the evil in diseases like headtache etc.; so also with regard to miseries arising from causes physical, natural and supernatural.
Or, duhkha-dosa may mean the miseries themselves which are evil. Seeing, as before, that (evil in the form of miseries) in birth etc.-birth is miserable, death is miserable, old age is miserable, diseases are miserable. Birth etc. are miserable because they cause misery; not that they are miseries in themselves. [Birth etc. are perceivable events, and as such are not miseries in themselves.] Thus, when one thinks of the evil in the form of miseries in birth etc. dispassion arises with regard to the pleasures in the body, organs and objects. From that follows the tendency of the organs towards the indwelling Self for the realization of the Self. The seeing of the evil in the form of misery in birth etc. is called Knowledge because it thus becomes a cuase of the rise of Knowledge.
Moreover,
14.1 The Blessed Lord said  I will again declare (to thee) that supreme knowledge, the best of all knowledge, having known which all the sages have gone to the supreme perfection after this life.
14.1 "Lord Shri Krishna continued: Now I will reveal unto the Wisdom which is beyond knowledge, by attaining which the sages have reached Perfection.
14.1. The Bhagavat said  Further, once again I shall explain the supreme knowledge, the best among the knowledges, by knowing which all the seers have gone from here to the Supreme Success.
14.1 The Lord said  I shall declare again another kind of knowledge:  It is the best of all forms of knowledge, by knowing which all the sages have attained the state of perfection beyond this world.
14.1 The Blessed Lord said  I shall speak again of the supreme Knowledge, the best of all knowledges, by realizing which all the contemplatives reached the highest Perfection from here.
14.1 The Lord said  I shall declare again another kind of knowledge which is distinct from what was taught earlier concerning Gunas such as Sattva, falling within the sphere of Prakrti and Purusa. This knowledge going to be revealed is the best of all forms of knowledge concerning the Prakrti and the self. Having gained this knowledge, all sages, namely, those given to meditation, have attained perfection, beyond this world, the sphere of Samsara, having attained the essential and pure form of the self.

He further extols this knowledge, distinguishing it by its fruits:
14.1 Param etc. Knowledge has been described earlier;  the same I shall again explain  thoroughly,  i.e.,  in detail in order to examine individually the nature of the Strands. By knowing  which etc.: By this  [the Bhagavat] proclaims the tested trustworthiness and the popularity of this knowledge.
14.1 The word param should be connected with the remote word jnanam.
Pravaksyami, I shall speak; bhuyah, again-even though spoken of more than once in all the preceding chapters; of the param, supreme-it is supreme because it is concerned with the supreme Reality;-which is that?-jnanam, Knowledge; uttamam, the best-since it has the best result; jnananam, of all knowledges-. 'Of all knowledges' does not mean 'of humility' etc. (13.7-11). What then? It means 'among knowledges of all knowable things like sacrifice etc.' They do not lead to Liberation, but this (Knowledge) leads to Liberation. Hence the Lord praises it with the words 'supreme' and 'best', so as to arouse interest in the intellect of the listener.
Yat jnatva, by realizing which, by attaining which Knowledge; sarve, all; munayah, the contemplatives, the monks [But not those who espoused monasticsim as a formality in in the fourth stage of life.] gatah, reached, attained; itah, from here-when this bondage of the body had ceased; param, the highest; siddhim, Perfection, called Liberation. 
And the Lord shows the infallibility of this Perfection:
14.10 Now Sattva arises (prevails), O Arjuna, having overpowered Rajas and Tamas; nor Rajas, having overpowered Sattva and Tamas; and now Tamas, having overpowered Sattva and Rajas.
14.10 O Prince! Purity prevails when Passion and Ignorance are overcome; Passion, when Purity and Ignorance are overcome; and Ignorance when it overcomes Purity and Passion.
14.10. O descendant of Bharata !  The Sattva increases by overpowering the Rajas and the Tamas; the Rajas [increases by overpowering] the Sattva and the Tamas; and the Tamas does likewise [by overpowering] the Sattva and the Rajas.
14.10 Prevailing over Rajas and Tamas, Sattva preponderates, O Arjuna. Prevailing over Tamas and Sattva, Rajas preponderates. Prevailing over Rajas and Sattva, Tamas preponderates.
14.10 O scion of the Bharata dynasty, sattva increases by subduing rajas and tamas, rajas by overpowering sattva and tamas, and tamas by dominating over sattva and rajas.
14.10 Even though all the three Gunas of Sattva etc., are associated with the nature of the self conjoined with Prakrti in the form of body, yet owing to the dominance of previous Karmas and the differences in the food nourishing the body, Sattva etc., preponderate or are subdued by turn. Sometimes Sattva preponderates prevailing over Rajas and Tamas; sometimes Rajas preponderates prevailing over Tamas and Sattva, and sometimes Tamas preponderates prevailing over Rajas and Sattva.

He teaches that this changing preponderance of the Gunas can be inferred from the knowledge of the effects produced by them.
14.9-10 Sattvam etc. Rajah etc. Dominates fully i.e. sets  [to work].  The Sattva  flourishes by overpowering the Rajas and the Tamas.  But, the Rajas  [flourishes by overpowering] both the Sattva and the Tamas; and the Tamas [does so by overpowering] both the Sattva and the Rajas.  That has been stated :
 
'The Strands augment by overpowering each other'.
14.10 O scion of the Bharata dynasty, sattva bhavati, increases, comes into being; abhibhuya, by subduing both rajas and tamas. When sattva increases, then, coming to its own, it produces its own effects-knowledge, happiness, etc. Similarly, when the ality of rajas increases by overpowering both sattva and tamas, then it produces its own effects-activity and hankering. When the ality called tamas increases by similarly dominating over sattva and rajas, it then produces its own effects-obscuring of knowledge, etc.
When any ality preponderates, then what is its indication? This is being answered:
14.11 When through every gate (sense) in this body, the wisdom-light shines, then it may be known that Sattva is predominant.
14.11 When the light of knowledge gleams forth from all the gates of the body, then be sure that Purity prevails.
14.11. When the knowledge-light arises in all the gates in this body, then one should also know that the Sattva has increased predominantly.
14.11 When knowledge as light illumines from all gateways (i.e., the senses), then, one should know that Sattva prevails.
14.11 When the illumination that is knowledge radiates in this body through all the doors (of the senses), then one should know that sattva has increased greatly.
14.11 When the light of knowledge shines revealing the truth of things emerging through all the gateways of knowledge such as the eyes etc., in the body, one should know that Sattva is prevailing.
14.11 See Comment under 14.13
14.11 Yada, when; prakasah, the illumination-prakasa, illumination, is a function of the internal organ, intelligence; that itself is jnanam, knowledge; when this illumination called knowledge upajayate, radiates; asmin, in this; dehe, body; sarva-dvaresu, through all the doors-all the sense organs, (viz) ear etc., are the Self's doors of perception; through all those doors; tada, then; through this indication, viz the illumination that is knowledge, vidyat, one should know; iti, that; sattva has vivrddham, increased; uta, greatly [See A.G.-Tr.].
This is the characteristics of rajas when it has become prominent:
14.12 Greed, activity, the undertaking of actions, restlessness, longing  these arise when Rajas is predominant, O Arjuna.
14.12 O best of Indians! Avarice, the impulse to act and the beginning of action itself are all due to the dominance of Passion.
14.12. Greed, exertion, undertaking of actions, unrest, and craving-these are born when the Rajas increases predominantly, O chief of the Bharatas !
14.12 Greed, activity, undertaking of work, unrest and longing - these arise, O Arjuna, when Rajas prevails.
14.12 O best of the Bharata dynasty, when rajas becomes predominant, these come into being: avarice, movement, undertaking of actions, unrest and hankering.
14.12 'Greed' is the tendency not to spend one's own property. 'Activity' is the disposition to be active devoid of any purpose. 'Undertaking of works' is engagement in works which yield fruits. 'Unrest' is absence of rest of sense-activities. 'Longing' is the desire for sense objects. These predominate when Rajas has increased. The meaning is that whenever greed etc., prevail, then one should know that Rajas has very much increased.
14.12 See Comment under 14.13
14.12 O best of the Bharata dynasty, when the ality of rajas vivrddhe, becomes predominant; etani, these indications; jayante, come into being; lobhah, avarice, the desire to appropriate other's possessions; pravrtih, movement in general; arambhah, undertaking;-of what?-karmanam, of actions; asamah, unrest, lack of tranillity-(i.e.) manifestation of joy, attachment, etc.; and sprha, hankering, desire in general for all things.
14.13 Darkness, inertness, heedlessness and delusion  these arise when Tamas is predominant, O Arjuna.
14.13 Darkness, stagnation, folly and infatuation are the result of the dominance of Ignorance, O joy of the Kuru-clan!
14.13. Absence of [mental]  illumination, non-excertion, negligence and mere delusion-these are born when the Tamas is on the increase predominantly, O darling of the Kurus !
14.13 Non-illumination, inactivity, negligence and even delusion - these arise, O Arjuna, when Tamas prevails.
14.13 O descendant of the Kuru dynasty, when tamas predominates these surely [i.e. without exception.-M.S.] come into being: non-discrimination and inactivity, inadvertence and delusion.
14.13 'Non-illumination' is the absence of knowledge. 'Inactivity' is immovableness. 'Negligence' is inadvertence resulting in works that should not be done. 'Delusion' is wrong knowledge. These arise when Tamas waxes strong. By these, one should know that the Tamas has increased very much.
14.11-13 Sarva-etc.  upto kurunandana. In all the gates : in all the sense-organs. Greed etc., are born in succession when  the Rajas dominates.  Similarly, absence of mental illumination and so on arise in succession only at the time of the increase of the Tamas.
14.13 Kuru-nandana, O descendant of the Kuru dynasty; when the ality of tamas vivrddhe, predominates; etani, these indications; eva, surely; jayante, come into being; extreme aprakasah, non-discrimination; and apravrttih, inactivity; its [i.e. of non-discrimination.] effects, pramadah, in-advertence; and mohah, delusion, i.e. stupidity, which is a from of non-discrimination.
Whatever result is achieved even after death, that is also owing to attachment and desire; every-thing is certainly caused by the alities. By way of showing this the Lord says:
14.14 If the embodied one meets with death when Sattva is predominant, then he attains to the spotless worlds of the knowers of the Highest.
14.14 When Purity prevails, the soul on quitting the body passes on to the pure regions where live those who know the Highest.
14.14. But, if the body-bearer dies at the time when Sattva is on the increase, then he attains to the spotless worlds of those, who know the Highest.
14.14 If the embodied self meets with dissoution when Sattva prevails, then It proceeds to the pure worlds of those who know the highest.
14.14 When an embodied one undergoes death while sattva is exclusively prodominant, then he attains the taintless worlds of those who know the highest (entities).
14.14 When the 'Sattva prevails' i.e., while the Sattva continues to be prevalent, if the embodies self meets with death, It reaches the pure worlds, i.e., regions conducive to the knowledge of the self. The purport is this:  If Satva preponderates in a person at the time of death, he will be rorn in the families of those who have the knowledge of the self, and thus be alified to perform auspicious acts which are the means of attaining the true knowledge of the self.
14.14 See Comment under 14.15
14.14 Yada, when; deha-bhrt, an embodied one, the soul; yati, undergoes; pralayam, death; sattve pravrddhe, while sattva is predominant; tu, exclusively; [Tu is used to exclude rajas and tamas.-S.] tada, then; pratipadyate, he attains, i.e. gains; the amalan, tainless, stainless; lokan, worlds; [The worlds of Brahma, etc., which are free from the impurity of predominance either of rajas or tamas.] uttamavidam, of those who know the highest, i.e. of those who have known the principles-mahat and the rest.
14.15 Meeting death in Rajas, he is born among those who are attached to action; and dying in Tamas, he is born in the womb of the senseless.
14.15 When Passion prevails, the soul is reborn among those who love activity; when Ignorance rules, it enters the wombs of the ignorant.
14.15. By meeting death when the Rajas [is on the increase], he is born among those who are attached to action; likewise meeting death when the Tamas [is on the increase], he is born in the wombs of the duluded.
14.15 (a) Meeting with dissolution when Rajas is prevalent, one is born among those attached to work৷৷.

 (b) Similarly, one who has met with dissolution when Tamas prevails, is born in the womb of beings lacking in intelligence.
14.15 When one dies while rajas predominates, he is born among people attached to activity. Similarly, when one dies while tamas predominates, he takes birth among the stupid species.
14.15 (a) Meeting with death when Rajas is preponderant, one is rorn in the families of those who act for the sake of fruits for themselves. Being rorn in such families, he becomes alified to perform auspicious acts which constitute the way for attaining heaven and the like.

(b) Similarly, one who dies when Tamas is preponderant is born in the wombs of beings lacking in intelligence, namely, in the wombs of dogs, pigs etc. The meaning is that he is rorn as one incapable of realising any human end.
14.14-15 Yada etc. Rajasi etc. When the Sattva is predominantly on the increase on account of increase on account on account of incessantly practising actions of the Sattva throughout the entire life-at that [time] having met dissolution  [of body], one attains the auspicious worlds.  Likewise whosoever has practised throughout his life the activities of the Rajas, he, by his [last] journey attains manhood for mixed  enjoyment.  Likewise : i.e. in the same order, if one practises action of the Tamas alone by one's entire life, then [on his death] he is rorn in the bodies of the hell, of the animals, of the trees and so on.
 
Those, who explain  [the passage under study to the effect] :  'These results [are for him in whom] the Sattva etc., have predominantly increased only at the time of death' - these commentators have not correctly entered into (grasped) the behaviour of the embodied.  For, nothing but delusion arises, by all means at the last moment, without exception in the case of one and all.  However, with regard to our explanation  [given above] these passages and other verses  (Ch. VIII, 5ff) speak in one voice.
14.15 Pralayam gatva, when one does; rajasi, while the ality of rajas predominates; jayate, he is born; karma-sangisu, among people attached to activity, among human beings having attachment to work. Tatha, similarly, in that very way; pralinah, when one dies; tamasi, while tamas predominates; jayate, he takes birth; mudha-yonisu, among the stupid species, such as animals etc.
A summary of the idea of the preceding (three) verses is being stated:
14.16 The fruit of good action, they say, is Sattvic and pure, verily the fruit of Rajas is pain, and ignorance is the fruit of Tamas.
14.16 They say the fruit of a meritorious action is spotless and full of purity; the outcome of Passion is misery, and of Ignorance darkness.
14.16. The fruit of good action, they say, is spotless and is of the Sattva; but the fruit of the Rajas is pain, and the fruit of the Tamas is ignorance.
14.16 The fruits of a good deed, they say, is pure and is of the nature of Sattva. But the fruit of Rajas is pain; and the fruit of Tamas is ignorance.
14.16 They say that the result of good work is pure and is born of sattva. But the result of rajas is sorrow; the result of tamas is ignorance.
14.16 Thus, the 'fruit of a good deed,' namely, disinterested work in the form of My worship, performed by one who dies when Sattva prevails - is birth in the family of those who know the self. There he acires more Sattva than before and the self becomes more pure, namely, devoid of the slightest vestige of suffering. So say those who know about the development of Sattva. But the 'fruit of Rajas,' dominating at the time of death, is 'suffering in Samsara.' In consists in successive births in families attached to actions for the sake of fruits. Rirth of this type increases Rajas further, resulting in actions for gaining their fruits. So say those who know about the developments of this Guna. 'Ignorance' is the result of Tamas. The fruit of Tamas dominating at the time of death, is successive conditions of ignorance.

What are the results derived from Sattva etc.?  To this, He answers:
14.16 See Comment under 14.20
14.16 Ahuh, they, the wise persons, say; that phalam, the result; sukrtasya, of good; karmanah, work, i.e. acts having the sattva ality; is verily nirmalam, pure; and is sattvikam, born of sattva. Tu, but; phalam, the result; rajasah, of rajas, i.e. of acts that have the alitty of rajas-for the topic relates to actions; is duhkham, sorrow. In accordance with its cause, the result too is indeed sorrow, a product of rajas. So also ajnanam, ignorance; is, as before, (the result) tamasah, of tamas, of unrighteous acts that have the ality of tamas.
What else results from the alities?
14.17 From Sattva arises knowledge, and greed from Rajas; heedlessness and delusion arise from Tamas, and also ignorance.
14.17 Purity engenders Wisdom, Passion avarice, and Ignorance folly, infatuation and darkness.
14.17. From the Sattva arises wisdom; from the Rajas only greed; and from the Tamas arise negligence, delusion and also ignorance.
14.17 From the Sattva arises knowledge, and from Rajas greed, from Tamas arise negligence and delusion, and, indeed ignorance.
14.17 From sattva is born knowledge [Knowledge acired through the sense-organs.], and from rajas, verily, avarice. From tamas are born inadvertence and delusion as also ignorance, to be sure.
14.17 From the increase of Sattva, knowledge i.e., 'true and direct knowledge' of the self arises. From Rajas develops likewise 'intense desire' for heaven etc. From Tamas similarly develops 'negligence' leading to evil deeds; and from this, delusion, i.e., erroneous knowledge; and from that still more Tamas; and thence ignorance, namely absence of knowledge.
14.17 See Comment under 14.20
14.17 Sattvat, from sattva, when it predominates; sanjayate, is born; jnanam, knowledge; and rajasah, from rajas; is verily born lobhah, avarice. Tamasah, from tamas; bhavatah, are born; both pramada-mohau, in-advertence and delusion; as also ajnanam, ignorance [Absence of discrimination.]; eva ca, to be sure.
Further,
14.18 Those who are seated in Sattva go upwards; the Rajasic dwell in the middle; and the Tamasic, abiding in the function of the lowest Guna, go downwards.
14.18 When Purity is in the ascendant, the man evolves; when Passion, he neither evolves nor degenerates; when Ignorance, he is lost.
14.18. Those who are established in the Sattva, go upward; the persons given to the Rajas,  remain in the middle [state];  those who are given to the Tamas, being established in the tendencies of bad alities, go downwards.
14.18 Those who rest in Sattva rise upwards; those who abide in Rajas remain in the middle; and those, abiding in the tendencies of Tamas go downwards.
14.18 People who conform to sattva go higher up; those who conform to rajas stay in the middle; those who conform to tamas, who conform to the actions of the lowest ality, go down.
14.18 Thus, in the manner explained, those who 'rest in Sattva rise upwards,' namely, they attain liberation from the bonds of Samsara gradually. Those who, 'abiding in Rajas' which produces greed for heaven etc., engage themselves in actions which constitute the means for obtaining such results. Experiencing those results, they are born again and engage in, and perform, the very same acts. So they remain in the 'middle'. This is mostly suffering, as it is characterised by rirths. Those of Tamasic nature 'stoop down' into lower levels, as Tamas grows ever worse in them. They go 'downwards' i.e., to the lowest state among human beings, then to the condition of animals; then to that of worms; insects etc., then of immovable things, and even to the condition of shrubs and creepers, and ultimately to the condition of stones, wood, clod of earth, straw etc.

Sri Krsna now teaches about the manner of those in whom the Sattva has gradually increased by adopting special holy food and performance of special disinterested deeds, and who thus rise upward by transcending the Gunas.
14.18 See Comment under 14.20
14.18 Sattvasthah, people who conform to sattva, to the actions of sattva ality; gacchanti, go, are born; undhavam, higher up, in the worlds of gods and others. Rajasah, those who conform to rajas; [Those who are endowed with sense-knowledge and actions conseent on the preponderance of rajas.] tisthanti, stay, are born; madhye, in the middle, among human beings. Tamasah, those who conform to tamas, jaghanya-gunavrttasthah [A variant reading is vrttisthah.-Tr.], who conform to actions of the lowest ality of tamas, those who are attached to its actions-sleep, laziness, etc.-, the foolish; gacchanti, go; adhah, down, (i.e.) they are born among cattle etc.
The association, owing to the false ignorance in the form of 'being seated in Nature', that an individual soul has with the gunas-in the form of happiness, sorrow and delusion, and which are matters of experience in such ways as, 'I am happy,' 'I am sorrowful,' 'I am ignorant,'-that (association) is the cause of the individual soul's mundane existence characterized by coming to have births in good and bad species. This was stated briefly in the earlier chapter. Elaborating that here in the text beginning with, 'the alities, viz sattva, rajas and tamas, born of Nature' (5), the Lord has said that the nature of the alities, the conduct conforming to the alities, and the power to bind that the alities have through actions conforming to them, and also the course of a person under the bondage, of behaviour conforming to the alities,-all this is false knowledge; it has ignorance as its root and is the cause of bondage.
Now, it is necessary to state that Liberation follows from right knowledge. Hence the Lord says:
14.19 When the seer beholds no agent other than the Gunas and knows That which is higher than they, he attains to My Being.
14.19 As soon as man understands that it is only the Qualities which act and nothing else, and perceives That which is beyond, he attains My divine nature.
14.19. When the Perceiver (the Self)  finds no agent  other than the Strands, and realises That which is beyond the Strands, then he attains My state.
14.19 When the seer beholds no agent of action other than the Gunas, and knows what transcends the Gunas, he attains to My state.
14.19 When the witness sees none other than the alities as the agent, and knows that which is superior [i.e. different from.] to the alities, he attains My nature.
14.19 The seer has in the first place to totally subdue his Rajas and Tamas and stay in pure Sattva. This is accomplished through nourishment by Sattvika food and the performance of disinterested actions for the propitiation of the Lord. He then perceives 'no agent of action other than the Gunas' i.e., sees that the Gunas are themselves the agents according to their nature. Further he perceives what is 'other than the Gunas,' i.e., perceives the Gunas which are agents and the self who is not an agent of action. Such a seer attains to 'My state,' i.e., gains likeness with Me in transcending the three Gunas etc. The purport is this:  The self, pure in nature by Itself, gains agency through varius actions by contact with the Gunas springing from past Karmas. When one perceives the self in this way, namely, that the self by Itself is no agent of actions and is of the nature of infinite knowledge, then It attains to My likeness.

It is stated that one attains to the likeness of the Lord after perceiving the self as a non-agent and as other than the Gunas. What is meant by the state of likeness to the Lord?  Sri Krsna now describes it:
14.19 See Comment under 14.20
14.19 Yada, when; drasta, the witness, after becoming illumined; anupasyati, sees; na anyam, none other; gunhyah, than the alities that have transformed into the shape of body, orgnas and objects; kartaram,as the agent-(i.e.) he sees thus that the alities themselves, in all their modes, are the agents of all activities; ca, and; vetti, knows; that which, standing as the witness of the activities of the alities, is param, superior; gunhyah, to the alities; sah, he, the witness; adhigacchati, attains; madbhavam, My nature.
How does he attain? That is being stated:
14.2 They who, having taken refuge in this knowledge, have attained to unity with Me, are neither born at the time of creation nor are they disturbed at the time of dissolution.
14.2 Dwelling in Wisdom and realising My Divinity, they are not born again when the universe is re-created at the beginning of every cycle, nor are they affected when it is dissolved.
14.2. Holding on to this knowledge, they have attained the state of having attributes common with Me; [and] they are neither born even at the time of creation [of the world], nor do they come to grief at the time of dissolution [of it].
14.2 Resorting to this knowledge, partaking of My Nature, they are not born at the time of creation, nor do they suffer at the time of dissolution.
14.2 Those who attain identity with Me by resorting of this Knowledge are not born even during creation, nor do they suffer pain during dissolution.
14.2 They, 'resorting to this knowledge' which will be expounded later, come to partake of My nature, and they attain My status. 'They are not born at the time of creation,' they are not subjected to the process of creation, and they 'suffer not at the time of dissolution,' i.e. they are not subjected to the distress involved in dissolution of the universe.

In order to show how the Gunas of Prakrti constitute the cause of bondage, Sri Krsna now declares that, the aggregation of beings, born from the conjunction of Purusa and Prakrti as stated already in the passages, 'Whatever being is born' (13.26), is brought about by the Lord Himself:
14.2 Idam etc.  Vyathanti :  The suffix tip  (Personal  Termination, Third person, Singular)  is due to Vedism.  The same may be stated in other  [similar] instances of the suffixes of Case Terminations and Personal  Terminations.		
 Now to begin with,  [the Bhagavat] speaks of the seence in the cycle  of  birth and death.  For, if what is to be abandoned is understood along with its cause then it is easy to abandon that -
14.2 Agatah, those who attain; mama sadharmyam, identity with Me the supreme God, unity with My real nature-sadharmyam, however, does not mean similarity of attributes, for, in the scripture Gita, distinction between the Knower of the field and God is not admitted; and this statement of the result is by way of eulogy-; upasritya, by resorting to i.e. by following; idam, this; jnanam, Knowledge as described, i.e., by following the means to Knowledge; na, are not; upajayante, born, produced; api, even; sarge, during creation; nor do they vyathanti, suffer pain, i.e. they do not perish; pralaye, during dissolution, when even Brahma perishes.
The Lord says that association of this kind between the field and the Knower of the field is the origin of all beings:
14.20 The embodied one having crossed beyond these three Gunas out of which the body is evolved, is freed from birth, death, decay and pain, and attains to immortality.
14.20 When the soul transcends the Qualities, which are the real cause of physical existence, then, freed from birth and death, from old age and misery, he quaffs the nectar of immortality.
14.20. Transcending these three Strands, of which the body  [etc.] is born, the Embodied (the Soul), being freed from birth, death, old age and sorrow, attains immortality.
14.20 The embodied self, crossing beyond these three Gunas which arise in the body, and freed from birth, death, age and pain, attains immortality.
14.20 Having transcended these three alities which are the origin of the body, the embodied one, becoming free from birth, death, old age and sorrows, experiences Immortality.
14.20 The embodied self - 'crossing beyond these three Gunas,' the Sattva and the rest, which 'arise in the body,' i.e., spring from Prakrti transformed into the form of the body - perceives the self as different from the Gunas and as of the form of knowledge only. Released thus from birth, death, old age and sorrow, It experiences the immortal self. This is what is meant by My likeness.

Arjuna now wants to know about the characteristics of one who has transcended the Gunas and the means of such transcendence:
14.16-20 Karmanah etc. upto asnute.  Here, there are certain unconnected verses that have been concocted.  They are of the nature of repetition, and hence they have to be necessarily rejected.  A mode of life transcending these Strands turn to be nothing but emancipation.
14.20 Atitya, having transcended, having gone beyond-even while living; etan, these; trin, three; gunan, alities as have been described, which constitute the limiting adjunct Maya; and dehasamudbhavan, which are the origin of the body, which are the seed of the birth of the body; dehi, the embodied one, the enlightened one; vimuktah, becoming free-even in this life; janma-mrtyu-jara-duhkhaih, from birth death, old age and sorrow; asnute, experiences; [Some translate this as 'attains'.-Tr.] amrtam, Immortality. In this way he attains My nature. This is the idea.
Getting a clue to a estion from the statement that one experiences Immortality, even in this life, by going beyond the alities-
14.21 Arjuna said  What are the marks of him who has transcended the three alities, O Lord? What is his conduct and how does he go beyond these three alities?
14.21 Arjuna asked: My Lord! By what signs can he who has transcended the Qualities be recognized? How does he act? How does he live beyond them?
14.21. Arjuna said  O Master !  with what characteristic marks does he, who has transcended these three Strands, exist ?  Of what behaviour is he ?  And, how does he pass beyond these three Strands ?
14.21 Arjuna said  What are the marks of a man who has crossed beyond the three Gunas?  What is his behaviour?  And how does he cross beyond the three Gunas?
14.21 Arjuna said  O Lord, by what signs is one (known) who has gone beyond these three alities? What is his behaviour, and how does he transcend these three alities?
14.21 Arjuna said  By what signs, namely, distinguishing features, is a man who has crossed beyond these three Gunas, Sattva and the rest, characterised?  What is his behaviour?  With what kind of behaviour is he associated and how does it serve as a sign for knowing his state?  Such is the meaning. How does he, i.e., by what means does he cross beyond the three Gunas, the Sattva and the rest?
14.21 Kaih etc. But, if he has a body then how could he have transcended the Strands ?  He lives certainly in one way or other with some mental modification, which is necessarily one a among the three Strands, With this intention Arjuna raises the estion.									
 Now [by way of  giving] answer -
14.21 Prabho, O Lord; kaih, by what; lingaih, signs; bhavati, is one (known); atitah, who has gone beyond; etan, these; trin, three; gunan, alities that have been explained? Kim, what; is his acarah, behaviour; ca, and; katham, how, in what way; ativartate, does he transcend; [Ast. adds here, 'atitya vartate, (in what way) does he exist after transcending (the three alities)?'-Tr.] etan, these; trin, three; gunan, alities?
In this verse the signs of one who has gone beyond the alities, and the means of transcending them have been asked by Arjuna. By way of replying to the two estions, the Lord said: 'As for the estion, 'With what sings does one who has gone beyond the alities become endowed with?", listen to them:'
14.22 The Blessed Lord said  When light, activity and delusion are present, he hates them not, nor does he long for them when they are absent.
14.22 Lord Shri Krishna replied: O Prince! He who shuns not the Quality which is present, and longs not for that which is absent;
14.22. The Bhagavat said  O son of Pandu !  He does niether abhor nor crave for illumination, and exertion, and delusion too, as and when they arise or cease to be.
14.22 The Lord said  He hates not illumination, nor activity nor even delusion, O Arjuna, while these prevail, nor longs for them when they cease.
14.22 The Blessed Lord said  O son of Pandu, he neither dislikes illumination (knowledge), activity and delusion when they appear, nor does he long for them when they disappear.
14.22 The Lord said  He does not hate the effects of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas known as illumination, activity and delusion respectively, when they are prevailing in regard to undesired things other than the self; nor longs for them when they cease, i.e., when desired things other than the self become unavailable. Hating things not conducive to the realisations of the self and longing for things conducive thereof, do not come under this law stated in the Verse.
14.22 Prakasam etc.  Of course the illumination etc., do exist in all as their respective attributive marks.  Yet, the men of Yoga do not rejoices in these illumination etc. Nor do they have any hatred [for them]. On the other hand, contemplating  'These exist as attributes merely of the body; and they are not capable of disturbing me.',  these persons transcend the Strands.						
 Hence  [the Bhagavat] says -
14.22 Na dvesti, he neither dislikes these; prakasam, illumination (knowledge), an effect of sattva; pravrttim, activity, an effect of rajas; and moham, delusion, an effect of tamas; sampravrttani, when they appear, when they fully emerge in the form of objects (of experience)-.
'In me has arisen a perception which is a result of tamas; thery I have become deluded'; so also, 'In me has risen (the inclination to) action which is painful and is born of rajas. By that rajas I have been actuated, carried away from my own nature. This is a matter of sorrow to me that there has been a deviation from my own nature'; similarly, 'The ality of sattva, in the form of illumination that is knowledge, binds me by attributing discrimination to me and making me attached to happiness'-(by thinking) in these ways one dislikes them because of his being not fully enlightened. The person who has transcended the alities does not dislike them in this manner.
Unlike a person having sattva etc., who longs for the effects of sattva etc. which withdraw themselves after becoming manifest to him, the person who has gone beyond the alities na kanksati, does not long for them in that way; nivrttani, when they disappear. This is the idea.
This is not an indication that can be perceived by others. What then? Since this characteristic is perceivable to oneself, it is merely subjective. For dislike or longing, which is a subjective experience of a person, is not seen by another.
Now, then, the Lord gives the reply to the estion, 'What is the behaviour of one who has gone beyond the alities?':
14.23 He who, seated like one unconcerned, is not moved by the alities, and who, knowing that the alities are active, is self-centred and moves not.
14.23 He who maintains an attitude of indifference, who is not disturbed by the Qualities, who realises that it is only they who act, and remains calm;
14.23. He who, sitting like an unconcerned person, is not perturbed by the Strands; who is ignorant that the Strands exist; (or who remain simply aware that the Strands [alone] exist) who is not shaken;
14.23 He who sits like one unconcerned, undisturbed by the Gunas; who knows, 'It is the Gunas that move,' and so rests unshaken;
14.23 He who, sitting like one indifferent, is not distracted by the three alities; he who, thinking that the alities alone act, remains firm and surely does not move;
14.23 He who sits like one 'unconcerned,' namely, whose satisfaction consists in the vision of the self as different from the Gunas and sits like one unconcerned about other things and is not therefore disturbed by the Gunas through hatred and longing and who remains iet, reflecting:  'The Gunas function in their effects like illumination etc., and so 'rests unshaken,' i.e, does not act in accordance with the effects of the Gunas.
14.23 See Comment under 14.25
14.23 He, the Self-realized monk, yah, who; asinah, sitting; udasinavat, like one indifferent-as an indifferent man sides with nobody, similarly, this one, set on the path leading to the transcendence of the alities; na, is not; vicalyate, distracted from the state of Knowledge arising out of discrimination; gunaih, by the alities. This point is being clarified as such: Yah, he who; thinking iti, that; gunah, the alities, which have trasnformed into body, organs and objects; vartante, act on one another; avatisthati, remains firm-avatisthati (instead of avatisthate) is used in the Parasmaipada to avoid a break in the metre, or there is different reading, 'yah anutisthati, who acts'-;[His apparent activity consists in the mere continuance of actions which have been subjectively sublated through enlightenment.] and an, does not; ingate, move; i.e., becomes eva, surely settled in his own nature-.
14.24 Who is the same in pleasure and pain, who dwells in the Self, to whom a clod of earth, stone and gold are alike, who is the same to the dear and the unfriendly, who is firm, and to whom censure and praise are as one.
14.24 Who accepts pain and pleasure as it comes, is centred in his Self, to whom a piece of clay or stone or gold are the same, who neither likes nor dislikes, who is steadfast, indifferent alike to praise or censure;
14.24. To whom pain, pleasure and sleep are alike; to whom a cold, a stone and a lump of gold are alike; to whom both the pleasant and the unpleasant things are eal; who is firm [in mind]; to whom blame and personal commendation are eal;
14.24 He who is alike in pleasure and pain, who dwells in his self, who looks upon a clod, a stone and piece of gold as of eal value, who remains the same towards things dear and hateful and who is intelligent, who regards both blame and praise of himself as eal;
14.24 He to whom sorrow and happiness are alike, who is established in his own Self, to whom a lump of earth, iron and gold are the same, to whom the agreeable and the disagreeable are the same, who is wise, to whom censure and his own praise are the same;
14.24 - 14.25 He who is 'alike in pleasure and pain,' namely, whose mind is eal in pleasure and pain; 'who dwells in his self,' namely, who dwells in his self because his love for the self keeps his mind in eanimity in pleasure and pain arising from the birth, death etc., of his sons and other relatives and friends, and who, because of this, 'looks upon a clod, a stone and a piece of gold as of eal value,' who conseently remains the same towards things dear or hateful, i.e., who treats alike the worldly objects desired and undesired; who is 'intelligent,' namely, proficient in discrimination between the Prakrti and the self; who, therefore, regards blame and praise as alike, namely, who treats with eality praise and blame looking upon good and evil alities as born of identification with bodies such as those of men etc., and as such unconnected with his real self; who is the 'same in honour and dishonour' because these are feelings based on the misconception that the body is the self, and as a conseence of such discrimination between the body and the self, 'looks alike on friend and foe,' because he understands that ther is no connection between them and himself; and who has thus abandoned all entrprises in which embodied beings are involved - he who is like this, is said to have risen above the Gunas.

Now Sri Krsna states the main method (technie) for transcending such Gunas:
14.24 See Comment under 14.25
14.24 Moreover, sama-duhkha-sukhah, he to whom sorrow and happiness are alike;svasthah, who is established in his own Self, tranil; sama-losta-asma-kancanah, to whom a lump of earth, iron and gold are the same; tulya-priya-apriyah, to whom the agreeable and the disagreeable are the same; dhirah, who is wise; tulya-ninda-atma-samstutih, to whom, to which monk, censure and his own praise are the same-.
14.25 Who is the same in honour and dishonour, the same to friend and foe, abandoning all undertakings  he is said to have transcended the alities.
14.25 Who looks equally upon honour and dishonour, loves friends and foes alike, abandons all initiative, such is he who transcends the Qualities.
14.25. Who remains eal to honour and to dishonour, and eal to the sides of [both] the friend and the foe; and who has given up all fruits of his initiatives-he is said to have transcended the Strands.
14.25 He who is the same in honour and dishonour, and the same to friend and foe, and how has abandoned all enterprises - he is said to have risen above the Gunas.
14.25 He who is the same under honour and dishonour, who is eally disposed both towards the side of the friend and of the foe, who has renounced all enterprise,-he is said to have gone beyond the alities.
14.24 - 14.25 He who is 'alike in pleasure and pain,' namely, whose mind is eal in pleasure and pain; 'who dwells in his self,' namely, who dwells in his self because his love for the self keeps his mind in eanimity in pleasure and pain arising from the birth, death etc., of his sons and other relatives and friends, and who, because of this, 'looks upon a clod, a stone and a piece of gold as of eal value,' who conseently remains the same towards things dear or hateful, i.e., who treats alike the worldly objects desired and undesired; who is 'intelligent,' namely, proficient in discrimination between the Prakrti and the self; who, therefore, regards blame and praise as alike, namely, who treats with eality praise and blame looking upon good and evil alities as born of identification with bodies such as those of men etc., and as such unconnected with his real self; who is the 'same in honour and dishonour' because these are feelings based on the misconception that the body is the self, and as a conseence of such discrimination between the body and the self, 'looks alike on friend and foe,' because he understands that ther is no connection between them and himself; and who has thus abandoned all entrprises in which embodied beings are involved - he who is like this, is said to have risen above the Gunas.

Now Sri Krsna states the main method (technie) for transcending such Gunas:
14.23-25 Udasinavad etc. upto ucyate. He, who is ignorant i.e.,  he who does not distinguish  [even the existence and nonexistence of the Strands] - he alone is wise, because of his correct  knowledge.  That is why he is not shaken i.e., he does not fall from his own nature.  The means in this regard is the firm conviction :  'The exertion that  [in found in my body etc.] is nothing but the innate nature of the body, the sense-organs etc.; and I am unconcerned with any fruit  [of any action]'.
14.25 Further, tulyah, he who is the same, unperturbed; mana-apamanayoh, under honour and dishonour; tulyah, who is eally disposed; mitra-ari-paksayoh, both towards the side of the friend and of the foe-although from their own standpoint some may be unattached, still, in others' view they may appear to be siding either with friends or foes; hence it is said, 'eally disposed both towards the side of the friend and of the foe'; sarva-arambha-parityagi, who has renounced all enterprise (-those which are undertaken are arambhah, actions intended for seen or unseen results-), i.e. who is apt to give up all undertakings, who has given up all actions other than those needed merely for the maintenance of the body; sah, he; ucyate, is said to have; gunatitah, gone beyond the alities.
The disciplines leading to the state of transcendence of the alities, which have been stated (in the verses) beginning from 'he who, sitting like one indifferent,' and ending with 'he is said to have gone beyond the alities,' have to be practised by a monk, a seeker of Liberation, so long as they are to be achieved through effort. But when they become firmly ingrained, they become the indications, perceivable to himself, of a monk who has transcended the alities.
Now the Lord gives the reply to the estion, 'And how does he transcend the alties?'
14.26 And he who serves Me with unswerving devotion, he, crossing beyond the alities, is fit for becoming Brahman.
14.26 And he who serves Me and only Me, with unfaltering devotion, shall overcome the Qualities, and become One with the Eternal.
14.26. Whosoever serves Me alone with an unfailing devotion-Yoga, he, transcending these Strands, turns to be the Brahman.
14.26 And he who, with unswerving Bhakti Yoga, serves Me, he, crossing beyond the Gunas, becomes fit for the state of Brahman.
14.26 And he who serves Me through the unswerving Yoga of Devotion, he, having gone beyond these alities, alifies for becoming Brahman.
14.26 The state of transcendence of Gunas is not attained merely by reflecting on the difference between the Prakrti and the self as declared in the text such as, 'When the seer beholds no agent of action other than the Gunas, then he transcends the Gunas, for it is liable then to be sublated by contrary subtle impressions (Vasanas) which have continued from beginningless time. He who, with unswerving Bhakti Yoga, namely, one-pointed Bhakti Yoga, serves Me of true-resolve, supremely compassionate and the ocean of parental affection for supplicants - such a man crosses over the Gunas of Sattva etc., which are otherwise invincible. He becomes worthy for brahmabhuya, the state of brahman i.e., he becomes alified for the state of brahman. The meaning is that he attains the self as It really is, immortal and immutable.
14.26 Mam ca etc.  By this  [verse the Lord]  teaches the basic means.  Here the word ca has been used in the sense of affirmation in exclusion of all other  things.  [So the meaning  is] : 'He, who serves Me exclusively'.  Hence, craving for fruits etc.  [of action], whosoever takes hold of that fruit as his principal aim, but Me (the Supreme) as a subsidiary one-he is excluded by this interpretation. Because the devotion of this person is not unfailing.  For, he has consideration for fruit  [alone].  On the other hand, he who does not entertain any desire for any fruit; who, even when estioned  [by somody as]  'Why do you under-take this desagreeable (foolish)  act ?'  would give reply by silence alone, shedding tears that roll on his both the eyes wide open,  and having shake in body and bodily hair thrilled-[all] due to his internal organ,  agitated on account of being struck by the incessant devotion towards  the Bhagavat-it should be born in mind that this person alone, not anybody else, in purified by the unfailing devotion which is  (nothing but)  the foremost  Energy  (Grace) of the Bhagavat, the Supreme Lord.
14.26 And he-be he a monk or a man of action (rites and duties)-, yah, who; sevate, serves; mam, Me, God, Narayana residing in the hearts of all beings; avyabhicarena, through the unswerving-that which never wavers-; bhakti-yogena, Yoga of Devotion-devotion [Bhakti (devotion), supreme Love, through which one becomes united (with God) is yoga.] itself being the Yoga-; sah, he; samatitya, having transcended; etan, these; gunan, alities as described; kalpate, alifies, i.e. becomes fit; brahma-bhuyaya,-bhuyah is the same as bhavanam-, for becoming Brahman, for Liberation.
How this is so is being stated:
14.27 For I am the abode of Brahman, the immortal and the immutable, of everlasting Dharma and of absolute bliss.
14.27 For I am the Home of the Spirit, the continual Source of immortality, of eternal Righteousness and of infinite Joy."
14.27. 'I'  is the place of support for the immortal and changeless Brahman and for [Its] eternal attribute, the unalloyed Happiness.
14.27 For I am the ground of Brahman, the immortal and immutable, of eternal Dharma and of perfect bliss.
14.27 For I am the Abode of Brahman-the indestructible and immutable, the eternal, the Dharma and absolute Bliss.
14.27 The term 'hi' (for) denotes cause. I, who am to be served by unswerving Bhakti Yoga, am 'the ground of the individual self, immortal and immutable, and also of eternal Dharma,' namely, surpassing eternal prosperity and also perfect felicity, i.e., of the felicity attained by the Jnanin stated in texts such as 'Realising that Vasudeva is all' (7.19). I, being of such nature, devotion to Me helps the Jiva to transcend the Gunas. Although the expression 'eternal Dharma' is indicative of the conduct to be observed, in the given context, it means the goal to be attained; for, what follows and what precedes it, denote the goal and not conduct. The purport is this:  It has been stated that seeking refuge with the Lord is the only means for transcending the Gunas and the attainment of self-realisation, prosperity and the Supreme Being in the earlier text beginning with, 'For this divine Maya of Mine consisting of the three Gunas is hard to break through, except for those who take refuge in Me alone ৷৷.' (7.14). Thus, seeking surrender to the Lord with one-pointed mind is the only means for transcending the Gunas and for the attainment of the state of brahman through that. [Here Prapatti, surrender to the Lord, is mentioned as a limb of unswerving Bhakti Yoga according to some interpreters. This is however a disputable point, as some maintain that Prapatti is in itself an independent path].
14.27  Brahmanah  etc.  It is  'I'  who is the support of the Brhaman. [For], one becomes the [very] Brahman,  if  'I'  is served   [by him].  Otherwise if the Brahman is contemplated on - because Its nature is like that of the insentient (i.e., simply a being)-then it leads him (the seeker) to an emancipation which would simply be undistinguished from the deep sleep stage.
14.27 Hi, for; aham, I, the inmost Self; am the pratistha brahmanah, Abode-that in which something abides is pratistha-of Brahman which is the supreme Self. Of Brahman of what kind? Amrtasya, of that which is indestructible; avyayasya, of that which is immutable; and sasvatasya, of that which is eternal; dharmasya, of that which is the Dharma, realizable through the Yoga of Jnana which is called dharma (virtue); and aikantikasya sukhasya, of that which is the absolute, unfailing Bliss by nature.
Since the inmost Self is the abode of the supreme Self-which by nature is immortal etc.-, therefore, through perfect Knowledge it (the former) is realized with certainty to be the supreme Self. This has been stated in, 'he alifies for becoming Brahman'.
The purport is this: Indeed, that power of God through which Brahman sets out, comes forth, for the purpose of favouring the devotees, etc., that power which is Brahman Itself, am I. For, a power and the possesser of that power are non-different. Or, brahman means the conditioned Brahman, since It (too,) is referred to by that word. 'Of that Brahman, I Myself, the unconditioned Brahman-and none else-am the Abode.'
(The abode of Brahman) of what alities? Of that which is immortal; of that which has the ality of deathlessness; of that which is immutable; so also, of that which is the eternal; which is the dharma having the characteristics of steadfastness in Knowledge; of that which is the absolute, unestionably certain Bliss born of that (steadfastness);-'I am the Abode' is understood.
14.3 My womb is the great Brahma; in that I place the germ; thence, O Arjuna, is the birth of all beings.
14.3 The eternal Cosmos is My womb, in which I plant the seed, from which all beings are born, O Prince!
14.3. The mighty Brahman is a womb for Me; and in That I lay seed; therefrom is the birth of all beings, O descendant of Bharata !
14.3 My womb is the great brahman (i.e. Prakrti). In that I lay the germ. From that, O Arjuna, is the birth of all beings.
14.3 My womb is the great-sustainer. In that I place the seed. From that, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, occurs the birth of all things.
14.3 In that great brahman forming my womb, I lay the germ. The non-conscient Prakrti is alluded to in the text 'Earth, water, fire, air, ether, Manas, Buddhi and Ahankara - thus My Prakrti is eightfold' (7.4-5). This Prakrti is designated here by the name 'the great brahman' by reason of its being the cause of modifications like the Mahat, the Ahankara etc. In the Srutis also, here and there, even the Prakrti is designated as brahman, as in:  'He who is all-knowing, all-wise, whose austerity consists of knowledge - from Him are produced this brahman as also food, i.e., the universe of name and form' (Mun. U., 1.1.9) The higher Prakrti, which is the mass of conscient selves, alluded to in the passage, 'Know My higher Prakrti to be distinct from this; it is the life-principle' (7.5). It is here expressed by the term 'Garbha', the source or womb in which all living beings originate. I lay the germ, constituting the mass of conscious beings, in that great brahman, which is non-conscient and forms the womb. From that conjunction between the two Prakrtis, brought about by My will is brought forth the origin of all entities from Brahma down to tuft to grass.

He continues to say:  'I Myself bring about the conjunction of the conscient and unconscient Prakrtis in the manifested state of effect'.
14.3 Mama etc. For Me : [For Me]  Who am of  the nature of the inexplicable Supreme Bliss, the mighty Brahman : the Brahman that is identical with My own energy, allowing expansion [of all in It].  Taking hold of just My own energy of Self-consciousness,  I cause the beginningless tiny  [individual]  Souls to pass through the cycle of birth and  death by way of favouring them.			
 Therefore-
14.3 Mama, My own Maya, i.e. Prakrti consisting of the three alities, which belongs to Me; is the yonih, womb [Here Ast. adds 'karanam, cause' (-off all the creatures).-Tr.] for all the creatures. Since it (Prakrti) is great (mahat) as compared with all its effects, and it is the sustainer (brahma) [Prakrti is brahma since it permeates all of its own products.-A.G.] of all its own transformations, therefore the womb itself is alified as mahat brahma. Tasmin, in that, in the womb which is the great-sustainer; aham, I, God, possessed of the power in the form of the two aspects, viz the field and the Knower of the field; dadhami, place, deposit; garbham, the seed-the seed of the birth of Hiranayagarbha, te seed which is the cause of the birth of all things-; i.e., I bring the field into association with the Knower of the field who conforms to the nature of the limiting adjuncts, viz ignorance, desire and activity.
Tatah, from that, from that deposition of the seed; O scion of the Bharata dynasty, bhavati, occurs; sambhavah, the birth, origination; sarva-bhutanam, of all things, following the birth of Hiranyagarbha.
14.4 Whatever forms are produced, O Arjuna, in any womb whatsoever, the great Brahma is their womb and I am the seed-giving father.
14.4 O illustrious son of Kunti! Through whatever wombs men are born, it is the Spirit Itself that conceives, and I am their Father.
14.4. O son of Kunti !  Whatever manifestations spring up in all the wombs, of them the mighty Brahman is the womb and I am the father laying the seed.
14.4 Whatever forms are produced in any womb, O Arjuna, the Prakrti is their great womb and I am the sowing father.
14.4 O son of Kunti, whatever forms are born from all the wombs, of them the great-sustainer is the womb; I am the father who deposits the seed.
14.4 In all wombs such as those of gods, Gandharvas, Yaksas, Raksasas, men, animals, beasts, birds, serpents etc., whatever forms are generated, the brahman (Prakrti) is the 'great womb' or cause. Beginning from Mahat and ending with the five elements, Prakrti, with the mass of conscient selves imbedded by Me in it, is the cause. I am the sowing father. The meaning is that I am the imbedder of the multiplex of conscient selves according to each one's Karma.

Now, He teaches the cause of continuing births as divinities etc., of those born in this manner at the beginning of a cycle of creation. It is due to the conjunction of these beings with Prakrti, in keeping with their old Karmas:
14.4 Sarvayonisu etc. In all the wombs  (whatever gives birth to anything), the expansive Energy of the Bhagavat exists as the prime cause; and hence It is the Mother having the innate nature of giving birth to the entire world process.  But I am the Father, the Energetic, the Inexplicable.
14.4 O son of Kunti, yah, whatever; murtayah, forms-that have their parts and limbs integrated, which is characteristic of the formation of bodies; sambhavanti, are born; sarva-yonisu, from all wombs-from the wombs of gods, manes, humans, cattle, beasts, etc.; tasam, of them, of those forms; mahat brahma, the great-sustainer, which exists as all the (various) forms; is the yonih, womb, source. Aham, I, God; am the pita, father; bija-pradah, who desposits the seed, the agent of impregnation.
(Now) is being stated which are the alities and how they bind:
14.5 Purity, passion and inertia  these alities, O Arjuna, born of Nature, bind fast in the body, the embodied, the indestructible.
14.5 Purity, Passion and Ignorance are the Qualities which the Law of nature bringeth forth. They fetter the free Spirit in all beings.
14.5. The Strands, viz. the Sattva, the Rajas and the Tamas, born from the Prime Cause (the said Mother), bind the changeless Embodied (Soul) to the body, O mighty-armed One !
14.5 Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are the Gunas that arise from the Prakrti. They bind the immutable self in the body, O Arjuna.
14.5 O mighty-armed one, the alities, viz sattva, rajas and tamas, born of Nature, being the immutable embodies being to the body.
14.5 The three Gunas of Prakrti - Sattva, Rajas and Tamas - are inherent in the essential nature of Prakrti and are particular expressions of it. They can be known only through their effects such as 'brightness' etc. They are not apparent in the unevolved state of Prakrti but become apparent in its transformations as Mahat etc. They bind the self, which is conjoined with bodies such as those of divinities, men etc., composed of the modifications of Prakrti beginning with Mahat and ending with the elements. The self is immutable, i.e., It is not in Its pristine nature conjoined with the Gunas. But the Gunas bind It when residing in the body. The meaning is that they bind It by virtue of the limiting conditions of Its living in the body.

Sri Krsna proceeds to speak of the nature of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas and their modes of binding (the self):
14.5 Sattvam etc. This embodied Soul is bound fast by  Her (the Mother) by means of Her attributes of the Sattva, the Rajas and the Tamas for the  former's enjoyment that continues till his emancipation.						
 The nature of these is detailed one by one -
14.5 O mighty-armed one-who are possessed of hands which are great and mighty, and extend upto the knees, gunah, the alities are named sattva, rajas and tamas. And they, prakrti-sambhavah, born of Nature, born of Maya which belongs to God; nibadhnanti, bind, as it were; the avyayam, immutable-the immutability has been spoken of in the verse, 'Being without beginning৷৷.,' etc. (13.31); dehinam, embodied being; dehe, to the body.
The word guna is a technical term, and is not a ality like colour etc. which inhere in some substance. Nor is it meant here that ality and substance are different. Therefore they are ever dependent on the Knower of the field, just as alities are dependent (on some substance). Being of the nature of ignorance, they bind the Knower of the field, as it were. They come into being, making That (Knower) their sustainer. In this sense it is said that they bind.
Objection; Was it not said that the embodied one does not become defiled (see 13.31-2)? So, why as it contrarily said here that 'they bind'?
Reply: We have rutted this objection by using the word iva (as it were) in 'they bind, as it were'.
14.6 Of these, Sattva, which from its stainlessness is luminous and healthy, binds by attachment to happiness and by attachment to knowledge, O sinless one.
14.6 O Sinless One! Of these, Purity, being luminous, strong and invulnerable, binds one by its yearning for happiness and illumination.
14.6. Among them (the Strands) the Sattva-because it is dirtless-is illuminating and healthy; and it binds [the Embodied] by attachment to happiness and also by attachment to knowledge, O sinless one !
14.6 Of these, Sattva, being without impurity, is luminous and free from morbidity. It binds, O Arjuna, by attachment to pleasure and to knowledge.
14.6 Among them, sattva, being pure, [Nirmala, pure-transparent, i.e., capable of resisting any form of ignorance, and hence as illuminator, i.e.a revealer of Consciousness.] is an illuminator and is harmless. O sinless one, it binds through attachment to happiness and attachment to knowledge.
14.6 Of 'these', i.e., of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, the characteristic nature of the Sattva is this:  it illuminates on account of its being pure. What is called purity is to be bereft of alities which veil light and happiness. Because its nature is solely the generation of light and happiness, it constitutes the cause of light and happiness. 'Light' or illumination is enlightenment about a thing as it is. It is 'not morbid,' i.e., an effect called morbidity (disease) does not exist in its presence. The meaning is, that Sattva is the cause of health.

The Guna, called Sattva, however, binds the self by attachment to happiness and knowledge. The meaning is that it causes attachment to happiness and knowledge. When attachment to knowledge and happiness is born, one engages oneself in secular and Vedic means for securing them. Conseently, one is born in such bodies which constitute the means for realising such fruits. Hence the Sattva binds the self through attachment to happiness and knowledge. What is said is this:  Sattva generates knowledge and happiness; again it generates attachment to them.
14.6 See Comment under 14.8
14.6 Tatra, among them, among sattva etc.;-the characteristics of sattva itself is being stated first-sattva, nirmalatvat, being pure like a crystal stone;is prakasakam, an illuminator; and anamayam, harmless. Anagha, O sinless one; badhnati, it binds. How? Sukhasangena, through attachment to happiness. Bringing about the association of happiness, which is the object, with the Self, which is the subject, in the form of the idea, 'I am happy', is certainly an unreal contact with happiness. This as such is nescience, for the ality of an object cannot belong to a subject. And it has been said by the Lord that all the alities, from 'desire' to 'fortitude' (see 13.6), are, indeed, of the field, which is the object. Therefore, it is certainly through nescience, which is an attribute [In reality, though nescience has no connection with the Self, yet, since there is none other with which it can become associated and since it has no independence, therefore the Commentator imagines it as an attribute of the Self.] of the Self and has the characteristics of non-discrimination between object and subject, that sattva apparently brings about the association with happiness, which is not the Self. It makes (the Self) attached, as it were; [Here Ast. adds 'asangam saktam iva, (makes) the Unattached attached, as it were'.-Tr.] makes one not possessed of happiness as though possessed of it!
Similarly, it binds also jnana-sangena, through attachment to knowledge. [Jnana, derived in the sense of 'that through which one knows,' means an instrument of knowledge, and not Consciousness.
(S.: Knowledge arising from the study of the import of various scriptures; or, jnanam, means the scriptures, through which the supreme God is known and which leads to devotional practices, but not to steadfastness in (the absolute) Brahman.] Because of its concomitance with happiness, knowledge here is an attribute of the internal organ, the field, but not of the Self. Were it an attribute [If knowledge were a natural attribute of the Self, then there can be no estion of the latter again becoming bound through association with the former.] of the Self, there could be no contact (between it and the Self), and 'bondage' would become illogical. Association with knowledge etc. should be understood in the same sense as with happiness.
14.7 Know thou Rajas to be of the nature of passion, the source of thirst (for sensual enjoyment) and attachment; it binds fast, O Arjuna, the embodied one by attachment to action.
14.7 Passion, engendered by thirst for pleasure and attachment, binds the soul through its fondness for activity.
14.7. You should know that the Rajas is of the nature of desire and is a source of craving-attachment; and it binds the embodied by the attachment to action, O son of  Kunti !
14.7 Know, O Arjuna, that Rajas is of the nature of passion springing from thirst and atttachment. It binds the embodied self with attachment to work.
14.7 Know rajas to be of the nature of passion, born of hankering and attachment. O son of Kunti, that binds the embodied one through attachment to action.
14.7 Rajas is of the nature of passion, namely, it causes sexual desire. 'Passion' (Raga) is mutual yearning between a man and a woman. 'Springing from thirst and attachment' means it is the source of sensuality and attachment. 'Trsna', (thirst, sensuality) is the longing for all sense-objects, such as sound etc. 'Sanga' (attachment) is the inordinate longing for union with one's sons, friends and such other relations. By creating longing for actions, it binds the embodied self. Whatever actions have been begun by the self from longiing for sensual enjoyments, they become the cause of births in bodies that constitute the means for experiencing such enjoyments. Therefore Rajas binds the embodied self through attachment to actions. What is said is this:  Rajas is the cause of sexuality, sensuality and attachment, and of constant engagement in actions.
14.7 See Comment under 14.8
14.7 Viddhi, know; rajas to be ragatmakam, of the nature of passion (-raga is derived in the sense of that which colours-), having the property of colouring, like the ochre pigment etc.; trsna-asanga-samud-bhavam, born of hankering and attachment-hankering is the longing for things not acired; attachment is the clining-of the nature of fondness-of the mind to things in possession. O son of Kunti, tat, that, that rajas; nibadhnati, binds; dehinam, the embodied one; karma-sangena, through attachment to actions. Deep involvement in actions related to seen or unseen objects is karmasangah. Rajas binds through that.
14.8 But know thou Tamas to be born of ignorance, deluding all embodied beings; it binds fast, O Arjuna, by heedlessness, indolence and sleep.
14.8 But Ignorance, the product of darkness, stupefies the senses in all embodied beings, binding them by chains of folly, indolence and lethargy.
14.8. But, you should  [also]  know that the Tamas is born of ignorance and is a deluder of all the Embodied; it binds [them] by negligence, laziness and sleep, O descendant of Bharata !
14.8 Know that Tamas is born of false knowledge and deludes all embodied selves. It binds, O Arjuna, with negligence, indolence and sleep.
14.8 On the other hand, know tamas, which deludes all embodied beings, to be born of ignorance. O scion of the Bharata dynasty, that binds through inadvertence, laziness and sleep.
14.8 By 'false knowledge' is here to be understood as what is other than knowledge. What is called knowledge is right perception of things. What is other than this is false knowledge. And Tamas springs from knowledge contrary to the true nature of thinngs. It deludes all embodied selves. Delusion is erroneous knowledge. The meaning is that Tamas is the cause of erroneous knowledge. Being the cause of negligence, indolence and sleep, it binds the embodied self through them. 'Negligence' is inattentiveness, which causes one to perform works other than what ought to be done. 'Indolence' is the tendency to avoid work; it may even develop into absolute inaction. 'Sleep.' is the state in which the external organs stop working due to exhaustion and seek to recover from the same. In sleep when only the outgoing actionof the senses stop, it is called dream state. When even the mind (Manas) ceases to function, it is called dreamless sleep.

He states the cardinal feature forming the ways of bondage through Sattva etc.
14.6-8 Tatra etc. upto Bharata.  The Sattva is dirtless.  [Source of craving-attachment] :  that from which the attachment of craving springs up.  Negligence :  wasting the human birth which is difficult to get, but got by means of hundreds of merits accumulated for a very long period, and which is the sole means for attaining emancipation.  That has been also said-
 'Not even a single moment of life is gained by  (spending] all the gems.  [Hence],  he, who wastes it, is a man of negligence and is the lowest of men'.
 
Laziness : i.e., in doing good deeds.  Sleep :  being poor totally i.e. a contemptible course.
14.8 Viddhi, know; tamas, the third alitty; mahanam, which deludes, which is a cause of indiscrimination; sarva-dehinam, of all embodied beings; to be ajnanajam, born of ignorance. O scion of the Bharata dynasty, tat, that tamas; nibadhnati, binds; pramada-alasya-nidrabhih, through inadvertence, laziness and sleep.
The activities of the alities are again being briefly stated:
14.9 Sattva attaches to happiness, Rajas to action, O Arjuna, while Tamas verily shrouding knowledge attaches to heedlessness.
14.9 Purity brings happiness, Passion commotion, and Ignorance, which obscures wisdom, leads to a life of failure.
14.9. O descendant of Bharata !  The Sattva fully dominates [the Embodied] in the field of happiness; the Rajas in action; but the Tamas also totally dominates in the field of negligence, by veiling knowledge.
14.9 Sattva generates attachment to pleasure, Rajas to action, O Arjuna. But Tamas, veiling knowledge, generates attachment to negligence.
14.9 O scion of the Bharata dynasty, sattva attaches one to happiness, rajas to action, while tamas, covering up knowledge, leads to inadvertence also.
14.9 Sattva mainly attaches one to pleasure. Rajas mainly attaches one to actions. But Tamas, veiling knowledge of true things and being the cause of false knowledge, mainly attaches one to actions which are contrary to those which ought to be done.

The Sattva and other alities evolve from the nature of Prakrti, developed into the form of the body. Owing to this fact that they have evolved out of the nature of Prakrti, they always co-exist in bodies at all time. How, then, can they cause effects which are mutually contrary?  He replies:
14.9 See Comment under 14.10
14.9 O scion of the Bharata dynasty, sattva, sanjayati, attaches one; sukhe, to happiness; rajas (-attaches is understood-) karmani, to action; tu, while; tamas, avrtya, covering up, veiling; jnanam, knowledge, the discrimination produced by sattva; sanjayati, leads pramade, to inadvertence; uta, also. Pramada means non-performance of a duty on hand.
When do the alities produce the effects stated above? That is being answered:
15.1 The Blessed Lord said  They (the wise) speak of the indestructible peepul tree having its root above and branches below, whose leaves are the metres or hymns: he who knows it is a knower of the Vedas.
15.1 "Lord Shri Krishna continued: This phenomenal creation, which is both ephemeral and eternal, is like a tree, but having its seed above in the Highest and its ramifications on this earth below. The scriptures are its leaves, and he who understands this, knows.
15.1. The Bhagavat said  [The scriptures]  speak of a non-perishing holy Fig-tree, which has root that is high (or above)  and branches that are low (or below) and of which the [Vedic] hymns are leaves-he who knows this (Tree) is the knower of the Vedas;
15.1 The Lord said  They speak of an immutable Asvattha tree with its roots above and branches below. Its leaves are the Vedas. He who knows it knows the Vedas.
15.1 The Blessed Lord said  They say that the peepul Tree, which has its roots upward and the branches downward, and of which the Vedas are the leaves, is imperishable. He who realizes it is knower of the Vedas.
15.1 The Lord said  The Vedas speak of the imperishable 'Asvattha tree' called Samsara, which has its 'roots above and branches below', in such passages as the following:  This Asvattha tree with its roots above and branches below is eternal' (Ka. U., 6.1), and 'He who knows the tree with its roots above and branches below' (Tai. A., 1.11.5). It has its roots above since it has its roots in Brahma (the Creator otherwise known as Hiranyagarbha) who is seated above the seven worlds. It has 'branches below' ending with denizens like men, animals, beasts, worms, insects, birds and immovables. It is 'immutable' since it cannot be felled, being of the form of a continual flow. It can be felled only at the dawn of perfect knowledge which causes detachment. They say that the leaves of this Asvattha tree constitute the Vedas. 'The Vedas are said to be the leaves', since this tree of Samsara increases by actions prompted by worldly desires as taught in certain Srutis as, 'He who desires prosperity should sacrifice a white animal to Vayu' (Taitt. Sam., 2.1.1) and 'The desirer of offspring shall offer to Indra and Agni a sacrifice with eleven cups of rice-cakes' (Ibid., 2.2.1). Indeed the tree flourishes with the help of leaves. He who knows the Asvattha of such a nature 'knows the Vedas'. The Vedas also set forth the means of felling this tree of Samsara. He who understands this is called the knower of the Vedas, since knowledge of the nature of the tree to be cut off is helpful to the knowledge concerning the means of felling the tree.

This tree spreads downward with men etc., who are the products of their Karma, as branches. It again spreads above into Gandharvas, Yaksas, gods, etc. They are nourished by the Gunas of Sattva etc. They have tender shoots augmented by sense-objects.

How does this happen?  Sri Krsna explains:
15.1 See Comment under 15.2
15.1 Urdhva-mulam, that which has its roots upwards:- Brahman, possessed of the unmanifest power in the form of Maya, is referred to by the word 'upward' because of Its subtleness in point of time by virtue of Its being the Cause, and also because of Its eternality and vastness; and That is the root (mulam) of this world. The Tree of the World which is such, is urdhva-mulam. This accords with the Upanisadic text, 'This has its roots above and branches below' (Ka. 2.6.1). In the Purana also we have:
It sprouts from the Root in the form of the Unmanifest; it grows through the sturdiness of that very One. And it has abundance of intelligence as its trunk, and the appertures of the organs as the hollows.
The great elements are its boughs [A.G. takes the word visakha (boughs) in the sense of stambha, perhaps meaning the aerial roots.-Tr.]; so also, it has the objects of perception as its leaves. It has virtue and vice as its beautiful flowers, and happiness and sorrow are the fruits it bears.
This eternal Tree presided over by Brahman is a means of livelihood to all creatures. And this verily is the resort of Brahman [Or, etat brahma-vanam means: This Tree has Brahman as its object of adoration, its support. For, the world has nothing but Brahman as its support.] in it Brahman dwells for ever.
Having felled and split this Tree with the great sword of Knowledge, and then attaining the bliss of the Self, one does not return from that (bliss).' (Cf. Mbh. As. 47.12-15.)
That Tree which has its roots upwards and is constituted by the enchantment of mundane existence, and adhah-sakham, which has the branches downwards-mahat, [See under 7.4.-Tr.] egoism, subtle elements, etc. are its branches (sakhah), as it were, extending downwards (adhah); so, it has its branches downwards-; that Tree with its branches downwards, which does not (a) last (stha) even for the morrow (svah), is asvatthah (lit. Peepul tree). Ahuh, they say; that the asvatthah, Peepul Tree, undergoing destruction every moment; is avyayam, imperishable, and constituted by the enchantments of mundane existence. Having been in existence from time without beginning, that Tree of the World is imperishable. It is, indeed, will known as the sustainer of the beginningless and ceaseless series of bodies etc. They call that the imperishable.
Of that very Tree of the World here is another alification: Yasya, that Tree of the World of which; chandamsi-chandas being derived in the sense of covering (protecting)-, the Vedas in the form of Rk, Yajus and Sama; are the parnani, leaves, 
as it were. As leaves serve as protectors of a tree, so the Vedas serve as the protectors of the world; for they reveal what are virtue and vice as also their causes and results.
Yah, he who; veda, knows; tam, that-the Tree of the World along with its root, as has been explained; sah, he; is a vedavit, knower of the Vedas, i.e. versed in the meaning of the Vedas.
Since, apart from this Tree of the World along with its root, not even an iota of any other thing remains to be known, therefore he who knows the purport of the Vedas is omniscient. In this way the Lord euligizes the knowledge of the Tree together with its root.
An imagery of the other parts of that very Tree of the World is being presented:
15.10 The deluded do not see Him Who departs, stays and enjoys; but they who possess the eye of knowledge behold Him.
15.10 The ignorant do not see that it is He Who is present in life and Who departs at death or even that it is He Who enjoys pleasure through the Qualities. Only the eye of wisdom sees.
15.10. The deluded do not perceive;  [but] the men of knowledge-eye do see Him, as He dwells of rises up or enjoys what is endowed with Strands.
15.10 The deluded do not perceive It (i.e., the self) conjoined with the Gunas when departing or staying or experiencing. They who have the eye of knowledge see It.
15.10 Persons who are diversely deluded do not see it even when it is leaving or residing (in this body), or experiencing, or in association with the alities. Those with the eye of knowledge see.
15.10 The deluded do not perceive the Atman (self) as a form of knowledge separate from Its human and other configurations which are particular transformations of Prakrti, with which the self is conjoined when It is in embodied condition, experiencing the objects of the senses. The self also departs from the body when the body dies and assumes another body. The deluded or those who misconceive the body as the self do not understand all this. However, those who possess the eye of knowledge, i.e., have the knowledge concerning the difference between the body and the self, perceive the self as having a form different from the body in all conditions.
15.10 See Comment under 15.11
15.10 Thus, the embodied soul, utkarmantam, when it is leaving the body-the body that was assumed earlier; or sthitam, while residing in the (present) body; or bhunjanam, experiencing sound etc.; or guna-anvitam, in association with, i.e. identified with, the alities called happiness, sorrow and delusion-even when, under such conditions, this one comes very much within the range of cognition; vimudhah, the persons who are diversely deluded as a result of their hearts being forcibly attracted by the enjoyments of seen and unseen objects; na, do not; anu-pasyanti, see. And the Lord regrets this saying, 'Alas! How sorrowful this is!'
Those others, again, jnana-caksusah, who have the eye of knowledge, [Jnana-caksuh means the scriptures supported by reasoning, which are the means of knowledge.] who have the insight of under-standing which has arisen from the valid means of knowledge, i.e., those having a clear vision; pasyanti, see this one.
15.11 The Yogins striving (for perfection) behold Him dwelling in the Self; but, the unrefined and unintelligent, even though striving, see Him not.
15.11 The saints with great effort find Him within themselves; but not the unintelligent, who in spite of every effort cannot control their minds.
15.11. The exerting men of Yoga perceive Him dwelling in the Self. [But] the unintelligent men with their uncontrolled self do not perceive Him, even though they exert.
15.11 The striving Yogins see It established in themselves. But, though striving, those of unrefined minds, devoid of intelligence, perceive It not.
15.11 And the yogis who are diligent see this one as existing in themselves. The non-discriminating ones who lack self-control do not see this one-though (they be) diligent.
15.11 The 'striving Yogins' i.e., those striving in the path of Karma Yoga etc., after practising Prapatti (self-surrender), purify their inner organs of perception and percieve the self as established in Its own form as distinct from the body, with the eye of Yoga, But those of 'unrefined minds,' namely those who do not practise Prapatti to Me, and are therefore of 'uncultivated minds, and devoid of intelligence' find themselves incapable of perceiving the self. They do not perceive It in distinction from the body.

Thus, it has been said that the self, whether released or not, is a manifestation of the glory (Vibhuti) of the Lord, Its light of knowledge illuminates even the luminaries such as the sun, moon and fire which help the senses to see by removing the darkness that prevents the contact of the senses with their objects as described (in the verses):  'That supreme light ৷৷. is Mine' (15.6) and 'An everlasting part of Myself having become the (bound) self in the world of life' (15.7). Now, He declares that even the lights of the sun and other luminaries, which form particular developments of Prakrti, are Vibhutis of the Lord:
15.9-11 Srotram etc. upto asetasah.  Mind :  the internal organ is hery implied.  Hence, due to His association of  the bodily existence, when He remains  [in the body], or rises up to seize another body, or enjoys the sense objects - at that time the deluded persons do not perceive Him, because they are not well enlightened.  But, considering everything as manifestation of the  [Self] awareness, the highly enlightened men recognize Him.  Thus they are men of unbroken contemplation.  Because they are engrossed in their exertion.
 
But in the case of those who have not mastered their self (mind),  even their effort does not  yield any fruit, because their passion has not yet been fully decayed. Indeed the seeds of corn, sown during the autumnal season are not capable of yielding a rich harvest, even though the means like water etc., get collected together. Therefore, it (the water etc.) does not constitute a collection of means.  Indeed totally different is the water  sent forth by the mass of  clouds that had been filled up in the month of Madhu.  Altogether different is the earth that  had been under the grip of the Cold-season (Sisira)  and has (now) brilliance  by the simple touch of the sun-rays.  In the same way, the effort of the men of uncontrolled  self, never gets to the stage of fulfilment of all reisities .  That is why those  who, even after receiving the means like the inititation etc.  necessary for the realisation of the Supreme Lord, continue to have their inner vision filled with the collection of the knots (granthi) of anger, bewilderment etc., in the manner as before-in their case, even the means does never bear any fruit.  This must be borne in mind.  For, it is has been said :
 
'When anger etc., are seen, then even the initiated one never gets emancipation'.
15.11 And some, however, yoginah, the yogis of concentrated minds; yatantah, who are diligent; pasyanti, see; evam, this one, the Self under discussion; as avasthitam, existing; atmani, in themselves, in their own intelligence. They realize, 'I am This.'
Acetasah, the non-discriminating ones; akrta-atmanah, who lack self-control, who have not purified themselves through austerity and control of the organs, who have not desisted from bad conduct, who are not tranil and are proud by nature; na, do not; pasyanti, see; enam, this one; api, though; (they be) yatantah, diligent-even though they be striving with the help of the valid means of knowledge such as the scriptures.
With a view to speaking of the all-pervasiveness of the State and the fact of Its being the substratum of all empirical dealings, the Lord speaks in brief through the following four verses of the divine manifestations of that State which the light of fire, sun, etc. do not illumine though they are the illuminators of everything; and reaching which the aspirants of Liberation do not return again towards mundane existence; and of which State the individual souls, owing to their conformity with the diversity of limiting adjuncts, are parts, just as spaces enclosed in pot etc. are 'parts' of Space:
15.12 That light which residing in the sun illumines the whole world, that which is in the moon and in the fire  know that light to be Mine.
15.12 Remember that the Light which, proceeding from the sun, illumines the whole world, and the Light which is in the moon, and That which is in the fire also, all are born of Me.
15.12. That light which is found in the sun, which is in the moon, and which is [also] in the fire-all illuminating the entire world-know that light to be of  Mine.
15.12 That brilliance in the sun which illumines the whole universe, that in the moon and that in fire, know that brilliance as Mine.
15.12 That light in the sun which illumines the whole world, that which is in the moon, and that which is in fire,-know that light to be Mine.
15.12 That brilliance of the sun and other luminaries which illumines the whole universe - that brilliance belongs to Me. Know that this capacity of illumining is granted to them by Me who have been worshipped severally by them.

Sri Krsna states that the power in the earth to support all those that reside on it belongs to Him alone:
15.12 See Comment under 15.14
15.12 Yat, that which is; aditya-gatam, in the sun, which abides in the sun;-what is that-the tejah, light, brilliance, radiance; which bhasayate, illumines, reveals; akhilam, the whole, entire; jagat, world; yat, that ulluminating light which is; candramasi, in the moon; ca, and yat, which is; agnau, in fire, the carrier of oblations; viddhi, know; tat, that; tejah, light; to be mamakam, Mine. That light belong to Me who am Visnu.
Or: The light that is Consciousness, which is in the sun, which is in the moon, and which is in fire, know that light to be Mine. That light belongs to Me who am Visnu.
Objection; Is it not that the light that is Consciousness exists eally in the moving and the non-moving? Such being the case, why is this particular mention, 'That light in the sun which৷৷.,'etc?
Reply: This defect does not arise, because, owing to the abundance of the sattva ality, there can be an abundane [Ast. reads avistaratva (amplitude) in place of adhikya.-Tr.] (of Consciousness). Since in the sun etc. the sattva is very much in evidence, is greatly brilliant, therefore there is an abundance of the light (of Consciousness) in them alone. And so it (sun etc.) is specially mentioned. But it is not that it (Consciousness) is abundant only there. Indeed, as in the world, a face, though in the same position, is not reflected in wood, a wall, etc., but in a mirror etc. it is reflected according to the degree in which they are more and more transparent, so is it here.
Further,
15.13 Permeating the earth I support all beings by (My) energy; and having become the watery moon I nourish all herbs.
15.13 1	enter this world and animate all My creatures with My vitality; and by My cool moonbeams I nourish the plants.
15.13. And penetrating the earth I support [all] beings with [My] energy; being the sapful moon, I nourish all plants.
15.13 And entering the earth I uphold all beings by My strength. I nourish all herbs, becoming the juicy Soma.
15.13 And entering the earth I sustain the beings through (My) power; and nourish all the plants by becoming Soma [According to S. and most other translators, Soma means the moon.-Tr.] which is of the nature of sap.
15.13 Entering the earth I uphold all beings by My strength, namely, by My irresistible power, Likewise, becoming the Soma consisting of the juice of the nectar, I nourish all herbs.
15.13 See Comment under 15.14
15.13 Ca, and; avisya, entering; gam, the earth; aham, I; dharayami, sustain; bhutani, the beings, the world; ojasa, through (My) power, the power that belongs to God and is free from passing and attachment, (and) which has penetrated the earth to support it, and owing to which the heavy earth does not fall and does not crumble. There is a similar mantra:
'By which the heaven is made mighty, and the earth firm' (Tai. Sam. 4.1.8.5), and also,
'He supported the earth' (op.cit., 4.1.8.3), etc.
Hence, it has rightly been said, 'Entering the earth I sustain the moving and non-moving beings.'
Moreover, pusnami, I nourish, I make healthy and full of the sweet flavour of juices; sarvah, all; osadhih, the plants-paddy, barley, etc.; bhutva, by becoming; somah, Soma; rasatmakah, which is of the nature of sap. Soma consists of all the juices; it is the source of all juices. Indeed, it nourishes all plants by infusing its own juice into everything.
Besides,
15.14 Having become the fire Vaisvanara, I abide in the body of living beings and, associated with the Prana and the Apana, digest the fourfold food.
15.14 Becoming the fire of life, I pass into their bodies and, uniting with the vital streams of Prana and Apana, I digest the various kinds of food.
15.14. Being the digestive fire dwelling within the body of living creatures, and being in association with the upward and downward winds [of the body],  I digest the four kinds of  food.
15.14 Becoming the digestive fire, I function within the bodies of all living beings. In union with inward and outward breath, I digest the four kinds of food.
15.14 Taking the form of Vaisvanara and residing in the bodies of creatures, I, in association with Prana and Apana, digest the four kinds of food.
15.14 Becoming the 'digestive fire', or the fire of digestion, I function within the bodies of all living creatures. In union with various activities of 'inward and outward breaths', I digest the 'four kinds of food' eaten by individuals. These consist of foods to be chewed, sucked, licked and drunk.

The Supreme Person who has the Soma, digestive fire etc., as his glory (Vibhuti) is here eated with Him by means of co-ordinate predication in the verses 'Becoming the juicy Soma' and 'Becoming the digestive fire'. He now sets forth the reason for eating these glories with Himself.
15.12-14 Yad aditya-etc. upto caturvidham.  While clarifying the role [of the Lord] as the Creator, Sustainer and Destroyer - a  role that has been indicated in the Tenth Chapter - by [the  description of Him as identical with] the triple luminories like the sun etc., our venerable preceptor has rightly said : The present  passage declares  that the power, the pentad of elements has [both] collectively and individually, to sustain the world, is the Absolute power of the Bhagavat Himself.  For instance : The sunlight has the power of  illumining and sustaining, because the twin elements of the fire and the earth are one [with the Bhagavat].  This has been started by the twin hemistitches  '[That light] which is found in the sun etc.' and  'And by penetrating the earth etc.'  The moon-light is illumining and  nourishing  because of its assoication  of the elements of the earth, the water and the fire [with the Bhagavat].  That has been stated by the portion '[That light]  which is in the moon' and by the hemistitch  'Being the sapful moon I nourish all plants'.  The light of fire is,  however, of the nature of illumining, parching, burning, sweating and ripening (or cooking).  It is so because of the association of the elements, the earth, the water, the fire and the wind  [with the Bhagavat].  The same has been said here by the portion,  '[That light] which is in the fire'  and also by the [entire verse]  'I, being the digestive  fire etc.' But the  [element]  ether is no doubt all pervaisve (inclusive), because it is of the form of room which is nothing but awareness.								
 Therefore, having so far explained the nature [of the Absolute Self] as the object of knowledge, now, with a view to show the Self to be conscious of the freedom that remains as a background  (or substratum) of that very nature of object of knowledge;  to be of transcending nature; to be the Supreme Lord; to be independent in all knowledges; and to be the Creator of all; [the Lord]  says -
15.14 Bhutva, taking the form of; vaisvanarah, Vaisvanara, the fire in the stomach, mentioned in such Upanisadic texts as, 'This fire that is within man and digests the food (that is eaten) is Vaisvanara' (Br. 5.9.1); becoming that Vaisvanara, and asritah, residing in, entering; deham, the bodies; praninam, of creatures, of living beings; aham, I Myself; prana-apana-samayuktah, in association [i.e. kindled, inflamed, by Prana and Apana.] with Prana and Apana; [Prana-that vital force which goes upward and has its seat really in the heart (cf. Tai. Br. 3.10.8.5), but it said to be located at the tip of the nose since its presence is directly felt there.
Apana-that vital force which goes downward, below the navel, and has its seat in the organs of excertion.-Tr.] pacami, digest; the caturvidham, four kinds of; annam, food-those that are eaten by masticating, swallowing, sucking and licking.
The eater is the fire called Vaisvanara, and the eaten is the food Soma. One who looks upon all that there is as being these two, fire and Soma, is not affected by the impurity of food.
Further,
15.15 And I am seated in the hearts of all; from Me are memory and knowledge, as well as their absence. I am verily That which has to be known by all the Vedas; I am indeed the author of the Vedanta and the knower of the Vedas am I.
15.15 I am enthroned in the hearts of all; memory, wisdom and discrimination owe their origins to Me. I am He Who is to be realised in the scriptures; I inspire their wisdom and I know their truth.
15.15. I am entered (the Self-conciousness is felt) in the heart of all; from Me (this Self-consciousness) come the faculty of memory, the faculty of  knowing, and also the faculty of differentiating; none but Me is to be known by means of all the Vedas and I am alone the author of the final part of the Vedas and also the author of the Vedas themselves.
15.15 And I am seated in the hearts of all. From Me are memory, knowledge and their removal also. Indeed I alone am to be known from all the Vedas. I bring about the fruition of the rituals of Vedas; I alone am the knower of the Vedas.
15.15 And I am seated in the hearts of all. From Me are memory, knowledge and their loss. I alone am the object to be known through all the Vedas; I am also the originator of the Vedanta, and I Myself am the knower of the Vedas.
15.15 Controlling everything by My will, I exist as 'the self in their hearts', namely, in the place from which springs knowledge, the root of activity and inactivity of all beings as also of the Soma and digestive fire. So the Srutis declare in the following texts:  'Entering within, He is the ruler of all things and the Self of all' (Tai. A., 3.11), 'He who, dwelling in the earth ৷৷. He who, dwelling in the self, is within the self ৷৷. who controls the earth' (Br. U. Madh., 3.7. 3. 22); 'The heart which is comparable to an inverted lotus-bud' (Ma. Na., 11.7); and 'Now, here, in the city of brahman, is an abode, a small lotus-flower' (Cha. U., 8.1.1). The Smrtis also declare thus:  'Visnu is the ruler of the whole universe, who permeates the universe' (V. P., 1.17. 20), 'He is the ruler of all, who is minutely small among those who are minutely small (Manu., 12.122); and 'He is the controller, the judge, the King, who is seated in your heart' (Ibid., 8.92).

Therefore, the memory of all beings springs from Me alone. 'Memory' is knowledge springing from experience and its subtle impressions. They have for their contents past experiences. 'Knowledge' is determination of a thing through the senses, inference, the scriptures and intuitive meditation. This is also from Me. So does 'Apohana' too. 'Apohana' signifies the cessation of knowledge. 'Apohana' may also mean 'Uhana' (conjectural knowledge). Uhana is 'Uha' (conjecture). 'Uha' is that knowledge which is accessory to the actual means of knowledge (Pramana). It is done by determining whether that means of knowledge can be operative with reference to the particular subject-matter on hand, through the examination of the instruments of that means of knowledge (Pramana). This 'Uha' also comes from Me.

Indeed 'I am to be known from all the Vedas,' for I am the inner ruler of Agni, Surya, Soma, Vayu, Sun and Indra and other divinities as their self. The Vedas are intent on speaking of them (i.e., the divinities). 'I am to be known from all the Vedas; for, terms like gods, men etc., signify the individual selves in them. I bring about the fruition of the Veda. 'Vedanta', here means the end, namely, the fruition, of Vedic injunctions like 'Let sacrifice be made to Indra' and 'Let sacrifice be made to Varuna.' For, all Vedas find their consummation in fruition. 'Antakrt' means grantor of fruits. The meaning is:  'I alone am the grantor of the fruition described in the Vedas.' This has been already declared in the verses beginning from, 'Whichever devotee seeks to worship with faith whatever form' and ending with, 'From that faith he gets the objects of his desire, granted in reality by Me alone' (7.21 - 22); and also 'I am the enjoyer and the only Lord of all sacrifices' (9.24). I am the knower of the Vedas; I know the Veda that speaks about Me. The sense is that he who speaks of the meaning of the Vedas as otherwise than this import, is not the knower of the Vedas.

Therefore, listen from Me alone the meaning or the essene of the Vedas.
15.15 Sarvasya etc.  The heart  (core) of all obejcts is the Awareness which has the freedom of drawing in all [beings within itself]  In it exists  [as identical with it] the  I-consciousness.  From  This are born  (1)  the faculty  knowing, which is illumining anything new - a faculty which is (hence) in the form the mighty creation of the  universe;  (2)  he faculty of differentiating, like fancying  'This is nothing but a pot', which fancying is in essence a sort of limiting Its status of being everything; which is suitable for the perceiver, full-of-Illusion  in the form of creating a bonded Soul; and  (3) also the faculty of remembrance which is the faculty of reilluminating what has been reduced ot mental impression and has been  [thus]  with-drawn.  These [three] are inclusive of all  [sorts of]  knowledge.  Thus [the Lord's primary]  doership, which is nothing but the sovereignty of will and which presupposes His ominscience, has been taught [in this verse here].
 
By means of all [the Vedas]  etc. :  Indeed nothing, but the  Supreme Lord is to be explained and proved by all the scriptures.  [The description of the Lord]  as the author of the Vedas and the ends of the Vedas  (Upanisads)  amounts to say this :- The Bhagavat alone has got the sovereign freedom in creating the entire universe, through the medium for the actions, their results, their  [mutual] connections etc.,  and in re-establishing  it on His (or its)  own nature after rooting it out.  Thus the Lord's creatorship with regard to the universe is explained.
 
Others say :  The word apohanam denotes the faculty of excluding  (viz),  'This results from this non-performance.'  [Again Vedantakrt]  means : 'He effects the final part of the Vedas'  i.e৷৷ by absorbing them into Himself.  Similarly  [with]  'the Vedas' too.
15.15 And aham, I, as the Self; san-nivistah, am seated; hrdi, in the hearts, in the intellects; sarvasya, of all creatures. Therefore, with regard to all the creatures, mattah, from Me, from the Self; are Smrtih, memory; jnanam, knowledge; and their apohanam, loss.
The knowledge and memory of these creatures who perform good deeds come from Me in accordance with the good deeds; similarly, the loss, deterioration, of memory and knowledge of those who perform evil deeds comes from Me in accordance with the evil deeds.
Aham eva, I alone, the supreme Self; am the vedyah, object to be known; sarvaih, through all; vedaih, the Vedas. I am also the vedanta-krt, the originator of the Vedanta, i.e., the source of the traditional school of the teachings of Vedanta; and aham eva, I Myself; am the veda-vit, knower of the Vedas, the knower of the teachings of the Vedas.
In the verses beginning with, 'That light in the sun which৷৷.' (12), etc. have been stated briefly the majesty of God, the Lord called Naravana, which arise from special limiting adjuncts. Now then, the succeeding verses are begun with a view to determining the real nature of that very Lord as the Unconditioned and Absolute, by distinguishing Him from the limiting adjuncts, (viz) the mutable and the immutable. In that connection, after dividing into three parts [The two limiting adjuncts-the mutable and the immutable-, and the supreme Self.] all the teachings of the preceding and the immediately succeeding chapters, the Lord says:
15.16 Two Purushas there are in this world, the perishable and the imperishable. All beings are 
the perishable and the Kutastha  the unchanging  is called the imperishable.
15.16 There are two aspects in Nature: the perishable and the imperishable. All life in this world belongs to the former, the unchanging element belongs to the latter.
15.16. There are two persons in the world, the perishing and the nonperishing : the perishing is all elements  [and]  the speak-like One is called the nonperishing.
15.16 There are two kinds of Persons (Purusas) spoken of in the Sastra - the perishable (Ksara) and the imperishable (Aksara). The perishable is all beings and the imperishable is called the unchanging (Kutastha).
15.16 There are these two persons in the world-the mutable and the immutable. The mutable consists of all things; the one existing as Maya is called the immutable.
15.16 There are, the Sastras say, 'two kinds of Persons (Purusas)' well known in the world - 'the perishable and the imperishable.' Of the two, the Persons designated by the term 'perishable' (Ksara) are beings conjoint with non-conscient matter of modifiable nature, from Brahma down to a blade of grass,who can be signified also by the term Jivas (individual selves). Here the term Purusa (Person) is used in singular to indicate the common single condition of being conjoined with non-conscient matter. That which is the 'imperishable' (Aksara) is called 'unchanging' (Kutastha), this is the released self, devoid of association with non-conscient matter, remaining in its own form. It is called 'unchangeable' inasmuch as when free from non-conscient matter, It has no specific connection with particular transformations of non-conscient matter like the bodies of Brahma etc. Here also the designation of the term in singular (as expressing a generic class) denoting the totality of liberated selves, is used on account of the single condition of dissociation from non-conscient matter. It does not mean that before this, in time without beginning, there existed but a single liberated self. So it is stated:  'Purified by the austerity of knowledge, many have attained My state' (4.10); and 'They are not born at the time of creation, nor do they suffer at the time of dissolution' (14.2).

15.16 There are imau, these; dvau, two-grouped separately; purusau, persons, so called [Persons-so called only figuratively, since they are the limiting adjuncts of the supreme Person.]; loke in the world; the ksarah, mutable-one group consists of the perishable; the other person is the aksarah, immutable, opposite of the former, the power of God called Maya, which is the seed of the origin of the person called the mutable. That which is the receptacle of the impressions of desires, actions, etc. of countless transmigrating creatures is called the immutable person.
Who are those persons? The Lord Himself gives the answer: Ksarah, the mutable; consists of sarvani, all; bhutani, things, i.e. the totality of all mutable things. Kutasthah is the one existing as Maya: Kuta means a heap; kutasthah, is that which exists like a heap. Or, kuta is maya, deception, falsehood, crookedness, which are synonymous; that which exists in the diverse forms of maya etc. is the kutasthah. It is ucyate, called; the aksarah, immutable, because, owing to the countless seeds of worldly existence, it does not perish.
15.17 But distinct is the Supreme Purusha called the highest Self, the indestructible Lord Who, pervading the three worlds, sustains them.
15.17 But higher than all am I, the Supreme God, the Absolute Self, the Eternal Lord, Who pervades the worlds and upholds them all.
15.17. But the Highest Person, distinct [from both this] is spoken of as the Supreme Self, which, being the changeless Lord, sustains the triad of the world by entering into it.
15.17 There is the Supreme Person other than these. He is named the Supreme Self (Paramatma) in all the Vedas. He who, as the Immutable One and the Lord, entering the threefold world, supports it.
15.17 But different is th supreme Person who is spoken of as the transcendental Self, who, permeating the three worlds, upholds (them), and is the imperisahble God.
15.17 But there is the 'Supreme Person who is other than the bound and liberated selves' expressed by the terms, the 'perishable' and the 'imperishable'. He forms a completely different category. All Srutis call Him the Supreme Self. But by that very designation as the Supreme Self, it may be known that the Supreme Person is a category distinct from the bound and the liberated selves. How?  'Entering the threefold world,' supports it. 'Loka' (world) is that which is perceived. There are three such perceivable worlds, He enters the 'three worlds' which can be understood from the authority of the Srutis. These are the world of unconscient matter, the world of conscient selves conjoined with matter, and the world of liberated selves. As understandable from the Srutis, He enters into these three categories as their Atman and supports them. Thus, He is an entity different from the triad which He pervades and maintains. Further He is different, as He is imperishable and as He is the Lord. Being imperishable, He is different from the bound non-conscient matter whose nature is subject to decay. He is different from the bound conscient selves as the latter is subject to Prakrti and follows its laws. He is also distinguished from the liberated selves, because in their previous condition they were connected with matter and mixed with it. Similarly, He is the Lord of these 'three worlds,' a category distinct from those which have to be ruled.
15.17 See Comment under 15.18
15.17 Tu, but; anyah, different, entirely contrary in characteristics from these; is the uttamah, supreme, most excellent; purusah, Person, who is different in characteristics from these-the mutable and the immutable-, untouched by the mutable and the immutable limiting adjuncts, and is by nature eternal, pure, conscious and free; udahrtah, spoken of in the Upanisads; iti, as; the paramatma, supreme Self; He is paramah, supreme, as compared with the selves like body etc. created by ignorance, and is the atma, Self, the inmost Consciousness of all beings. Hence He is the supreme Self. He Himself is being specially described: yah, who, by dint of His own active power inhering in the energy that is Maya; [Caitanya, consciousness, itself is the bala (energy); the sakti (active power) therein is Maya. Through that He upholds.] avisya, permeating; loka-trayam, the three worlds-called Bhuh (Earth), Bhuvah, (Intermediate Space) and Svah (Heaven); bibharti, upholds (them) by merely being present in His own nature. (And He) is the avyayah, imperishable; isvarah, God, the Omniscient One called Narayana, who is the Lord by nature.
This name-the supreme Person-of God as described is well known. Showing that the name is apt by virtue of its etymological significance, the Lord reveals Himself saying, 'I am the unsurpassable God':
15.18 As I transcend the perishable and am even higher than the imperishable, I am declared to be the highest Purusha in the world and in the Vedas.
15.18 Beyond comparison of the Eternal with the non-eternal am I, Who am called by scriptures and sages the Supreme Personality, the Highest God.
15.18. Becuase, I have transcended the perishing and also the nonperishing, therefore I am acclaimed in the world as well as in the Veda as the Highest of persons.
15.18 Because I transcend the perishable Person and am also higher than the imperishable person, therefore I am styled in the Smrti and the Veda as the Supreme Person (Purusotama).
15.18 Since I am transcendental to the mutable and above even the immutable, hence I am well known in the world and in the Vedas as the supreme Person.
15.18 Inasmuch as I transcend the perishable (i.e., bound) Person of the aforesaid nature, and I am higher, for reasons stated earlier, than the imperishable Person or liberated self, therefore I am styled the Supreme Person in the Smrti and Srutis. The Smrti is called Loka by reason of its leading to the meaning of the Vedas. The meaning is that I am famous in the Srutis and in the Smrti. In the Sruti for instance; 'Reaching the Supreme Light, it appears in its own nature. He is the Supreme Person' (Cha. U., 8.12.3). In the Smrti we have texts like 'I will approach Him (Sri Krsna), the Supreme Person who is the incarnation of a portion of Visnu, who is without beginning, middle or end' (V. P., 5.17.33).
15.16-18 Dvav imau etc. upto Purusottamah.  What has been stated in the passage  'There are two persons in the world etc.', is this :  The body organism is made of the earth and other elements.  In the world every person, unitelligent by nature, takes the body for the Self and [hence]  views the Soul to be of perishing nature.  Hence, the sense of duality does not come to an end with regard to the worldly persons, because of  their delusion.  But I am (the I-consciousness is)  the One favouring all, and by cutting the daulity-knot I am to be realised as the One pervading all.
 
(I) have transcended the perishing :   Since the elements are insentient.  (I)  have transcended the nonperishing :  Since the omnipresence  [of the Self] is cut off (not comprehended) when the Self is not properly realised.  In the world and in the Veda too I am acclaimed as the Highest of  Persons :  The Self same Supreme Self, admitting no duality, is described in this manner with the sentences  'He is he Highest Person'  and the like.
15.18 Yasmat, since; aham, I; am atitah, transcendental; ksaram, to the mutable-I am beyond the Tree of Maya, called the Peepul Tree, which this worldly existence is; and uttamah, above, most excellent or the highest; as compared with api, even; the akasarat, immutable, which is the seed of the Tree of worldly existence; atah, hence, by virtue of being the most excellent as compared with the mutable and the immutable; aham, I; am prathitah, well known; loke, in the world; and vede, in the Vedas; as purusottamah, the supreme Person. Devoted persons know Me thus, and poets also use this name 'Purusottama' in their poetry etc.; they extol Me with this name.
Thereafter, now is stated this result attained by one who knows the Self as described:
15.19 He who, undeluded, knows Me thus as the highest Purusha, he, knowing all, worships Me with his whole being (heart), O Arjuna.
15.19 He who with unclouded vision sees Me as the Lord-God, knows all there is to be known, and always shall worship Me with his whole heart.
15.19. He, who, being not deluded, thus  knows Me as the Highest of persons - he knows all and serves Me with his entire being, O descendant of Bharata !
15.19 He who, without delusion thus knows Me as the Supreme Self, knows all, O Arjuna, and worships Me in every way.
15.19 O scion of the Bharata dynasty, he who, being free from delusion, knows Me the supreme Person thus, he is all-knowing and adores Me with his whole being.
15.19 He who, without delusion, knows the Supreme Person as Myself, as already stated, i.e., knows Me, as differing in kind from the perishable and the imperishable Persons, because of My being immutable and because of My being distinguished from them as pervading, supporting and ruling etc., by nature - such a devotee knows all. He knows all that is to be known as the means of attaining Me. He worships Me in 'every way,' i.e., whatever ways of worshipping Me have been prescribed as the means of attaining Me, he worships Me by all these modes of worship. Whatever love is evoked in Me towards one approaching Me by all forms of knowledge having Me for their object, and whatever love is roused up in Me towards those who practise various modes of worship having Me for their object - all that in a unified form is generatd in Me towards one who has the knowledge of Me as described.

Now, Sri Krsna eulogises this knowledge of the Supreme Person:
15.19 Yo mam etc.  He, who knows Me thus i.e., he who meditates  exclusively on Me as identical with all, and to be the very Brahman - he realises all to be identical with Me and adores (or experiences) Me alone with his entire being viz., his form, action and thought.  [That is to say], whatever he perceives, he experiences it as the form of the Bhagavat ; and so on.  Hence [it has been said]  by myself  (Ag.) in the Sivasaktyavinabhavastotra as :
 
O Mother (Goddess) ! Our praise to You is unusual one ;  all (uttering)   sounds constitute Your body indeed; in my entire body and in all [my] mental and external activities there is Your association.
 
O Siva, O Alleviator of what is inauspicious !  When I fully contemplate in this manner, then it has been accomplished in the world, without any effort  [of mine],  that for me there is indeed not even a small fraction of time without praise, recitation  [of hymns], worship and contemplation [of Yours].
15.19 Bharata, O scion of the Bharata dynasty; yah, he who; asammudhah, being free from delusion; janati, knows; mam, Me, God, having the aforesaid alifications; purusottamam, the supreme Person; evam, thus, in the way described, as 'I am this One'; sah, he; is sarva-vit, all-knowing- he knows everything through self-identification with all-, i.e. (he becomes) omniscient; and bhajati, adores; mam, Me, existing in all things; sarva-bhavena, with his whole being, i.e. with his mind fixed on Me as the Self of all.
Now then, having stated in this chapter the knowledge of the real nature of the Lord, which has Liberation as its fruit, it is being euligized:
15.2 Below and above spread its branches, nourished by the Gunas; sense-objects are its buds; and below, in the world of men, stretch forth the roots, originating action.
15.2 Its branches shoot upwards and downwards, deriving their nourishment from the Qualities; its buds are the objects of sense; and its roots, which follow the Law causing man's regeneration and degeneration, pierce downwards into the soil.
15.2. Of which (Tree) the branches, spreading downward and upward, well developed with Strands, have sense objects as sprouts; also below in the human world are Its roots, stretching successively, having actions for their sub-knots.
15.2 (a) Its branches extend both above and below, nourished by the Gunas. Their shoots are sense objects ৷৷.

 (b) ৷৷. And their secondary roots extend downwards, resulting in acts which bind in the world of men.
15.2 The branches of that (Tree), extending down-wards and upwards, are strengthened by the alities and have sense-objects as their shoots. And the roots, which are followed by actions, spread down-wards in the human world [According to A.G. and M.S. manusya-loke means a body distinguished by Brahminhood etc.].
15.2 The 'secondary roots' of this tree having the main roots in the world of Brahman and its crest in men ramify below in the world of men. They bind them according to their Karma. The meaning is that the effects of acts causing bondag become roots in the world of men. For, the effect of actions done in the human state brings about the further condition of men, beasts etc., down below, and of divinities etc., up above.
15.1-2 Urdhva-mulam etc.  Adhas ca etc. In other scriptural texts it is delcared  'All is the holy Fig-tree; that alone is to be meditated upon'.  The present verse tells us this :  What is intended by that declaration is only the religious meditation of the Brahman, the Bhagavat.  Root :  the one with a highly tranil nature.  That is high (above) :  Becasue it can be attained by him alone who has withdrawn himself from every other [lower] thing.  The [Vedic] hymns are the leaves  [of it] etc. :  Just as the girth, height, the fruits and the taste etc. of a tree are indicated by its leaves, in  the same fashion the idea of the Brahman-being is through the scriptures that are included in the 'Vedic hymns'.  This is what is narrated here.  With Strands :  i.e., with the Sattva etc.  Well developed : i.e., starting from gods down to the stationary ones.  Of this tree, the roots, that are below, are the good and bad actions.
15.2 Sakhah, the branches, as it were; tasya, of that Tree; prasrtah, extending; adhah, downwards, from the human beings to the immobile (trees etc.); ca, and; urdhvam, upwards, upto Brahma-beginning from the Creator of the Cusmos to Dharma (Death) [According to A.G. 'human beings' stands for the world of human beings, and 'Brahma ' for the 'world of Brahma' (Satva-loka). So Dharma may mean the 'world of Death' (pitr-loka).-Tr.], which, 'in accordance with their work and in conformity with their knowledge' (Ka. 2.2.7), are the results of knowledge and actions; are guna-pravrddhah, strengthened, made stout, by the alities sattva, rajas and tamas, which are their materials; and visaya-pravalah, have the sense-objects as their shoots. The sense-objects (sound etc.) sprout, as it were, like new leaves from the branches (bodies etc.) which are the results of actions. Thery the branches are said to have sense-objects as their shoots.
The supreme Root, the material cause of the Tree of the World, has been stated earlier. And now, the latent impressions of attraction, repulsion, etc. born of the results of action are the subsidiary roots, as it were, which grow later on and become the cause of involvement in righteousness and and unrighteousness. And those mulani, roots; karma-anubandhini, which are followed by actions; anu-santatani, spread, enter; adhah, downwards, as compared with the world of gods; manusya-loke, into the world of human beings particularly-for it is well known that (only) here men have competence for rites and duties. They (these roots) are said to be karma-anubandhini since actions (karma) that are characterized as righteous and unrighteous follow as their product (anubandha), (i.e.) succeed the rise of those (attraction, repulsion, etc.).
15.20 Thus, this most secret science has been taught by Me, O sinless one; on knowing this, a man becomes wise, and all his duties are accomplished, O Arjuna.
15.20 Thus, O Sinless One, I have revealed to thee this most mystic knowledge. He who understands gains wisdom and attains the consummation of life."
15.20. Thus the most secret scripture has been taught by Me, O sinless one;  by understanding this, let a man become wise and also become one who has accomplished what reires to be accomplished, O descendant of Bharata !
15.20 Thus, O sinless one, has this most mysterious doctrine been imparted by Me. By understanding this, a man will become truly wise and will have fulfilled his duty.
15.20 O sinless one, this most secret scripture has thus been uttered by Me. Understanding this, one becomes wise and has his duties fulfilled, O scion of the Bharata dynasty.
15.20 Thus, this Sastra, the most mysterious of all mysteries and which teaches My aspect as the Supreme Person, has been imparted to you by Me, as you are worthy to receive it because you are sinless. By understanding this, a man will become truly wise and will have fulfilled his duty. Whatever wisdom has to be cultivated for attaining Me, all that should be taken as cultivated and that whatever duty has to be fulfilled in that connection - all that is to be taken as fulfilled by knowing this (the Purusottama Vidya). He gets all spiritual fulfilment by this knowledge, except the direct vision of Purusottama. [Probably the idea is that direct vision comes only when the body falls at the end of the antum of Karma that has brought it into existence. Before that only the state of the Sthitaprajna can be attained. The thin veil of residual Karma still stands in the way.]
15.20  Iti  etc.  The most secret [scripture] : Because it explains  the oneness of all.  One becomes a man of wisdom by knowing this only and not by the knowledge of worldly affairs. One becomes a man of success by just understanding this, and not even by the deeds like the total victory over the foes, earning  wealth, enjoying women and so on.  The word ca  'also'  indicates a wonder.  Has it not been witnessed that  [always] one becomes a man of  success by what has been accomplished ?  But it is strange that [in the present case one becomes a man of success] by just what has been realised.
 
The word iti  'thus'  indicates the conclusion of the treatise.  For, what is to be taught has come to an end completely.  That is why in the Sixteenth Chapter the eligibility of the pupil, Arjuna, is exclusively dealt with; and nothing new is taught.  The intention  [of that chapter] is to say only this much :  'The divine wealth is just of that nature;  but the devilish wealth born of illusion is of this nature; you (Arjuna) are however endowed with the divine wealth of wisdom'.  Hence [the Lord] is going to say  'Don't  worry.  [You are endowed] with the divine wealth'  (XVI, 5).  That is why earlier in the context of explaining the clash between the wisdom and ignorance this has been indicated [by me (Ag.)]:  'It is the confrontation between the wisdom and ignorance that has been detailed under the pretext of [describing] the wars between the  gods and devils.'  So, while dealing essentially with the ality of a pupil, other subjects are mentioned incidentally.  So also the pair of chapters (Ch. XVII &  XVIII) would follow.  But the teaching [proper] has come to an end completely here itself.  For what is to be achieved is nothing but serving (attaining) the Absolute Lord-the serving, which is of the nature of total  absorption into Him by one's entire being.  All other things are only to achieve this end.  This has been explained earlier.  The Supreme Happiness is indeed nothing but a complete absorption into the Supreme Lord by one's entire being.
15.20 This guhyatamam, most secret, i.e. most mystical;- what is that?-sastram, scripture-. Although the Gita as a whole is spoken of as the scripture, still this chapter itself is here referred to as such, and this for eulogy as is evident from the context. For, not only has the entire meaning of the scripture Gita been stated here in brief, but the whole purport of the Vedas also has been comprehended here. And it has been said, 'He who realizes it is a knower of the Vedas' (1), 'I alone am the object to be known through all the Vedas' (15). (Thus, this most secret scripture) iti uktam, has thus been uttered; maya, by Me; anagha, O sinless one.
O scion of the Bharata dynasty, buddhva, under-standing; etat, this, the scripture which has the purport as has been revealed; syat, one becomes; buddhiman, wise; and krta-krtyah, has his duties fulfilled; but not otherwise. The meaning is that what-ever a Brahmana has to do as a conseence of his special birth (as a Brahmana), all that becomes accomplished when the reality of the Lord is known. The idea is that nobody's duties become fulfilled in any other way. And it has been said, 'O son of Prtha, all actions in their totality culminate in Knowledge' (4.33). There is also a saying from Manu:
'This, verily, is the fulfilment of a Brahmana in particular. For, by getting this, a twice-born has his duties fulfilled; not otherwise' (Ma. Sm. 12.93).
Since you have heard from Me this truth about the supreme Reality, therefore, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, you have achieved your Goal!
15.3 Its form is not perceived here as such, neither its end nor its origin, nor its foundation nor resting place: having cut asunder this firmly rooted peepul tree with the strong axe of non-attachment.
15.3 In this world its true form is not known, neither its origin nor its end, and its strength is not understood., until the tree with its roots striking deep into the earth is hewn down by the sharp axe of non-attachment.
15.3. The nature of this is not perceived in that manner, nor its end, nor its beginning and nor its centre (the middle).  Cutting this holy Fig-tree-with its firmly and variedly grown roots-by means of the sharp (or strong) exe of non-attachment;
15.3 Its form as such is not perceived here, nor its end, nor its beginning, nor its support. Having cut off this firm-rooted Asvattha with the strong axe of detachment৷৷.
15.3 Its form is not perceived here in that way; nor its end, nor beginning, nor continuance, After felling this Peepul whose roots are well developed, with the strong sword of detachment-;
15.3 - 15.4 The form of this tree, having its origin above, i.e., in the four-faced Brahma and branches below in the sense that man forms the crest through continual lineage therefrom, and also having its branches extended above and below by actions done in the human state and forming secondary roots - that form of the tree is not understood by people immersed in Samsara. Only this much is perceived:  'I am a man, the son of Devadatta, the father of Yajnadatta; I have property appropriate to these conditions'. Likewise, it is not understood that its destruction can be brought about by detachment from enjoyments which are based on Gunas. Similarly it is not perceived that attachment to the Gunas alone is the beginning of this (tree). Again, it is not perceived that the basis of this tree is founded on ignorance which is the misconception of self as non-self. Ignorance alone is the basis of this tree, since in it alone the tree is fixed. 

This Asvattha, described above, firm-rooted, i.e., the roots of which are firm and manifold, is to be cut off by the strong axe of detachment, namely, detachment from the sense objects composed of the three Gunas. This can be forged through perfect knowledge. As one gains detachment from sense-objects, one should seek and find out the goal from which nobody ever returns.

How does this attachment to sense-objects, which consists of the Gunas and erroneous knowledge forming its cause, cease to exist?

Sri Krsna now answers:

One should seek 'refuge (Prapadyet) in the Primal Person' alone in order to overcome this ignorance. One should seek refuge (Prapadyeta) in Him who is primal, namely, the beginning of all entities, as stated in the following text:  'With Me as the Lord, the Prakrti gives birth to all that which moves, and that which does not move' (9.10), 'I am the origin of all; from Me proceed everything' (10.8), and 'There is nothing higher than Me, O Arjuna' (7.7). From Me, the creator of everything, has streamed forth this ancient activity, continuing from time immermorial, of attachment to sense-objects consisting of Gunas. This has been declared already by Me:  'For this divine Maya of Mine consisting of the Gunas is hard to break through. But those who take refuge in me alone shall pass beyond this Maya' (7.14).

Or a variant of this stanza is 'prapadya iyatah pravrttih' (in place of 'prapadyet yatah pravrittih'). This gives the sense that this discipline of taking refuge in the Supreme Person for dispelling of ignorance has continued from a distant past. The tendencies of ancient persons seeking liberation are also ancient. The purport is this:  The ancient liberation-seekers, taking refuge in Me alone, were released from bondage. [This can be taken to mean that Prapatti or taking refuge in the Lord had originated in the Bhakti tradition of the Sri-Vaisnavites from ancient sages i.e., from the Alvars who preceded  Ramanuja by several centuries. It is not a creation of Ramanuja].
15.3 See Comment under 15.5
15.3 But, asya, its-of this Tree of the World which has been described; rupam, form, as it has been presented; na, is not at all; upalabhyate, perceived; iha, here; tatha, in that way. For, being like a dream, water in a mirage, jugglery, an imaginary city seen in the sky, it is by nature destroyed no sooner than it is seen. Therefore, na, there exists neither; its antah, end, limit, termination; so also, neither; its beginning. It is not comprehended by anyone that it comes into existence beginning from any definite point. Its sampratistha, continuance, the middle state, too, is not perceived by anyone.
Chittva, after felling, uprooting, together with its seeds; enam, this, above described; asvattham, Peepul, the Tree of the World; suvirudha-mulam, whose roots (mula) are well (su) developed (virudham); drdhena, with the strong-hardened by a resolute mind directed towards the supreme Self, and sharpened on the stone of repeated practice of discrimination; asanga-sastrena, sword of detachment-detachment means turn ing away from the desire for progeny, wealth and the worlds; with that sword of detachment-.
15.4 Then That goal should be sought for, whither having gone none returns again. I seek refuge in that Primeval Purusha Whence streamed forth the ancient activity or energy.
15.4 Beyond lies the Path, from which, when found, there is no return. This is the Primal God from whence this ancient creation has sprung.
15.4. Then that Abode must be sought, having reached Which one would not return.  [The Yogin] would attain nothing but that Primal Person from Whom the old activity (world creation) commences.
15.4 Then, one should seek that goal attaining which one never returns. One should seek refuge with that Primal Person from whom streamed forth this ancient activity.
15.4 Thereafter, that State has to be sought for, going where they do not return again: I take refuge in that Primeval Person Himself, from whom has ensued the eternal Manifestation.
15.3 - 15.4 The form of this tree, having its origin above, i.e., in the four-faced Brahma and branches below in the sense that man forms the crest through continual lineage therefrom, and also having its branches extended above and below by actions done in the human state and forming secondary roots - that form of the tree is not understood by people immersed in Samsara. Only this much is perceived:  'I am a man, the son of Devadatta, the father of Yajnadatta; I have property appropriate to these conditions'. Likewise, it is not understood that its destruction can be brought about by detachment from enjoyments which are based on Gunas. Similarly it is not perceived that attachment to the Gunas alone is the beginning of this (tree). Again, it is not perceived that the basis of this tree is founded on ignorance which is the misconception of self as non-self. Ignorance alone is the basis of this tree, since in it alone the tree is fixed.

As to how It is to be sought for, the Lord says: Prapadye, I take refuge; tam, in that; adyam, Primeval-existing from the beginning; purusam, Person, who has been mentioned by the word State; eva, Himself. The search has to be carried on thus, i.e., by taking refuge in Him.
Who is that Person? That is being stated: Yatah, from whom, from which Person; prasrta, has ensued, like jugglery from a magician; purani, the eternal; pravrttih, Manifestation, the magic Tree of the World.
What kind of persons reach that State? This is being answered:
15.5 Free from pride and delusion, victorious over the evil of attachment, dwelling constantly in the Self, their desires having completely turned away, freed from the pairs of opposites known as pleasure and pain, the undeluded reach the eternal goal.
15.5 The wise attain Eternity when, freed from pride and delusion, they have conquered their love for the things of sense; when, renouncing desire and fixing their gaze on the Self, they have ceased to be tossed to and fro by the opposing sensations, like pleasure and pain.
15.5. Those who are rid of pride and delusion; have put down the evils of attachment; remain constantly in their own nature of the Self; have their desires completely departed; and are fully liberated from the pairs known as pleasures and pains-these undeluded men go to that changeless Abode.
15.5 Without the delusion of perverse notions (concerning the self), victorious over the evil of attachment, ever devoted to the self, turned away from desires and liberated from dualities called pleasure and pain, the undeluded go to that imperishable status.
15.5 The wise ones who are free from pride and non-discrimination, who have conered the evil of association, [Hatred and love arising from association with foes and friends.] who are ever devoted to spirituality, completely free from desires, free from the dualities called happiness and sorrow, reach that undecaying State.
15.5 Thus, when they have taken refute in Me, become free from 'perverse notions conerning the self', namely, become free from the delusion in the form of misconceiving the non-self (body) as the self; 'victorious over the evil of attachment', namely, victorious over the evil known as attachment to sense-objects consisting of the Gunas; 'ever devoted to self', namely completely absorbed in the knowledge of the self which is called Adhyatma or knowledge about the self; when they have 'turned away from desires' other than this self-knowledge; when they are liberated from 'dualities called pleasure and pain' - such 'undeluded souls', namely, those who are able to discern the natures of self and non-self, attain to that 'imperishable status'. They attain the self as It is, in the form of infinite knowledge. Conseently for those who seek refuge in Me, all actions become easy of performance till perfection is attained by My grace.
15.3-5 Na rupam.,  upto avyayam tat.  Cutting this [tree] etc.  Here the action  [of cutting] mentioned with regard to the alified one  [viz৷৷ the tree]  appropriates for itself, the place  (or word) of alification [viz. the root below],  just as in the case of the injunction :  'Let the man-with-stick recite the Praisa hymns.  By this way  [we get the meaning] :  'Let him cut off the roots tha are grown below.  That Abode :  The absolutely  Tranil One.  The changeless Abode is nothing but That.
15.5 Amudhah, the wise ones, who are devoid of delusion; who are nirmana-mohah, free from (nir) pride (mana) and non-discrimination (moha); jita-sanga-dosah, who have conered (jita) the evil (dosa) of association (sanga)-association itself being the evil; those who have conered that; adhyatma-nityah, who are ever devoted to spirituality, ever engaged in reflecting on the nature of the supreme Self; engrossed in that; [Engrossed in hearing, reflecting and meditating on the Self.] vinivrtta-kamah, who are completely (vi) free from (nivrtta) desires (kamah), whose desires have completely gone away without trace (ni), the men of self-control, the monks; vimuktah, who are free from, have got rid of; dvandvaih, the dualities-likes, dislikes, etc.; sukha-duhkha-sanjnaih, called happiness and sorrow; gacchanti, reach; tat, that; avyayam, undecaying; padam, State, as has been described above.
The very State is being elaborated again:
15.6 Neither doth the sun illumine there nor the moon, nor the fire; having gone thither they return not; that is My supreme abode.
15.6 Neither sun, moon, nor fire shines there. Those who go thither never come back. For, O Arjuna, that is my Celestial Home!
15.6. The sun does not illumine That; nor the moon and  nor the fire;  That is My Abode Supreme, having gone to Which they (Yogins) never return.
15.6 That supreme light (i.e. the individual self), reaching which they do not return any more, is Mine; the sun does not illumine It, nor moon, nor the fire.
15.6 Neither the sun nor the moon nor fire illumines That. That is My supreme Abode, reaching which they do not return.
15.6 The sun cannot illumine the light of the self, nor moon, nor fire. For, knowledge is indeed that which illumines them all. External lights, however, are helpful only in removing the darkness which hinders the contact between the senses and the objects. It is the intelligence of the self that reveals such external lights. What reveals this (i.e., the self) is Yoga (i.e., meditation) only. Beginningless Karma is the hindrance. It has been taught that the way for the erasing of Karma is self-surrender to the Lord through detachment etc. That supreme light, reaching which they do not return any more is the self, which is My glory (Vibhuti) and therefore belongs to Me and is a part of Myself. Such is the meaning. The supremacy of this light (i.e., individual self) consists in its capacity to illumine the light of knowledge. Knowledge alone can illuminate all things (including the light of the sun which sheds only physical light on objects.).
15.6 Na tat etc.  There is no scope for the sun etc., in  [illumining] That. For, they are conditioned by time etc., because they are objects of  knowledge,  [and] because they are the helpers of the sense organs.  On the other hand,  That  [Absolute] is unrestricted by space, time etc.  It is the knower, the one inducer of the sense organs and also the one transcending them.
15.6 Na suryah, niether the sun-though possessed of the power of illumining everything; so also, na sasankah, nor the moon; na pavakah, nor even fire; bhasayate, illumines; tat, That [-this (word) refers to the remote word dhama (Abode) at the end of the verse-], that Abode which is of the nature of light. That abode, the State of Visnu, gatva, reaching, attaining; yat, which; they na, do not; nivartante, return, and which the sun etc. do not illumine; tat, that; is mama, My, Visnu's; paramam, supreme; dhama, Abode, State.
Objection: It has been said, 'reaching which they do not return'. Is it not well known that all goings end, verily, in returning, and unions are followed by separations? How is it said that there is no return for those who come to that Abode?
Reply: As to that, listen to the reason:
15.7 An eternal portion of Myself having become a living soul in the world of life, draws to (itself) the (five) senses with the mind for the sixth, abiding in Nature.
15.7 It is only a very small part of My Eternal Self, which is the life of the universe, drawing round itself the six senses, the mind the last, which have their source in Nature.
15.7. A portion just of My own Self, having become the eternal individual Soul in the world of the living ones, draws [into service] the sense organs, of which the sixth is the mind, and which rest in the Prakrti.
15.7 An everlasting part of Myself, having become the bound self in the world of life, attracts the senses, of which the mind is the sixth, and which abide in Prakrti.
15.7 It is verily a part of Mine which, becoming the eternal individual soul in the region of living beings, draws (to itself) the organs which have the mind as their sixth, and which abide in Nature.
15.7 That self, whose nature has been described thus, though constituting an everlasting  part of Myself, becomes the bound individual self in the world of life. Covered by ignorance in the form of beginningless Karma, It attracts to Itself the five senses and the mind, which are located in the bodies of gods, men etc., and which are particular transformations of Prakrti. Some parts of Myself (i.e., the selves), becoming free from ignorance (Avidya) in the aforesaid manner, remain in their own intrinsic nature. But the bound individual self is very much contracted in power and knowledge. The individual self is the lord of the senses and the mind in bodies, and forms a bound individual in combination with a particular transformation of the Prakrti through Karma. Thus Karma attracts the selves hither and thither according to its nature.
15.7 Mama etc. The individual Soul is a  portion just of the Brahman only :  Because, due to the attribute  (or, nature) viz., the nescience, the Self does not realise Its all pervaisveness and because the Consciousness is also not absent, It is figuratively referred to as portion [of the Brahman].  For, a real apportioning is not possible [in the Absolute].  For the scripture also says :
 
'In the case of the Brahman  (the Absolute), even the particular manifestation  (or a particular space) does not preclude Its all-comprehensive nature'.
 
This figurative usage may be resorted to wherever reired.  Hence there is no room for any difference of opinion.
15.7 It is eva, verily amsah, a part, portion, limb, fragment-these are all synonymous; mama, of mine, of the supreme Self; [Here Ast. adds 'narayanasya, of Narayana':-Tr.] which, jiva-bhutah sanatanah, becoming the eternal individual soul, will known as the enjoyer and agent; jiva-loke, in the region of living beings, (i.e.) in the world-.
As the sun (reflected) in water is a part of the (actual) sun, and goes to the sun itself and does not return when the water, the cause of the reflection, is removed, so also even this part becomes similarly united with that very Self; or, as space enclosed in a pot etc., delimited by such adjuncts as the pot etc., being a part of Space does not return after being united with Space when the cause (of limitation), viz pot etc., is destroyed. This being so, it has been rightly stated, 'by reaching which they do not return.'
Objection: How can the partless supreme Self have any limb, fragment or part? If it has limbs, then there arises the contingency of Its becoming destroyed through the dismemberment of the limbs!
Reply: This fault does not arise, since Its fragment, which is delimited by an adjunct arising out of ignorance, is imagined to be a part, as it were. And this idea has been fully explained in the chapter (13) dealing with the 'field'.
How that individual soul, imagined as a part of Mine, enters into the world and leaves the body are being stated: Karsati, it draws to itself; indriyani, the (sense-) organs-ear etc.; manah-sasthani, which have the mind as their sixth; and prakrti-sthani, which abide in Nature, which are located in their respective spheres such as the orifice of the ear etc.
When (does it draw the organs)?
15.8 When the Lord (as the individual soul) obtains a body and when He leaves it, He takes these and goes (with them) as the wind takes the scents from their seats (flowers, etc.).
15.8 When the Supreme Lord enters a body or leaves it, He gathers these senses together and travels on with them, as the wind gathers perfume while passing through the flowers.
15.8. Whatsoever body he attains to and also from whatsoever He goes up, the Lord proceeds taking them with Him just as the wind takes odours from their receptacle.
15.8 Whatever body Its lord acires and from whatever body It departs, It goes on Its way, taking these senses as the wind carrying scents from their places.
15.8 When the master leaves it and even when he assumes a body, he departs taking these, as wind (carries away) odours from their receptacles.
15.8 Whatever body It acires, and from whatever body It departs, the lord of the senses, i.e., the self, goes on Its way taking with It the senses with the subtle elements, just like the wind carrying scents from place to place. Just as the wind takes away scents with subtle parts from flower-garlands, sandal, musk and the rest from their places and moves elsewhere - so does the self.

What are these senses?  Sri Krsna explains:
15.8 Sariram etc.  Attains to :  seizes.  Goes up :  abandones along with them. Just as the wind, going everywhere reaches an abode of rest made of earth and carrying away thence an odour enters just with that into another place, in the same way does the individual Soul together with the octad of cities.			
 So far the association of the individual Soul with them  ( the sense organs etc.) at both the stages of creation and of withdrawal has been described.  Now it is being decided that It acts only in association with them even at the stage of existence which consists of acts like standing, sitting, contemplating etc. and which is a stage of receiving objects-
15.8 Yat, when; isvarah, the master of the aggregate of the body etc., the individual soul; utkramati, leaves the body, then he draws. Thus, the second arter of the verse is treated first for the sake of consistency. [When the soul leaves the body, then it draws the organs (see previous verses) from that body. In this way, the second arter of the present verse is treated first, because going to another body follows the leaving of the earlier one.-M.S.]
Ca api, and even; yat, when; it avapnoti, assumes a body other than the earlier one; then, grahitva, taking; etani, these, the organs with the mind as their sixth; samyati, he leaves, goes away totally [Samyak, totally-without returning in any way to the earlier body.-M.S.] Like what? In reply the Lord says: iva, as; vayuh, the wind (carries away); gandhan, odours; asayat, from their receptacles-flowers etc.
Which, again, are those (organs)?
15.9 Presiding over the ear, the eye, touch, taste and smell, as well as the mind, it enjoys the objects of the senses.
15.9 He is the perception of the ear, the eye, the touch, the taste and the smell, yea and of the mind also; and the enjoyment the things which they perceive is also His.
15.9. Presiding  over the ear, the eye, the touch-sense the taste-sense and also the smell-sense and the mind, He enjoys the sense objects.
15.9 Presiding over the ear, the eye, the sense of touch, the tongue and the nose, and the mind, It experiences these objects of senses.
15.9 This one enjoys the objects by presiding over the ear, eyes, skin and tongue as also the nose and the mind.
15.9 Presiding over these sense-organs, of which the mind is the sixth, the lord of the body drives the organs towards their corresponding objects like sound and the rest and enjoys them.
15.9 See Comment under 15.11
15.9 Seated in the body, it upasevate, enjoys; visayan, the objects-sound etc.; adhisthaya, by presiding over; srotram, the ear; caksuh, eyes; sparsanam, skin, the organ of touch; rasanam, tongue; eva ca, as also; the ghranam, nose; and manah, the mind, the sixth-(presiding over) each one of them along with its (corresponding) organ.
16.1 The Blessed Lord said  Fearlessness, purity of heart, steadfastness in knowledge and Yoga, almsgiving, control of the senses, sacrifice, study of scriptures, austerity and straightforwardness.
16.1 "Lord Shri Krishna continued: Fearlessness, clean living, unceasing concentration on wisdom, readiness to give, self-control, a spirit of sacrifice, regular study of the scriptures, austerities, candour,
16.1. The Bhagavat said  Fearlessness, complete purity of the Sattva, steadfastness in knowledge-Yoga, charity, and self-restraint and [Vedic] sacrifice, recitation of scriptures, austerity, uprightness;
16.1 The Lord said  Fearlessness, purity of mind, devotion to meditation on the knowledge (of the self), alms-giving, self-control, worship, study of Vedas, austerity, uprightness:
16.1 The Blessed Lord said  Fearlessness, purity of mind, persistence in knowledge and yoga, charity and control of the external organs, sacrifice, (scriptural) study, austerity and recititude;
16.1 The Lord said  'Fear' is the pain arising from the awareness of the cause which brings about pain in the form of either dissociation from the objects of attainment or association with the objects of aversion. The absence of this is 'fearlessness'. 'Purity of mind' is the condition of Sattva, viz., the state of the internal organ being untouched by Rajas and Tamas. 'Devotion to meditation on the knowledge (of the self)' is firm adherence to the discrimination between the pure nature of the self and Prakrti. 'Alms-giving' is the giving away of one's wealth earned through right means to the deserving. 'Self-control' is the practice of withdrawal of the mind from sense-objects. 'Worship' is the performance of the fivefold duties (sacrifices) etc., of life in the spirit of worship of the Lord without attachment to the fruits. The 'study of the Vedas' is devotion to the Vedic study with the conviction that all the teachings of the Vedas deal with the Lord, with His glorious nature and with the mode of worshipping Him. 'Austerity' is the practice of penances like Krchra, Candrayana, vow on the twelfth day of the lunar fortnight, etc., which foster capability for performing acts pleasing to the Lord. 'Uprightness' consists of the oneness of thought, word and deed in one's dealings with others.

16.1 Abhayam, fearlessness; sattva-samsuddhih, purtiy of the mind (sattva), mentally avoiding fraud, trickery, falsehood, etc. in dealings, i.e., honest behaviour; jnana-yoga-vyavasthitih, persistence in knowledge and yoga-jnana means knowledge of such subjects as the Self, learnt from scriptures and teachers; yoga means making those things that have been learnt matters of one's own personal experience through concentration by means of withdrawl of the organs etc.; persistence, steadfastness, in those two, knowledge and yoga;-this [This-refers to all the three from 'fearlessness' to 'persistence in knowledge and yoga'.] is the principal divine characteristic which is sattvika (born of the sattva ality). That nature which may occur in persons competent in their respective spheres, [Persons treading the path of Jnana-yoga or Karma-yoga have sattvika alities. Some of the alities mentioned in the first three verses occur only in the former, whereas the others are found in both or only in the latter.-Tr.]-that is said to be their sattvika attribute.
Danam, charity, distribution of food etc. according to one's ability; and damah, control of the external organs-the control of the internal organ, santih, will be referred to later; yajnah, sacrifices-Agnihotra etc. sanctioned by the Vedas, and sacrifices in honour of gods and others [Others: Those in honour of the manes, humans and other beings. Brahma-yajna, the fifth sacrifice, is referred to separately by svadhyaya.] sanctioned by the Smrtis: svadhyayah, study of the Rg-veda etc. for unseen results; tapah, austerity, those concerning the body, etc., which will be stated (17.14-16); arjavam, rectitude, straigthforwardness at all times-.

16.10 Filled with insatiable desires, full of hypocrisy, pride and arrogance, holding evil ideas through delusion, they work with impure resolves.
16.10 Giving themselves up to insatiable passions, hypocritical, self-sufficient and arrogant, cherishing false conception founded on delusion, they work only to carry out their own unholy purposes.
16.10. Holding to their  insatiable desire; being possessed by hypocricy, avarice, and pride; and holding evil intention, these cruel men wander with impure resolve.
16.10 Turning to insatiable desires, seizing through delusion unjustly acired wealth, and following impious vows, they act, full of ostentation, pride and arrogance.
16.10 Giving themselves up to insatiable passion, filled with vanity, pride and arrogance, adopting bad abjectives due to delusion, and having impure resolves, they engage in actions.
16.10 Turning to 'insatiable desires,' viz., which concern objects impossible to get; seizing through 'delusion,' viz., through ignorance that such desires can be fulfilled only with 'unjustly acired wealth,' viz., with wealth unlawfully hoarded, and following impious vows, viz., associated with the vows prohibited in the Sastras; they do actions 'that are full of ostentation, pride and arrogance.'
16.10 See Coment under 16.12

Further,
16.11 Giving themselves over to immeasurable cares ending only with death, regarding gratification of lust as their highest aim, and feeling sure that that is all.
16.11 Poring anxiously over evil resolutions, which only end in death; seeking only the gratification of desire as the highest goal; seeing nothing beyond;
16.11. Adhering to  their anxiety that is ultimited and may end only at the time of dissolution; viewing the  gratification of their desires alone as their highest goal; ascertaining that this much alone exists;
16.11 Obsessed by unlimited cares which end with dissolution, looking upon enjoyment of desires as their highest aim, and convinced that this is all;
16.11 Beset with innumerable cares which end (only) with death, holding that the enjoyment of desirable objects is the highest goal, feeling sure that this is all.
16.11 Those who are sure to die today or tomorrow 'obsess themselves with cares' in regard to objects the attainment of which is not possible even by the time of death. Likewise, they look upon 'enjoyment of desires' as their highest aim, viz., they regard the satisfaction of sensual enjoyments as the highest aim of human life. They are convinced that this is all, viz., they are assured that there is no value in human life greater than this.
16.11 See Coment under 16.12
16.11 Upasritah, beset with; aparimeyam, innumerable; cintam, cares-worries that defy estimation of their limits!, i.e., constantly burdened with cares; pralayantam, which end (only) with death; kama-upabhoga-paramah, holding that the enjoyment of desirable objects is the highest goal-kama is derived in the sense of 'that which is desired for', viz sound etc.; considered their enjoyment to be the highest; having their minds convinced thus that this alone, viz the enjoyment of desirable objects, is the highest human goal; niscitah, feeling sure; iti, that; etavat, this is all-

16.12 Bound by hundreds of fetters of hopes, given over to desire and anger, they strive unjustly to gather wealth for the gratification of their desires.
16.12 Bound by hundreds of shackles in the form of hope, giving themselves wholly to passion and anger, they endeavour to amass wealth through foul means for the enjoyment of desirable objects.
16.12 They are 'bound by hundreds of fetters of hope,' viz., bound by hundreds of fetters in the form of hope. They are given over to 'desire and anger,' viz., they are intent solely on desire and anger. To satisfy their sensual desires, they endeavour for wealth through immortal means.
16.9-12 Etam etc. upto arthasancayam :  Their anxiety ends only at the time of dissolution i.e. never ceases, becaue the rise and dissolution never end.  This much alone :  For them the highest goal to be achieved is but the gratification of desires, and when this (aim) is just ruined, there arises anger.  Hence the Lord says 'Devoted to their craving and anger'.
16.12 Baddhah, bound, being impelled, being lured from all sides; asa-pasa-sataih, by hundreds of shackles in the from of hope-the hopes themselves are the shackles; by hundreds of these; kama-krodha-parayanah, giving themselves wholly to passion and anger, having passion and anger as their highest resort; ihante, they endeavour; artha-sancayan, to amass wealth; anyayena, through foul means, i.e. by stealing others' wealth, etc.; kama-bhoga-artham, for the enjoyment of desirable objects-in order to enjoy desirable objects, not for righteous acts.
Their intentions, too, are of this kind:
16.13 "This has been gained by me today; this desire of mine I shall fuffil; this is mine and this wealth also shall be mine in future."
16.13 This I have gained today; tomorrow I will gratify another desire; this wealth is mine now, the rest shall be mine ere long;
16.13. 'This has been gained by me to-day; this object of my desire I shall attain in future; this is mine [now]; and this wealth also shall be mine [soon]';
16.13 'This I have gained today, and this desire I shall attain. This wealth is mine, and this also shall be mine hereaftter .
16.13 'This has been gained by me today; I shall acire this desired object. This is in hand; again, this wealth also will come to me.'
16.13 This land, sons etc., have I gained solely by my ability and not by the help of any higher force. I shall attain this desire also myself and not by good fortune or any other means. This wealth, gained solely by my ability, is with me. And this also shall be mine through my own ability.
16.13 See Coment under 16.16
16.13 Idam, this thing; labham, has been gained; maya, by me; adya, today; prapsye, I shall acire; idam, this other; manoratham, desired object which is delectable to the mind. And idam, this; asti, is in hand; punah, again; idam, this; dhanam, wealth; api, also; bhavisyati, will come; me, to me, in the next year. Thery I shall become rich and famous.
16.14 "That enemy has been slain by me; and others also I shall slay. I am the lord. I enjoy. I am perfect, powerful and happy."
16.14 I have slain one enemy, I will slay the others also; I am worthy to enjoy, I am the Almighty, I am perfect, powerful and happy;
16.14. 'That enemy has been slain by me; and I shall slay others also;  I am the lord; I am a man of enjoyment;  I am successful, mighty and happy';
16.14 'This enemy is slain by me; and others also I shall slay. I am the Lord, I am the enjoyer, I am successful, I have strength, I have happiness.
16.14 'That enemy has been killed by me, and I shall kill others as well. I am the lord, I am the enjoyer, I am well-established, mighty and happy.'
16.14 This enemy has been slain by me, powerful as I am. I shall slay other enemies also - I who am heoric and valiant. What is the use of the conception of destiny, which is only an imagination of weak people of little understanding?

Similarly:

I am 'the lord,' viz., I am independent, and I am also the ruler of others. I am the 'enjoyer,' viz., I am the enjoyer through my own powers, and not through good fortune etc. I am 'successful,' viz., I am successful by myself and not through any destiny etc. Likewise, I am strong and happy by myself.
16.14 See Coment under 16.16
16.14 Asau, that; unconerable satruh, enemy, named Devadatta; hatah, has been killed; naya, by me; and hanisye, I shall kill; aparan, the other wretched ones. What will these pitiable persons do? There is none eal to me at all. Aham, I; am the isvarah, lord; I am the bhogi, enjoyer; and I am siddhah, well-established in every respect-I am blessed with sons, and grandsons born of sons and daughters. Not only am I a man, but I am also balavan, mighty; and I myself am sukhi, happpy; others are born to be but a burden to the earth!
16.15 "I am rich and born in a noble family. Who else is equal to me? I shall perform sacrifices. I shall give (charity). I shall rejoice," thus deluded by ignorance.
16.15 I am rich, I am well-bred; who is there to compare with me? I will sacrifice, I will give, I will pay - and I will enjoy. Thus blinded by Ignorance,
16.15. 'I am rich;  I am of of noble birth; who else is eal ot me ?  I shall  perform sacrifices;  I shall give gifts; and I shall rejoice' - deluded by these wrong ideas;
16.15 ' I am wealthy and high-born; who else is eal to me?  I shall sacrifice, I shall give alms, I shall rejoice.' Thus they think, deluded byignorance.
16.15 'I am rich and high-born; who else is there similar to me? I shall perform sacrifices; I shall give, I shall rejoice,'-thus they are diversely deluded by non-discrimination.
16.15 'I am rich by myself. Who else is there in this world like me gaining all glory with his own ability?  I myself shall sacrifice, I shall give alms and I shall rejoice' - thus they think deluded by ignorance, viz., deluded by ignorance that they are themselves capable of offering sacrifices, gifts etc., unaided by the grace of God.
16.15 See Coment under 16.16
16.15 Adhyah, I am rich in wealth; abhi-janavan, high-born in respect of my lineage; my seven generations are endowed with Vedic learnig etc. From that point of view also there is none eal to me. Kah anyah, who else; asti, is there; sadrsah, similar; maya, to me? Besides, yaksye, I shall perform sacrifices; in respect of sacrifices also I shall defeat others. Dasyami, I shall give-to actors and others; modisye, I shall rejoice, and I shall derive intense joy. Iti, thus; are they ajnana-vimohitah, diversely deluded by non-discrimination, subject to various indiscrimination.
16.16 Bewildered by many a fancy, entangled in the snare of delusion, addicted to the gratification of lust, they fall into a foul hell.
16.16 Perplexed by discordant thoughts, entangled in the snares of desire, infatuated by passion, they sink into the horrors of hell.
16.16. Endowed with many thoughts; confused  highly; enslaved simply by their delusion; and addicated to the gratification of desires;  they fall into the hell and into what is foul.
16.16 Bewildered by many thoughts, ensnared by the net of delusion, addicted to sensual enjoyments, they fall into a foul Naraka.
16.16 Bewildered by numerous thoughts, caught in the net of delusion, (and) engrossed in the enjoyment of desirable objects, they fall into a foul hell.
16.16 As do not accept the need for the help of past Karma and the Lord for their achievements and believe them to be only due to their own efforts, they are 'bewildered' by many thoughts, 'Thus I shall do, this I shall accomplish, and still another I shall achieve.' In this way they are ensnared by the net of delusion. Highly addicted to sensual enjoyments, they die in the middle of such enjoyments and fall into foul Naraka [Naraka is sometimes translated as hell. This is the Christian conception. In the Hindu view it is purgatory where through intense sufferings the Jiva is purged of sins].
16.13-16 Idam adya etc. upto asucau.  Endowed with many thoughts etc.  For, they do not have any conviction. Into the hell and what is foul :  in the [hell] Avici and the  like and in the regular succession of  birth and death.
16.16 Aneka-citta-vibhrantah, bewildered by numerous thoughts, confounded variously by thoughts of the kind stated above; moha-jala-samavrtah, caught in the net of delusion-moha is non-discrimination, lack of understanding; that itself is like a net because of its nature of covering; enshrouded by that; prasaktah, engrossed; kama-bhogesu, in the enjoyment of desirable objects, being immersed in that itself; they patanti, fall, owing to the sins accumulated thery; asucau, into a foul; narake, hell, such as Vaitarani. [Vaitarani: It is the most terrible place of punishment; a river filled with all kinds of filth-blood, hair, bones etc., and running with great impetuosity, hot and fetid. The other hells are Tamisra, Andhatamisra, Raurava, Kumbhipaka, and so on.]
16.17 Self-conceited, stubborn, filled with the pride and intoxication of wealth, they perform sacrifices in name out of ostentation, contrary to scriptural ordinances.
16.17 Self-conceited, stubborn, rich, proud and insolent, they make a display of their patronage, disregarding the rules of decency.
16.17. Self-conceited, stubborn, filled with pride and arrogance of  wealth, they pretend to perform sacrifices with hypocricy, not following injunction [of the Vedas].
16.17 Self-conceited, self-sufficient, possessed of the intoxication of wealth and pride, they perform sacrifices in name only, with ostentation and not according to the injunctions of the Sastras.
16.17 Self-conceited, haughty, filled with pride and intoxication of wealth, they perform sacrifices which are so in name only, with ostentation and regardless of the injunctions.
16.17 They are held in 'high esteem by themselves'; the meaning is they are full of the sense of self-esteem. They feel self-sufficient, viz., regarding themselves as perfect, they do nothing. How?  They are 'possessed of the intoxication of wealth and pride,' viz., they are intoxicated by wealth and pride of wealth, learning and descent. They perform sacrifices in name only,' viz., they perform sacrifices for the fame of it, the purpose being gaining fame as the performers of sacrifice. These are performed for ostentation acutated with the motive of becoming famous as the performers of sacrifices and not in accordance with the proper rulesof the Sastras, viz., without regard to any ?ndment.

Sri Krsna says that they perform sacrifices in the following manner:
16.17 See Coment under 16.20
16.17 Atma-sambhavitah, self-conceited, considering themselves by themselves to be possessed of good alities-not considered to be so by holy men; stabdhah, haughty, having minds that are not humble; dhana-mana-mada-anvitah, filled with (anvita) the pride (mana) and intoxication (mada) of wealth (dhana); te, they; yajnate, perform sacrifices; namayajnaih, which are so in name only; dambhena, with ostentation, with religious hypocricy; avidhi-purvakam, regardless of the injunctions-without subsidiary rites and proper methods of performance as enjoined.
16.18 Given over to egoism, power, haughtiness, lust and anger, these malicious people hate Me in their own bodies and in those of others.
16.18 Puffed up by power and inordinate conceit, swayed by lust and wrath, these wicked people hate Me Who am within them, as I am within all.
16.18. Clinging fast to egotism, force, pride, craving, and anger, these envious men hate Me in the bodies of their own and of others.
16.18 Depending on their egoism, power and pride, and also of desire and wrath, these malicious men hate Me in their own bodies and in those of others.
16.18 Resorting to egotism, power, arrogance, passion and anger, hating Me in their own and others' bodies, (they become) [As the finite verb is missing in the verse, we have supplied 'they become'. S. adds the verb prabhavanti, wax strong, from verse 9, and constructs the last portion thus: '৷৷.the envious ones wax strond.' Following S. S., however, one may combine this verse with the preceding verse by taking 'perform sacrifices' as the finite verb.-Tr.'] envious by nature.
16.18 They depend on their egoism in the form of 'I can do everything without the help of anyone'; likewise, in performing everything they depend on their power, 'My power is sufficient'; hence pride takes the following form, 'There is nobody like myself. Desire takes the form of, 'Because I am so, everything is fulfilled by my mere desire.' 'Wrath consits in conceiving, 'I shall slay those who cause evil to me.' Thus, depending on themselves, they evince malice towards Me, the Supreme Person abiding in their own bodies as well as in the bodies of others; and they hate Me. They endeavour to invent fallacious arguments against My existence, and being unable to tolerate Me, they perform all acts like sacrifices etc., depending only on their egoism.
16.18 See Coment under 16.20
16.18 Ahankaram, egotism-that which considers the Self to which have been imputed actual and imaginary alities as 'I am this', which is called ignorance and is most painful, and is the source of all ills as also of all evil deeds; so also balam, power, which seeds to defear others and is associated with passion and desire; darpam, arrogance, a particular defect abiding in the mind, on the upsurge of which one transgresses righteousness; kamam, passion with regard to women and others; krodham, anger at things tha are undesirable;-samsritah, resorting to these and other great evils; and further, pradvisantah, hating; mam, Me, God-transgression of My ?nds is hatred (towards Me); indulging in that, atma-para-dehesu, in their own and others' bodies as the witness of their intellects and actions; (they become) abhyasuyakah, envious by nature, intolerant of the alities of those who tread the right path.

16.19 Those who hate Me in this manner, I hurl them, the cruel, inauspicious and the vilest of mankind into the cycle of births and deaths for ever, viz., old age, death etc., revolving again and again, and even there into demoniac wombs. I hurl them into births, antagonistic to any friendliness towards Me. The meaning is that I shall connect them to cruel minds as would impel them to actions which lead them to the attainment of cursed births.

Besides,
16.20 Entering into demoniacal wombs and deluded, birth after birth, not attaining Me, they thus fall, O Arjuna, into a condition still lower than that.
16.20 So reborn, they spend life after life, enveloped in delusion. And they never reach Me, O Prince, but degenerate into still lower forms of life.
16.20. Having come to the demoniac womb, birth after birth, and not attaining Me at all, these deluded persons, therefore, pass to the lowest state, O son of  Kunti !
16.20 Fallen into demoniac wombs in birth after birth, these deluded men, not attaining Me, further sink down to the lowest level, O Arjuna.
16.20 Being born among the demoniacal species in births after births, the foods, without ever reaching Me, O son of Kunti, attain conditions lower than that.
16.20 'These deluded men,' viz., those entertaining perverse knowledge about Me, attain repeatedly births that tend them to be antagonistic to Me. Never 'attaining Me,' viz., never arriving at the knowledge that Vasudeva, the Lord and the ruler of all, truly exists, they go farther and farther down, from that birth, to the lowest level.

Sri Krsna proceeds to explain the root-cause of the ruin to the self of demoniac nature:
16.17-20 Atmasambhavitah etc. upto gatim.  They pretend to perform sacrifices :  The meaning is that their sacrifice is fruitless.  Indeed all is ruined because of their anger.  Or, namayjna  [may mean]  'the sacrifices which are in name only'.  Or, it [may denote] those sacrifices that are performed for one's name sake i.e., for one's reputation, because of which one gets the appellation as  'He is performer  of [such and such]  sacrifices'  These sacrifices, performed out of hypocricy alone, do not , however fetch any fruit.  Becasue these persons are rugged with anger etc., they hate people and by that they hate Me only [in fact]. For, I, the Vasudeva (the Universal Soul), dwell every-where.  Entertaining hatred towards their  own Soul, they perform action, that is hostile to themselves, and responsible for their own fall into the hells.  These persons I hurl into nothing but the demoniac wombs.
16.20 Apannah, being born, having acired; (births) asurim, among the demoniacal; yonim, species; janmani janmani, in births after births; the mudhah, fools, non-discriminating ones; being born in every birth into species in which tamas prevails, and going downwards, aprapya eva, without ever reaching, approaching; mam, Me, who am God; O son of Kunti, yanti, they attain; gatim, conditions; tatah adhamam, lower even than that.
Since there is not the least possibility of attaining Me, what is implied by saying, 'without ever reachin Me', is, 'by not attaining the virtuous path enjoined by Me.'
This is being stated as a summary of all the demoniacal alities. The triplet-under which are comprehended all the different demoniacal alities though they are infinite in number, (and) by the avoidance of which (three) they (all the demaniacal alities) become rejected, and which is the root of all evils- is being stated:
16.21 Triple is the gate of this hell, destructive of the self  lust, anger and greed; therefore one should abandon these three.
16.21 The gates of hell are three: lust, wrath and avarice. They destroy the Self. Avoid them.
16.21. To the hell, three-fold is the gate that ruins the Self : [They are]  desire, anger as well as greed.  Hence one should avoid these three.
16.21 Desire, wrath and greed - this is the triple gateway to Naraka, ruinous to the self. Therefore one should abandon these three.
16.21 This door of hell, which is the destroyer of the soul, is of three kinds-passion, anger and also greed. Therefore one should forsake these three.
16.21 Those three which constitute the 'gateway of this hell' in the shape of demoniac nature, and are destructive of the self (Atman) - are known as desire, wrath and greed. The nature of these has already been explained. 'Gateway' (Dvara) means the path, the cause. Therefore, one should renounce these three. Therefore, since they constitute the cause of the extremely dreadful Naraka, one should wholly renounce this triad - desire, wrath and greed.
16.21 See Coment under 16.22
16.21 Idam, this; dvaram, door; narakasya, of hell-for entering it; which is the nasanam, destroyer; atmanah, of the soul; is trividham of three kinds. It is that by the mere entry into which the soul perishes, i.e., it ceases to be fit for attaining any human goal. hence it is said that it is the door which is the destroyer of the soul. Which is that? Kamah, passion; krodhah, anger; and also lobhah, greed. Tasmat, therefore; tyajet, one shoud forsake; etat trayam, these three. Since this door is the destroyer of the soul, therefore one should renounce this group of three-passion etc. This is a eulogy of renunciation.
16.22 A man who is liberated from these three gates to darkness, O Arjuna, practises what is good for him and thus goes to the Supreme Goal.
16.22 These are the gates which lead to darkness; if a man avoid them he will ensure his own welfare, and in the end will attain his liberation.
16.22. O son of   Kunti !  A man, who has deserted these three gates of darkness, does what is good for his Self and thery reaches the highest goal.
16.22 One who has been released from these threefold gates of darkness, O Arjuna, works for the good of the self. Hence he reaches the supreme state.
16.22 O son of Kunti, a person who is free from these three doors to darkness strives for the good of the soul. Thery he attains the highest Goal.
16.22 One who has been 'released from these three' - from desire, wrath and greed which constitute the gates of darkness causing erroneous knowledge of Myself -, he works for the good of the self. Gaining knowledge of Myself, he endevaours to be inclined towards Me. From there, he attains the supreme goal, which is Myself.

Sri Krsna now teaches that the main cause of this Kind of degeneration is lack of reverence for the Sastras:
16.21-22 Trividham etc. Etaih etc.  Because the traid of desire etc.,  constitute the gate to the hell, therefore one should avoid that.					
 What has been stated should not be neglected on the assumption that it is  [based on]  the human word.  On the other hand, there is the authority of the eternal scripture on this subject.  This is said [here] –
16.22 O son of Kunti, narah, a person; who is vimuktah, free; etaih, from these; tribhih, three; tamo-dvaraih, doors to darkness, i.e., passion etc. which are doors to the darkness of hell consisting of sorrow and delusion; freed from three three which are such, acarati, strives for;-for what?-sreyah, the good; atmanah, of the soul: darred by which (doors) he could not strive earlier, and on the dispelling of which he strives. Tatah, thery, as a result of that striving; yati, he attains; the param, suprme; gatim, Goal, i.e. Liberation, as well. [Not only does he attain Liberation by renouncing the demoniacal alities, but he also secures happiness in this world.]
The scripture is instrumental in this complete renunciation of the demoniacal alities and striving for what is good. Both can be undertaken on the authority of the scriptures, not otherwise. Hence,
16.23 He who, having cast aside the ordinances of the scriptures, acts under the impulse of desire, attains not perfection, nor happiness nor the Supreme Goal.
16.23 But he who neglects the commands of the scriptures, and follows the promptings of passion, he does not attain perfection, happiness or the final goal.
16.23. He, who neglects the injunction of the scriptures, and acts according to his own will-he attains neither the success, nor happiness nor the highest goal (emancipation).
16.23 He who, abandoning the injunctions of the Sastras, acts under the influence of desire, attains neither perfection nor pleasure, nor the supreme state.
16.23 Ignoring the precept of the scriptures, he who acts under the impulsion of passion,-he does not attain perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme Goal.
16.23 Here Sastra means Vedas. Vidhi stands for injunction. He who abandons My injunction called Vedas and acts under the influence of desire, viz., takes the path according to his own wishes, does not attain perfection, He does not reach any Siddhi in the next world, nor does he find the slighest happiness in this world, let alone the attainment of the supreme state. It is not possible for him to do so. Such is the meaning.
16.23 See Coment under 16.24
16.23 Utsrjiya, ignoring, setting aside; sastra-vidhim, the precept of the scriptures, which is th source of the knoweldge of what is duty and what is not-called injunction and prohibition; yah, he who; vartate, acts; kama-karatah, under the impulsion of passion; sah, he; na, does not; avapnoti, attain; siddhim, perfection, fitness for Liberation; nor even sukham, happiness in this world; nor even the param, supreme best; gatim, Goal-heaven or Liberation.
16.24 Therefore, let the scripture be thy authority in determining what ought to be done and what ought not to be done. Having known what is said in the ordinance of the scriptures, thou shouldst act here in this world.
16.24 Therefore whenever there is doubt whether thou shouldst do a thing or not, let the scriptures guide thy conduct. In the light of the scriptures shouldst thou labour the whole of thy life."
16.24. Therefore, by considering the scripture as your authority in determining as to what is to be done and what is not to be done, you should perform action, laid down by the regulations of the scriptures.
16.24 Therefore, let the Sastra be your authority for determining what should be done and what should not be done. Knowing what is enjoined in the injunctions of the Sastra, you should perform work here.
16.24 Therefore, the scripture is your authority as regards the determination of what is to be done and what is not to be done. After understanding (your) duty as presented by scriptural injunction, you ought to perform (your duty) here.
16.24 Hence, the Sastra is to be the only authority for you in determining what should be done and what should not be done, viz., in deciding what ought to be accepted and what ought not be accepted. You should know, i.e., understand, neither more nor less than what constitutes the truth and the work enjoined in the injunctions of the Sastras which the Highest Reality called the Supreme Person revealed in the Vedas. The Vedic injunctions are supplemented by the Dharma-sastras, the Itihasas and the Puranas. The acts enjoined by them are the means for reaching Him and for pleasing Him. You should perform them; you should accept them alone.
16.23-24  Yah sastravidhim  etc.  Tasmat etc.  On the other hand, a  fall into the hell is [inevitable] for a person who rejects the scriptural injunctions and makes, using his own intellect, an analysis as to what is to be done and what is not to be done.  Therefore, don't make a decision with your intellect about what is to be done and what is not to be done.-This is what is intended to be conveyed here.
16.24 Tasmat, therefore; sastram, the scripure; is te, your; pramanam, authority, the means of knowledge; karya-akarya-vyavasthitau, as regards the determination of what is to be done and what is not to be done. Therefore, jnatva, after understanding; that which is your own karma, duty; sastra-vidhana-uktam, as presented by scriptural injunction-vidhana is the same as vidhi, precept, in the form, 'you should do', 'you should not do'; as presented by that; arhasi, you ought; kartum, to perform; it iha, here. 'Here' is used for pointing out the sphere in which one is intitled to perform his duties.

16.3 Vigour, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, absence of hatred, absence of pride  these belong to the one born for a divine state, O Arjuna.
16.3 Valour, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, freedom from hate and vanity; these are his who possesses the Godly Qualities, O Arjuna!
16.3. Vital power, forgiveness, fortitude, contenment, absence of treachery and absence of excessive pride-these are in the person who is born for divine wealth, O Descendant of Bharata !
16.3 Grandeur, patience, fortitude, purity, freedom from hatred, and from over-pride - these, O Arjuna, belong to him who is born to a divine destiny.
16.3 Vigour, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, freedom from malice, absence of haughtiness-these, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, are (the alties) of one born destined to have the divine nature.
16.3 'Grandeur' is the ality by virtue of which one cannot be overpowered by the wicked. 'Forgiveness' is freedom from the feelings of antagonism towards others even when they cause injury to oneself. 'Fortitude' is the sense of determination to do one's own duty even under conditions of great danger. 'Purity' is fitness of the body and the mind as prescribd in the scriptures for the performance of sacred deeds. 'Freedom from hatred' is non-interference with others, viz., absence of interference in the actions of others according to their wish. 'Over-pride' (Atimanita) is having unbridled self-esteem; freedom from misplaced pride is meant here.

These are the virtues that are found in one who is born for the 'divine destiny.' The destiny associated with the divinities is divine. The divinities are those who are devoted to carry out the ?ndments of the Lord. It is their destiny. It is obedience to the ?ndments of the Lord. The meaning is that these are endowments in those who are born with a tendency or disposition towards them and seek to attain their fulfilment.
6.3 See Coment under 16.5
16.3 Tajah, vigour, not the brightness of the skin; ksama, forgiveness, absence of internal perturbation when offened or assulated-absence of anger has been explained by us as the calming down of a perturbed mind; thus, forgiveness and absence of anger are distinguished; dhrtih, fortitude, a particular function of the mind which removes the tedium of the body and organs when they become exhausted, and being rejuvenated by which the body and organs do not feel any fatigue; saucam, purity-is of two kinds: external, with the help of earth and water; and internal, the cleanliness of mind and intellect, the absence of such impurities as trickery, attachment, etc.; purity of these two kinds; adrohah, freedom from malice, absence of the desire to injure others, absence of hatred; na-atimanita, absence of haughtiness-too much self-esteem (mana) is atimanah; one having that is atimani; its abstract form is atimanita; absence of that, na-atimanita, i.e., absence of the feeling of one's being too honourable. These (alities) beginning with fearlessness and ending with this, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, bhavanti, are; (the alities) abhijatasya, of one destined to have;-what kind of nature?-the daivim, divine; sampadam, nature-of one destined to have divine attributes, of one who is worthy of the excellence of the gods, i.e., of one who would be illustrations in future.
Thereafter, the demoniacal nature is now being stated:
16.4 Hypocrisy, arrogance and self-conceit, anger and also harshness and ignorance, belong to one who is born for a demoniacal state, O Partha (Arjuna).
16.4 Hypocrisy, pride, insolence, cruelty, ignorance belong to him who is born of the godless qualities.
16.4. Ostentation, arrogance, pride, anger, and also harshness, and ignorance, are in the person born for the demoniac wealth,  O son of  Prtha !
16.4 Pomposity, arrogance, self-conceit, wrath, rudeness and ignorance - these, O Arjuna, belong to him who is born to a demoniac destiny.
16.4 O son of Prtha, (the attributes) of one destined to have the demoniacal nature are religious ostentation, pride and haughtiness, [Another reading is abhimanah, self-conceit.-Tr.], anger as also rudeness and ignorance.
16.4 'Dambha or pomposity' is the practice of Dharma for earning a reputation for righteousness. 'Arrogance' is the elation caused by the pleasures of sense-objects and the conseent inability to discriminate between what ought to be done and what ought not to be done. 'Self-conceit' is the estimation of oneself in a measure not warranted by one's education and birth. 'Wrath' is the sense of antagonism causing injury to others. 'Rudeness' is the nature of causing grief to Sadhus. 'Ignorance' is incapacity to discriminate between hight and low forms of conduct and principles, and also between what ought to be done and what ought not to be. These are the alities that are found in one born for a demoniac destiny. Asuras are those who rel against the ?ndments of the Lord.
16.4 See Coment under 16.5
16.4 O son of Prtha, dambhah, religious ostentation; darpah, pride arising from wealth, relatives, etc.; atimanah, haughtiness, as explained earlier; and krodhah, anger; eva ca, as also; parusyam, redeness, using unkind words, e.g. to speak of a blind person as having eyes, an ugly person as handsome, a lowly born man as born of aristocracy, and so on; and ajnanam, ignorance, non-discriminating knowledge, false conception regarding what ought to be and ought not to be done; are (the attributes) abhijatasya, of one destined to have;-destined for what? in answer the Lord says-asurim, demoniacal; sampadam, nature.
The conseences of these natures are being stated:
16.5 The divine nature is deemed conducive to liberation, and the demoniacal to bondage. Grieve not, O Arjuna, thou art born with divine endowments.
16.5 Godly qualities lead to liberation; godless to bondage. Do not be anxious, Prince! Thou hast the Godly qualities.
16.5. The divine wealth is meant for total emancipation  and the demoniac one is meant for complete bondage.  Grieve not, O son of Pandu.  For the divine wealth you are born
16.5  The divine destiny is deemed to lead to liberation, the demoniac to bondage. Grieve not, O Arjuna, you are born to a divine destiny.
16.5 The divine nature is the Liberation, the demoniacal is considered to be for inevitable bondage. Do not grieve, O son of Pandu! You are destined to have the divine nature.
16.5 'The divine destiny,' viz., which is of the nature of submission to My ?ndments aids liberation, viz., leads to release from bondage. The meaning is that it leads to the eventual attainment of Myself. 'The demoniac destiny' viz, which is of the nature of transgression of My ?ndments, is for bondage, i.e., takes one to degradation.

To Arjuna who, on hearing this, became alarmed and anxious about the classfication of his own nature, Sri Krsna said:

'Do not be grief-ridden. Surely, you are born for a divine destiny, O son of Pandu. The purport is that you have a divine destiny, since you are a son of Pandu who was most eminent among the righteous.
16.1-5 It has been stated  [at the end of the last chapter] that  'by understanding this' etc.  The thing called  'understanding' comes to be  [in  the following] manner :  After the knowledge, born from hearing  [the scriptures etc.],  there arises a thought-process consisting of the logical analysis,  deliberation and  deep meditation that take the form 'This (what is taught in the scriptures etc.)  is like this'.  The above thought-process is of the nature  of investigation, critical examination and judgement.  From this thought-process one gains a good knowledge of a well practised from i.e., a contemplation of that object, free from the humiliation (influence) of different category.  When this is gained, understanding is achieved  Hence, it will be declared :
 'By critically examining in this way fully, act as you please'.  (Ch. XVIII, 63).
 
Here, only the preceptor and the scripture are mainly capable of creating the scriptural knowledge.  But in producing reasoning, deliberation and meditation the main cause is the capacity to examine critically a thing and  it is a special attribute of the pupil and it is an important one.  Therefore, with an idea that this is in Arjuna and with an intention to add a preparatory note to the purposeful statement  'By critically examining this, [act as you please]'; the Bhagavat, the preceptor, says  'Fearlessness etc.'
 
The Ignorance, born of the Tamas (Stand) occupies the devilish side.  This is repelled  (or removed) by the well augmented wisdom that takes hold of the divine part.  This is the nature of things [under estion]  'You  (Arjuna) have taken refuge in the divine part viz., wisdom, born of the Sattva (Strand).  Therefore shirking off the internal Ignorance in the nature of delusion, you should undertake the action, that has the sanction of the scriptures and that is of the nature of eradicating the external foe having the form of ignorance.'  Thus commences the [present] chapter.  Hence -
 Abhayam etc., upto pandava.  These are the identification marks of a person of divine parts.  [Hence] they are clearly identified.  Self-restraint :  subduing the sense organs.  Thought-lessness :  the perfarmance of action without examining the antecedent and the seel; its absence is the absence of thought-lessness.  Vital power :  the act of casting away [all] limitations by taking hold energy in the Self.  [All] this is the divine wealth and this is for your total emancipation, as it destroys craving.  Therefore, don't get sorrow like 'Having killed brothers etc., how can I (Arjuna) enjoy pleasure ?'  [The idea of] the rest  [of passage] is clear.
16.5 That which is daivi, divine; sampad, nature; is vimoksaya, for Liberation from the bondage of the world. The asuri, demoniacal nature; mata, is considered to be; nibandhaya, for inevitable bondage. So also is the fiendish nature.
Now, when such a statement was made, the Lord, noticing Arjuna having this kind of inner cogitation-'Am I endowed with the demoniacal nature, or am I endowed with the divine nature?'-, says: ma, do not; sacah, grieve, O son of Pandu! Asi, you are; abhijatah, destined to have, born with the good fortune of having; daivim, the divine; sampadam, nature; i.e., you are destined for an illustrious future.
16.6 There are two types of beings in this world, the divine and the demoniacal; the divine has been described at length; hear from Me, O Arjuna, of the demoniacal.
16.6 All beings are of two classes: Godly and godless. The Godly I have described; I will now describe the other.
16.6. There are two types of  creations of beings in this world  [viz.]  the divine and also the demoniac.  The divine one has been properly described in detail; hear [now] the demoniac one from Me, O son of Prtha !
16.6  There are two types of beings in this world - the divine and the demoniac. The divine has been described at length. Hear from Me, O Arjuna, about the demoniac.
16.6 In this world there are are two (kinds of) creation of beings: the divine and the demoniacal. The divine has been spoken of elaborately. Hear about the demoniacal from Me, O son of Prtha.
16.6 In this world of works, there are 'two tpyes' of created beings who perform actions, viz., the divine and demoniac. Creation is production. By the force of old Karma of the nature of good and evil deeds, beings are born, divided into two kinds at their very birth for working out the ?ndments of the Lord or act contrary to them. Such is the meaning. Of these, the divine destiny has been told at length. For the purpose of working out their destiny in accordance with the mode of conduct, the creation of the godly, viz., of those devoted to My ?ndments, occurs; that mode of condut, composed of Karma-jnana-and-Bhakti-Yogas has been described at length. To follow what conducts leads to the creation of demons - listen about that conduct.
16.6 Dvau etc.  This divine wealth has been described  [by the passage]  'Fearlessness' etc.										
 Now the demoniac [wealth],  He describes :
16.6 Dvau, two, in number; are the (kinds of) bhuta-sargau, creation of beings, of men. Sarga is derived from srj in the sense of that which is created. The persons themselves, who are created with the natures of gods and demons, are being spoken of as 'two creations of beings', which accords with the Upanisadic text, 'There were two classes of Prajapati's sons, the gods and the demons' (Br. 1.3.1). For, asmin, in this; loke, world, all (persons) can rationally be divided into two classes. Which are those two creations of beings? The answer is, the two are the daiva, divine; eva ca, and; the asura, the demoniacal which are being discussed.
The Lord speaks of the need of restating the two that have been already referred to: Daivah, the divine creation of beings; proktah, has been spoken of; vistarasah, elaborately-in, 'Fearlessness, purity of mind,' etc. (1-3). But the demoniacal has not been spoken of in extenso. Hence, O son of Prtha, srnu, hear of, understand; the asuram, demoniacal; me, from Me, from My speech which is being uttered in detail, so that this may be avoided.
Upto the end of the chapter the demoniacal nature is being presented as the alities of creatures; for, when this is directly perceived, it becomes possible to eschew it:
16.7 The demoniacal know not what to do and what to refrain from; neither purity, nor right conduct nor truth is found in them.
16.7 The godless do not know how to act or how to renounce. They have neither purity nor truth. They do not understand the right principles of conduct.
16.7. The demoniac men do not know the origin and the withdrawal; neither purity, nor good conduct, nor truth does exist in them.
16.7  The demoniac men know neither action nor renunciation. Cleanliness is not in them, nor even right conduct, nor truth.
16.7 Neither do the demoniacal persons under-stand what is to be done and what is not to be done; nor does purity, or even good conduct or truthfulness exist in them.
16.7 The demoniac men do not know the 'path of action and renunciation,' viz., the Vedic Dharma that leads to prosperity and final release. 'Cleanliness' is the competence for performing Vedic rites as established in the Sastras. That 'cleanliness,' be it external or internal, is alien to the demoniac. Nor 'right conduct,' viz., that right conduct such as twilight prayers (Sandhya-vandana) etc., by means of which this internal and external cleanliness arises - even that right conduct is alien to them. For it is declared in:  'He who does not perform twilight prayers, is always unholy and is unfit for any rites' (Daksha Sm., 2.23). Likewise, 'truth' is not found among them, viz., that truthful speech, which is conducive to the welfare of beings and which is in accordance with one's actual knowledge, does not characterise them.

Moreover:
16.7 Pravrttim etc.  Origin :  i.e. wherefrom this  [universe] is born.  Withdrawal : i.e. into what  this gets dissolved.
16.7 Na, niether; do the asurah, demoniacal; janah, persons; viduh, understand; pravritim, what is to be done with regard to that which is a means to the human ends; and nivirttim, what is not to be done, the opposite of that (former) and from which source of evil one should desist. Nor only do they not know what is to be done and what is not to be done, na, nor; does saucam, purity; na api, or even; acarah, good conduct; or satyam, truthfulness; vidyate, exist; tesu, in them. The demons are verily bereft of purity and good conduct; they are deceitful and given to speaking lies.
Further,
16.8 They say, "This universe is without truth, without (moral) basis, without a God, brought about by mutual union, with lust for its cause; what else?"
16.8 They say the universe is an accident with no purpose and no God. Life is created by sexual union, a product of lust and nothing else.
16.8. They say that this world is without truth; has no basis; and has no Lord; this is born not on the basis of the mutual cause-and-effect-relation  [of the things]; it has nothing [beyond] and has no cause.
16.8 They maintain:  'The universe is without truth, without any foundation and without a Lord (Isvara). What else can exist without mutual causation?  It has lust for its cause.'
16.8 They say that the world is unreal, it has no basis, it is without a God. It is born of mutual union brought about by passion! What other (cause can there be)?
16.8 They maintain that the universe is 'without truth,' viz., they do not accept that this universe, which is the effect of Brahman denoted by the term Satya, has Brahman for its Self. They contend that it is bereft of any 'foundation,' viz., they do not accept that it has Brahman for its foundation. Brahman as Ananta supports the earth and bears all the worlds, as declared in 'This earth, sustained upon the head of this great serpent, supports in its turn, this garland of worlds, along with their men, demons and gods' (V.P., 2.5.27). They say that it is 'without a Lord,' viz. they don't accept that this universe is controlled by Me, the Lord of all, the Supreme Brahman, whose will is always true. It has been already averred:  'I am the origin of all; from Me proceed everything' (10.8). And they also contend thus:  'What else can exist without mutual causation?'  i.e., except by the union of the male and the female among men, beasts etc. What else exists apart from this nature?  The meaning is that nothing else is seen. Therefore the entire world is rooted in sexual lust.
16.8 Asatyam etc.  [It] has nothing beyond :  Here there is no other thing beyond what is seen.
16.8 Te, they, the domoniacal persons; ahuh, say; that the jagat, world; is asatyam, unreal-as we ourselves are prone to falsehood, so is this whole world unreal; apratistham, it has no basis, it does not have righteousness and unrighteousness as its basis; it is anisvaram, without a God-nor is there a God who rules this (world) according to rigtheousness and unrighteousness (of beings). Hence they say that the world is godless. Moreover, it is aparaspara-sambhutam, born of mutual union. The whole world is born of the union of the male and female impelled by passion. (That union is) kama-haitukam, brought about by passion. Kama-haitukam and kama-hetukam are the same. Kim anyat, what other (cause can there be)? There exists to other unseen cause such as righteousness, unrigtheousness, etc. Certainly, the passion of living beings is the cause of the world. This is the view of the materialists.
16.9 Holding this view, these ruined souls of small intellect and fierce deeds, come forth as the enemies of the world for its destruction.
16.9 Thinking thus, these degraded souls, these enemies of mankind - whose intelligence is negligible and whose deeds are monstrous - come into the world only to destroy.
16.9. Clinging to this view, the inauspcious men of the ruined Souls, of the poor intellect, and of the cruel deeds, strive for the destruction of the world.
16.9 Holding this view, these men of lost souls and fele understanding do cruel deeds for the destruction of the world.
16.9 Holding on to this view, (these people) who are of depraved character, of poor intellect, given to fearful actions and harmful, wax strong for the ruin of the world.
16.9 Holding this view, viz., supporting this view, these men of lost souls do not realise that the self is different from the body. They are of 'fele understanding,' they lack the discernment that the self is to be known as different from the body, because of Its being the knower in the body which is an object of knowledge such as jars etc. These are of 'cruel deeds' viz., they do much harm to everybody; they are born to bring ruin to the world.
16.9 See Coment under 16.12
16.9 Avastabhya, holding on to; etam, this; drstim, view; (these people) who are nasta-atmanah, of depraved character, who have deviated from the disciplines leading to the other world; alpa-budhayah, of poor intellect, whose intellect is indeed limited, engrossed with material things; ugra-kamanah, given to fearful actions-who are cruel by nature; and ahitah, harmful; i.e. inimical to the world; prabhavanti, wax strong; ksayaya, for the ruin; jagatah, of the world. This is the construction.
17.1 Arjuna said  Those who, setting aside the ordinances of the scriptures, perform sacrifice with faith, what is their condition, O Krishna? Is is Sattva, Rajas or Tamas?
17.1 "Arjuna asked: My Lord! Those who do acts of sacrifice, not according to the scriptures but nevertheless with implicit faith, what is their condition? Is it one of Purity, of Passion or of Ignorance?
17.1. Arjuna said  Those who remain with faith, but neglecting the scriptural injunction, - what is their state ?  Is it Sattva, Rajas or Tamas ?  O Krsna !
17.1 Arjuna said  Now what, O Krsna, is the position or basis of those who leave aside the injunction of the Sastra, yet worship with faith?  Is it Sattva, Rajas or Tamas?
17.1 Arjuna said  But, ['But' is used to present a standpoint distinct from the earlier ones understand from 16.23-4.-S.] O Krsna, what is the state [i.e., where do the rites undertaken by them end?] of those who, endued with faith, adore [Adore-perform sacrifices, distribute wealth etc. in honour of gods and others.] by ignoring the injunctions of the scriptures? Is it sattva, rajas or tamas?
17.1 Arjuna said  Those who, 'filled with faith but laying aside the injunctions of the Sastras,' engage themselves in sacrifices etc., what is their 'position or basis'?  It is Sattva, Rajas or Tamas?  Nistha means Sthiti. What is called Sthiti is that state in which one abides, has one's position or basis. Do they abide in Sattva, in Rajas or in Tamas?  Such is the meaning of the estion.

Thus estioned, the Lord, for affirming the futility of faith and of sacrifices not enjoined in the Sastras, and in order to show that the triple division in accordance with the Gunas refers only to sacrifices etc., enjoined in the Sastras - expounds here the threefold nature of faith enjoined in the Sastras:
17.1 Ye  sastra - etc.  The estion is this :  What is the goal  [to be reached]  by those persons who faithfully perform their worldly actions by not adhering to the scripural injunction ?								
 Now in this regard the answer, basing on the faith, is given by the Bhagavat -
17.1 Tu, but; of Krsna, ka, what; is the nistha, state; tesam, of those-whosoever they may be; ye, who; being anvitah, endued; sraddhaya, with faith, with the idea that there is something hereafter; yajante, adore gods and others; utsriya, by ignoring, setting aside; sastra-vidhim, the unjunctions of the scriptures, the injunctions of the Vedas and the Smrtis? Is the state of those who are such sattvam, sattva; aho, or; rajah, rajas; or tamah, tamas? This is what is meant: Does the adoration of gods and others that they undertake come under the category of sattva or rajas or tamas?
By 'those who, endued with faith, adore by ignoring the injunctions of the scriptures' are here meant those who, not finding any injunction which can be characterized as 'enjoined by the Vedas' 'or enjoined by the Smrtis', worship gods and others by merely observing the conduct of their elders. But, on the other hand, those who, though aware of some scriptural injunction, discard them and worship the gods and others in ways contrary to the injunctions, are not meant here by 'those who, ignoring scriptural injunctions, adore৷৷.'
Why?
Because of the alifying phrase, 'being endued with faith'. For, it cannot be imagined that even when they are aware of some scriptural injunction about worship of gods and others, they discard this out of their faithlessness, and yet they engage in the worship of gods and others enjoined by those scriptures by becoming imbued with faith! Therefore, by 'those who, endued with faith, adore by ignoring the injunctions of the scriptures' are here meant those very ones mentioned earlier.
An answer to this estion relating to a general topic cannot be given without splitting it up. Hence,-
17.10 That which is state, tasteless, putrid, rotten, refuse and impure, is the food liked by the Tamasic.
17.10 The Ignorant love food which is stale, not nourishing, putrid and corrupt, the leavings of others and unclean.
17.10. What is old, bereft of taste, ill-smelling, and stale; what is also left after eating, and is impure - such a food is dear to the men of the Tamas (Strand).
17.10 That food which is stale, tasteless, putrid, decayed, refuse, unclean, is dear to Tamasika men.
17.10 Food which is not properly cooked, lacking in essence, putrid and stale, and even ort and that which is unfit for sacrifice, is dear to one possessed of tamas.
17.10 Stale (Yatayamam) means that food which has lost its original state, being kept for a long time. Tasteless (Gatarasam) means that which has lost its natural taste. Putrid (Puti) means emitting a bad smell. Decayed (Paryusitam) means aciring a rancidity by lapse of time. Refuse (Ucchistam) means the food that has remained over after being partaken by persons other than Gurus, etc. Unclean (Amedhyam) is that which is not fit for offering in sacrifice or worship. The meaning is that, being unfit for offering in worship, they cannot become the sacrificial remainder. Foods of this kind which promote the growth of Tamas are dear to those who are characterised by Tamas. Food (Bhojana) means that which is eaten. Tamasik food promotes further increase of Tamas. Hence, those persons who care for their own welfare by the growth of Sattva, should eat food charaterised by Sattva.
17.7-10 Aharah etc. upto tamasapriyam.  What is old :  that for which [three] yamas have elapsed [after cooking].
17.10 Bhojanam, food; which is yata-yamam, not properly cooked [Yata-yamam lit. means 'crooked three hours ago', that which has lost its essence; but here it is translated as 'not properly cooked to avoid tautology, for the next word gata-rasam, too, means lacking in essence.-Tr.] (-because food that has lost its essence is referred to by the word gatarasam-); gata-rasam, lacking in essence; puti, putrid; and paryusitam, stale, cooked on the previous day and kept over-night; and even ucchistam, ort, remnants of a meal; and amedhyam, that which is unfit for sacrifice;- this kind of food is tamasa-priyam, dear to one possessed of tamas.
Now then, sacrifices of three kinds are being stated:
17.11 That sacrifice which is offered by men without desire for reward as enjoined by the ordinance (scripture), with a firm faith that to do so is a duty, is Sattvic or pure.
17.11 Sacrifice is Pure when it is offered by one who does not covet the fruit thereof, when it is done according to the commands of scripture, and with implicit faith that the sacrifice is a duty.
17.11. That sacrifice is of the Sattva (Strand), which is offered, as found in the injunction, by men craving for no fruit, by stabilizing their mind with the thought that it is just a thing to be offered.
17.11 The sacrifice (worship) marked by Sattva is what is offered by those desiring no fruit, and having the conviction that it should be performed as enjoined in the Sastras.
17.11 That sacrifice which is in accordance with the injunctions, (and is) performed by persons who do not hanker after results, and with the mental conviction that it is surely obligatory, is done through sattva.
17.11 That sacrifice is marked by Sattva which is offered by those desiring no fruits, with the 'conviction', i.e., with the idea that it ought to be performed or that it should be offered for its own sake as worship of the Lord as enjoined in the injunctions of the Sastras, i.e., with hymns, right materials and proper rituals.
17.11 See Comment under 17.13
17.11 Sah, that; yajnah, sacrifice; vidhi-drstah, which is in accordance with the injunctions, which is known through scriptural unjunctions; (and) yah, which; is ijyate, performed; a-phala-akanksibhih, by persons who do not hanker after results; manah samadhaya, with the mental conviction; iti, that; yastavyam, eva, it is surely obligatory, their duty is to accomplish the sacrifice just as it should be-with the firm idea, 'I have no human goal to achieve through this'-; is said to be a sacrifice which is sattvikah, done through sattva.
17.12 The sacrifice which is offered, O Arjuna, seeking a reward and for ostentation, know thou that to be a Rajasic Yajna.
17.12 Sacrifice which is performed for the sake of its results, or for self-glorification - that, O best of Aryans, is the product of Passion.
17.12. What is offered aiming at fruit and also only for the sake of display-know that sacrifice to be of the Rajas (Strand) and to be transitary and  impermanent.
17.12 But that sacrifice which is offered with the fruit in view and for the sake of ostentation, know it, O Arjuna, to be Rajasika.
17.12 But that sacrifice which is performed having in veiw a result, as also for ostentation,-know that sacrifice to be done through rajas, O greatest among the descendants of Bharata.
17.12 That sacrifice, performed to gain fruits, full of ostentation and with fame as its aim, know that sacrifice to be characterised by Rajas.
17.12 See Comment under 17.13
17.12 Tu, but; yat, that which; is ijyate, performed; abhisandhaya, having in view; a phalam, result; api ca, as also; dambhartham, for ostentation; viddhi, know; tam, that; yajnam, sacrifice; to be rajasam, done through rajas; bharatasrestha, O greatest among the descendants of Bharata.
17.13 They declare that sacrifice to be Tamasic which is contrary to the ordinances of the scriptures, in which no food is distributed, which is devoid of Mantras, gifts and faith.
17.13 Sacrifice that is contrary to scriptural command, that is unaccompanied by prayers or gifts of food or money, and is without faith - that is the product of Ignorance.
17.13. That sacrifice they declare to be of the Tamas (Strand) which is devoid of scriptural injunction, in which there is no [recitation of]  Vedic hymns, where no food and [sacrifical]  fee are distributed, and which is totally devoid of faith.
17.13 That sacrifice which is bereft of authority, which uses offerings not sanctioned by the Sastras, which is performed without recitation of hymns and bereft of gifts and faith - that, they say, is marked by Tamas.
17.13 They declare that sacrifice as 'done through tamas' which is contrary to injunction, in which food is not distributed, in which mantras are not used, in which offerings are not made to priests, and which is devoid of faith.
17.13 They say that sacrifice is Tamasa, which is bereft of the authority of injunction of Brahmanas of learning and good conduct as 'Do this sacrifice,' which is 'Asrstanna' viz., which uses offerings (materials) not sanctioned by the Sastras; which is performed without recitation of hymns; and which is bereft of gifts and faith.

Now, to explain the threefold division of austerities according to their source in the Gunas, Sri Krsna describes their differences in respect of the body, speech and mind:
17.11-13 Aphala-etc. upto paricaksate. Stabilizing mind :  by firmly believing.  Also for the sake of display etc.  Display : an intention  'Let the world take me to be of  this natrue'.  That which is devoid of scriptural injunction :  that which is devoid of rituals prescribed in the scriptures.  The same [feature] is elaborated by the attributives  'That in which no food is distributed' etc.
17.13 Paricaksate, they delclare; that yajnam, sacrifice; as tamasam, done through tamas; which is vidhi-hinam, contrary to injunction, opposed to what is enjoined; asrstannam, in which food is not distributed-a sacrifice in which food (annam) is not distributed (asrstam) to Brahmanas; mantra-hinam, in which mantras are not used, which is bereft of mantras, intonation and distinct pronunciation; adaksinam, in which offerings are not made to priests as prescribed; and which is sraddha-virahitam, devoid of faith.
After that, now is being stated the three kinds of austerity:
17.14 Worship of the gods, the twice-born, the teachers and the wise, purity, straightforwardness, celibacy and non-injury are called the austerities of the body.
17.14 Worship of God and the Master; respect for the preacher and the philosopher; purity, rectitude, continence and harmlessness - all this is physical austerity.
17.14. The worship to the gods, to the twice-born, to the elders and to the wise; the purity, the honesty, the state of continence, and the harmlessness-all this is said to be bodily austerity.
17.14 Worship of the gods, the twice-born, the preceptors, the enlightened ones, purity, uprightness, continence and non-injury, these are called austerity of the body.
17.14 The worship of gods, twice-borns, venerable persons and the wise; purity, straightforwardness, celibacy and non-injury,-are said to be bodily austerity.
17.14 The worship of the gods, the twice-born, preceptors and enlightened ones; purity, viz., by ablutions in sacred water; uprightness, viz., bodily action in accordance with the mind; continence, viz., absence of looking at women etc., considering them as objcts of pleasure; non-injury, viz., not hurting any being - these constitute the austerity of the body.
17.14 See Comment under 17.16
17.14 Deva-dvija-guru-pujanam, the worship of gods, twice-borns, venerable persons and the wise; saucam, purity; arjavam, straightforwardness; brahmacarayam, celibacy; and ahimsa, non-injury; ucyate, are said to be; sariram, bodily; tapah, austerity, austerity accomplished through the body: that which can be performed by the agent, etc. [See 18. 13-15.-Tr.], (i.e.) with the whole group of body and organs, in which the body predominates; for the Lord will say, 'these five are its causes' (18.15).
17.15 Speech which causes no excitement, truthful, pleasant and beneficial, the practice of the study of the Vedas, are called austerity of speech.
17.15 Speech that hurts no one, that is true, is pleasant to listen to and beneficial, and the constant study of the scriptures - this is austerity in speech.
17.15. The unoffending speech which is true, and which is pleasant and beneficial;  and also the practice of regular recitation of the Vedas - all this is said to be an austerity by the speech-sense.
17.15 Speech that causes no shock (hurt and fear etc.) and which is true, pleasant and beneficial, and also the practice of recitation of the scriptures are called the austerity of speech.
17.15 That speech which causes no pain, which is true, agreeable and beneficial; as well as the practice of study of the scriptures,-is said to be austerity of speech.
17.15 Verbal austerity consists in using words that do not hurt others, are true, are pleasing and are beneficial. It also involves studying scriptural texts.
17.15 See Comment under 17.16
17.15 Yat, that; vakyam, speech; anudvegakaram, which causes no pain, which is not hurtful to creatures which is satyam, true; priya-hitam, agreeable and beneficial with regard to facts seen or unseen-.
'Speech' is alified by characteristics such as being not hurtful, etc. The ca (and) is used for grouping together the alifying characteristics. When a sentence is used in order to make another understand, if it happens to be avoid of one or two or three among the alities-truthfulness, agreeability, beneficialness, and non-hurtfulness-, then it is not austerity of speech.
As in the case of a truthful utterance there would occur a want of austerity of speech if it be lacking in one or two or three of the others, so also in the case of an agreeable utterance there would be no austerity of speech were it ot be without one or two or three of the others; and similarly, there would be no austerity of speech even in a beneficial utterance which is without one or two or three of the others.
What, again, is that austerity (of speech)? That utterance which is true as also not hurtful, and is agreeable and beneficial, is the highest austerity of speech: As for example, the utterance, 'Be calm, my boy. Practise study and yoga. Thery you will gain the highest.'
Svadhyaya-abhyasanam, the practice of the study of scriptures, as is enjoined; ca eva, as well; ucyate, in said to be; tapah, austerity; vanmayam, of speech.
17.16 Serenity of mind, good-heartedness, self-control, purity of nature  this is called mental austerity.
17.16 Serenity, kindness, silence, self-control and purity - this is austerity of mind.
17.16. The serenity of mind, the ietness, the taciturnity, the self-control, the purity of thought-all this is called mental austerity.
17.16 Serenity of mind, benevolence, silence, self-control, purity of mind - these are called austerity of the mind.
17.16 Tranillity of mind, gentleness, reticence, withdrawal of the mind, purity of heart,-these are what is called mental austerity.
17.16 Serenity of mind, viz., absence of wrath etc., practice of benevolence, viz., the direction of the mind for the good of others, silence, viz., contorl of speech by the mind; self-control, viz., focusing the activity of the mind on the object of contemplation; purity of mind, viz., absence of thought about subjects other than the self - these constitute the austerity of the mind.
17.14-16 Deva - etc.  upto manasam ucyate :  Honesty :  uprightness, i.e.,  the courage regarding what needs no hiding.  Which is true :  This is explained by 'Which is pleasant and beneficial'.  Pleasant : at the time of [hearing]  that speech.  And beneficial :  something in future.  This type of speech, but not merely speaking what actually happened, is called  'speaking the truth'.  Purity of thought :  'Thought'  denotes intention; its highest purity.
17.16 Manah-prasadah, tranillity of mind, making the mind free from anxiety; saumyatvam, gentleness-that which is called kindliness of spirit, [Kindliness towards all, and also not entertaining any evil thought towards anybody.] a certain condition of the mind resulting in calmness of the face, etc.; maunam, reticence-since even the control of speech follows from the control of mind, therefore the cause is implied by the effect; so maunam means control of the mind; [Or, maunam may mean thinking of the Self, the attitude of a meditator. The context being of 'mental austerity', reticence is explained as control of the mind with regard to speech.] atma-vinigrahah, withdrawal of the mind-withdrawal of the mind in a general way, from everything; maunam (control of the mind) is the mind's withdrawal with regard to speech alone; this is the distinction-; bhava-samsuddhih, purity of heart, absence of trickery while dealing with others; iti etat, these are; what is ucyate, called; manasam, mental; tapah, austerity.
How the above-described bodily, verbal and mental austerities undertaken by poeple are divided into three classes-of sattva etc.-is being stated:
17.17 This threefold austerity, practised by steadfast men, with the utmost faith, desiring no reward, they call Sattvic.
17.17 These threefold austerities performed with faith, and without thought of reward, may truly be accounted Pure.
17.17. This three-fold austerity, undertaken (observed) with best faith, by  men who are maters of Yoga and have no desire for its fruits-they call it to be of the Sattva.
17.17 The threefold austerity, practised with supreme faith by men who desire no fruit and are devoted - they call it austerity of Sattva.
17.17 When that threefold austerity is undertaken with supreme faith by people who do not hanker after results and are self-controlled, they speak of it as born of sattva.
17.17 The threefold austerity practised with supreme faith through the body, speech and mind by men who have no thoughts of any reward and who are devoted, viz., are imbued with the thought that it is the worship of the Supreme Person, they call such austerity as Sattvika.
17.17 See Comment under 17.19
17.17 When tat, that; trividham, threefold-based on three factors; tapah, austerity, which is being discussed; is taptam, undertaken, practised; paraya, with supreme, with the highest; sraddhaya, faith, belief in God and the other world; naraih, by people, by its performers; aphala-akanksibhih, who do not hanker after results,who are devoid of desire for results; and yuktaih, who are self-controlled;-that austerity which is of this kind, the noble people paricaksate, speak of it; as sattvikam, born of sattva.
17.18 The austerity which is practised with the object of gaining good reception, honour and worship, and with hypocrisy, is here said to be Rajasic, unstable and transitory.
17.18 Austerity coupled with hypocrisy or performed for the sake of self-glorification, popularity or vanity, comes from Passion, and its result is always doubtful and temporary.
17.18. The austerity that is practised for gaining respect, honour and reverence and with sheer showing-that is called here [austerity] of the Rajas and it is unstable and impermanent.
17.18 That austerity, pracitsed with ostentation for the sake of gaininng respect, praise and reverence, is here said to be Rajasa. It is unsteady and impermanent.
17.18 That austerity which is undertaken for earning a name, being honoured and worshipped, and also ostentatiously,-that is spoken of as born of rajas, belonging to this world, uncertain and transitory.
17.18 'Respect' means recognition by others. 'Praise' means verbal adulation. 'Reverence' means corporeal actions such as prostration etc. That austerity, practised with expectation of rewards like respect, etc., mentioned above - it is here said to be Rajasa. It is unsteady and impermanent, because of the temporary nature of its rewards like heaven etc.; 'unsteadiness' is the result of the fear of falling. 'Impermanent' means the tendency to perish.
17.18 See Comment under 17.19
17.18 Yat, that; tapah, austerity; which is kriyate, undertaken; satkara-mana-pujartham, for earning a name, being honoured and worshipped-for earning a name, (i.e.) for being spoken of thus: 'This Brahmana, who is given to austerity, is pious'; for being honoured by (others') standing up respectfully, salutation, etc.; for being worshipped with washing of feet, adoration, feeding, etc.; for these-; ca eva, and also, (that) austerity which is performed dambhena, ostentatiously; tat, that; proktam, is spoken of; as rajasam, born of rajas; iha, belonging to this world; [i.e. yielding fruits only in this world.] calam, uncertain-its result being unpredictable; and adhruvam, transitory.
17.19 That austerity which is practised out of a foolish notion, with self-torture, or for the purpose of destroying another, is declared to be Tamasic.
17.19 Austerity done under delusion, and accompanied with sorcery or torture to oneself or another, may be assumed to spring from Ignorance.
17.19. What austerity is practised with foolish obstinacy  [and] with self-torture only in order to destroy other person-that is declared to be of the Tamas.
17.19 That austerity which is practised from deluded notions by means of self-torture or in order to injure another is said to be Tamasika.
17.19 That austerity which is undertaken with a foolish intent, by causing pain to oneself, or for the destruction of others-that is said to be born of tamas.
17.19 Deluded persons are those who lack correct understanding. That austerity which is practised from deluded notion, viz., from the obstinate determination by deluded persons, by self-torture regardless of one's own capacity or which is performed for causing sufferings to others - that is said to be Tamasika.
17.17-19 Sraddhaya etc. upto tamasam udahrtam.  There is faith in all the three-fold austerity.  the faith of a man of the Sattva is full of austerity itself.  The faith of a man of the Rajas is in the Rajas i.e, showing  (or hyprocricy) etc.  But, the faith (or desire) of a man well established in the Tamas  is merely in ruining others.  Thus the sage speaks of all the three-fold austerity practised with faith.
17.19 Yat, that; tapah, austerity; which is kriyate, under-taken; mudha-grahena, with a foolish intent, with a conviction arising out of non-discriminating; pidaya, causing pain; atmanah, to oneself (to one's body etc.); va, or; utsadanartham, for the destruction; parasya, of another; tat, that; is udahrtam, said to be; an austerity tamasam, born of tamas.
Now the classification of charity is being spoken of:
17.2 The Blessed Lord said  Threefold is the faith of the embodied, which is inherent in their nature  the Sattvic (pure), the Rajasic (passionate) and the Tamasic (dark). Do thou hear of it.
17.2 Lord Shri Krishna replied: Man has an inherent faith in one or another of the Qualities -Purity, Passion and Ignorance. Now listen.
17.2. The Bhagavat said  The faith of the embodied persons is born of their nature and is of three kinds [viz৷৷]  that which is made of the Sattva ;  that which is made of the Rajas ;  and that which is made of the Tamas.  Listen about them.
17.2 The Lord said  Threefold is the faith of embodied beings, born of their own nature, constituted of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Listen now about it.
17.2 The Blessed Lord said  That faith of the embodied beings, born of their own nature, is threefold-born of sattva, rajas and tamas. Hear about it.
17.2 The Lord said  'Threefold is the faith among all' embodied beings. And it arises from their 'inborn nature.' What is called Svabhava is the state unie to one's own nature. It is the special taste or predilection caused by previous subtle impressions, 'Vasanas.' To whatever one's predilection is directed, there faith is born in respect of it. For 'faith' is zeal or eagerness about any means in the belief that it is the way of action to achieve one's own desired object. Vasana (subtle impression), Ruci (taste) and Sraddha (faith) are the alities of the self born from its association with the Gunas. The Sattva and the other Gunas are the alities of the body, the senses, the internal organs and sense-objects. They bring about their alities in the self associated with them. These are the Vasanas. These Gunas can be described only by their effects. These (i.e., Vasanas etc.) originate from experiences with the body etc., having origination in Sattva and other Gunas. Thus faith is threefold as marked by Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Listen about this faith.
17.2 Trividha etc.  Here the ideas is this :-  What is termed scripture is indeed the one which is not created by the intellect soiled by any partisan spirit;  further it is of the form of the firmness of the recollection;  and it is firmly recollected because of the sovereign freedom of the awareness;  likewise it is also of the nature of fruit etc., i.e. the nature of  the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate purport of speech, a flow of the pure Self-Consciousness; because of its free course, it starts from the internal nature of awareness and goes as for as the external flow,  beginning from the subtlest hymn (Om), down to the series of  popular saying well-known in the worldly activities.  'What [the sage] says -
 
'Also the [injunctions based on]  remembrance and the virtuous conduct of  the knowers of that [constitute authority]'.  (Gautamadharmasutra, I, 2).
 
That scripture, by its own nature, distinguishes what is to be done and what is not to be done, in order to teach what is beneficial and what is not beneficial.
 
[Further],  he whose heart is very tender by nature, because of the excess of  the Sattva (i.e., godness) - in whatever way he behaves, that has certainly a scriptural authority.  But other person who is made dirty by the Rajas or the Tamas  (i.e., desire and ignorance) does not act rightly, even while performing what is enjoined in the scriptures.  For, he does not follow  the purport (the spirit) of the scripture  in its entity.  The scripture (or what is enjoined in the scripture) bears fruits only in the case of men of the Sattva (goodness)  This has been declared by the scripture itself as :
 
'He  [alone]  enjoys the fruit of the scripture (or holy bathing place)  whose arms and feet and also mind, learning, austerity and conduct are controlled properly'.										(MB, Aranyaka, Ch. 80, verse 30).
 
Any other person does not enjoy  [the fruit], because the rmains unsubdued [in his mind].  Therefore, what is prescribed in the scripture bears fruit in the case of those who have abandoned desire, anger and delusion.  This is the purport of the present chapter; and it is being elaborated  [throughout].  But it is not explained  [in every  place by us (Ag.), because the idea is clear enough.  But [the concerned verses] are simply written only to remove doubts regarding the readings [of the passages concerned].
17.2 Sa, that; sraddha, faith, the state about which you ask; dehinam, of the embodied beings; svabhavaja, born of their own nature-by svabhava (nature) is meant that latent impression of virtuous acts etc. acired in the past lives, which becomes manifest at the time of death; what arises out of that is svabhavaja-; is trividha, threefold, of three kinds; sattviki, born of sattva, and related to worship of gods, etc.; rajasi, born of rajas, concerning worship of Yaksas (a class of demi-gods, Kubera and others), Raksas (ogres, Nairrti and others); and tamasi, born of tamas, concerning worship of ghosts, goblins and others. Thus it is of three kinds. Srnu, hear; tam, about it, that faith, as it is being stated.
That (faith) is threefold as follows:
17.20 That gift which is given to one who does nothing in return, knowing it to be a duty to give in a fit place and time to a worthy person, that gift is held to be Sattvic.
17.20 The gift which is given without thought of recompense, in the belief that it ought to be made, in a fit place, at an opportune time and to a deserving person - such a gift is Pure.
17.20. A gift which is given with the thought  that  'One must give'  and is given in a proper place, and at correct  time to a worthy person, incapable of obliging in return-that gift is held to be of the Sattva.
17.20 Gifts given with the feeling, that it is one's own duty to give to one who makes no return, at the proper place and time to the deserving person - that is said to be Sattvika.
17.20 That gift is referred to as born of sattva which gift is given with the idea that it ought to be given, to one who will not serve in return, and at the (proper) place, (proper) time and to a (proper) person.
17.20 Gifts given without thought of return of favours and with the feelings, 'These gifts must be given,' at the proper places and time to a worthy person who makes no return - such gifts are said to be Sattvika.
17.20 See Comment under 17.22
17.20 Tat, that; danam, gift; is smrtam, referred to; as sattvikam, born of sattva; yat, which gift; is diyate, given; with the idea in mind datavyam iti, that it ought to be given without consideration; anupakarine, to one who will not serve in return, and even to oen who can; and dese, at the (proper) place-in holy places like Kuruksetra etc. ; kale, at the (proper) time-during Sankranti [During the passage of the sun or any planetary body from one zodiacal sign into another.-V.S.A.] etc.; and patre, to a (proper) person-to one who is versed in the Vedas together with their six branches, and such others.
17.21 And, that gift which is given with a view to receive something in return, or looking for a reward, or reluctantly, is held to be Rajasic.
17.21 That which is given for the sake of the results it will produce, or with the hope of recompense,or grudgingly - that may truly be said to be the outcome of Passion.
17.21. But, what is given to get a return of favour or again with a view to a fruit, and which is very much vexed - that gift is held to be of the Rajas.
17.21 But that which is given as a consideration for something receievd or in expectation of future reward, or grudgingly, is called Rajasika gift.
17.21 But the gift which is given expecting reciprocation, or again, with a desire for its result, and which is given grudgingly,- that is considered to be born of rajas.
17.21 That gift which is given grudgingly, viz., gift of useless things with a sly expectation of something in return that is said to be gift of Rajasa nature.
17.21 See Comment under 17.22
17.21 Tu, but; the danam, gift; yat, which; diyate, is made; prati-upakara-artham, expecting reciprocation-with this purpose in view: 'In time, he will render service in return'-; va punah, or again; uddisya, with a desire for; its phalam, result-that, 'To me will accrue some unseen reward of this gift'-; and which is diyate, given; pariklistam, grudgingly, with reluctance; tat, that; is smrtam, considered to be; rajasam, born of rajas.
17.22 The gift that is given at a wrong place and time, to unworthy persons, without respect or with insult is declared to be Tamasic.
17.22 And that which is given at an unsuitable place or time or to one who is unworthy, or with disrespect or contempt - such a gift is the result of Ignorance.
17.22. The gift which is given, at a wrong place, at a wrong time and to unworthy persons; and which is converted into a bad act and is disrespected - that  is declared to be of the Tamas.
17.22 That gift which is given at the wrong place and wrong time to unworthy recipients, without due respect and with contempt, is called the gift of Tamasa nature.
17.22 The gift which is made at an improper place and time, and to undeserving persons, without proper treatment and with disdain, is declared to be born of tamas.
17.22 That gift which is given to unworthy recipients at wrong place and time, without due respect, viz., without showing such signs of respect as cleansing the feet; with contempt, viz., with disdain and without courtesy - that is said to be of Tamasa nature.

 So far, the divisions due to differences of Gunas in respect of sacrifices, austerities and gifts as enjoined by the Vedas have been portrayed. Now is given the definition of Vedic sacrifices etc., according to their association with Pranava (i.e., the syllable Om), and as signified by the terms Tat and Sat.
17.20-22 Datavyam etc. upto udahrtam.  With the thought that  'One must give' :  thinking that the [scriptural] injunction  'One must give' is to be obeyed in order to avoid sin.  Very much vexed : because of the fault of [giving] very little. A gift is converted into a bad one by offending its recipient, and so on.  Thus the activities of the worldly men are explained on the basis of their three-fold intentions born of the Sattva and so on.								
 How do those persons perform actions, whose intellect has gone beyond the region, that is impassable because of the triad of the Strands ?  Now that manner is described as -
17.22 Tat, that; danam, gift; yat, which; diyate, is given; adesakale, at an improper place and time-in an unholy place full of barbarians and impure things, etc.; at an improper time: which is not well known as productive of merit; without such specially as Sankranti etc.-; and apatrhyah, to undeserving persons, to fools, thieves and others;-and even when the place etc. are proper-asatkrtam, without proper treatment, without sweet words, washing of feet, worship, etc.; and avajnatam, with disdain, with insults to the recipient; is udahrtam, declared to be; tamasam, born of tamas.
This advice is being imparted for making sacrifices, gifts, austerities, etc. perfect:
17.23 "Om Tat Sat": This has been declared to be the triple designation of Brahman. By that were created formerly, the Brahmanas, the Vedas and the sacrifices.
17.23 Om Tat Sat' is the triple designation of the Eternal Spirit, by which of old the Vedic Scriptures, the ceremonials and the sacrifices were ordained.
17.23. OM  TAT  SAT :  This is held to be the three-fold indication of the Brahman.  By means of that, the Vedas, and also the sacrifices had been fashioned formerly by Brahma.
17.23 Om, Tat, Sat - thus Brahman is denoted by this threefold expression. Associated with these, Brahmanas, the Vedas and sacrifices were ordained in the past.
17.23 'Om-tat-sat' ['Om, That, Existence': 'Om iti brahma, Om is Brahman' (Tai. 1.8.1); 'Tattvamasi, Thou art That' (Ch. 6.8.7); and 'Sadeva somya idamagra asit, This was Existence alone in the beginning, O amiable one' (Ch. 6.2.1)-in these texts Brahman is indicated by the words Om, tat, sat.]-this is considered to be the threefold designation of Brahman. The Brahmanas and Vedas and the sacrifices were ordanined by that in the days of yore.
17.23 Here Brahman means the Veda. It is the secondary meaning of the expression, especially of the ritualistic portion of the Veda. The three-fold expression Om Tat Sat is connected with the Brahman  or the Veda. Sacrifices and similar rituals are prescribed in the Vedas. These expressions Om Tat Sat are used in these Vedic rites. The connection of Om is that it should be invariably used at the commencement of the recitation of Vedic hymns. The syllable Tat and Sat indicate that these rituals are worthy of honour. The Brahmanas are those who are to preserve Vedic study as also the Vedas and the sacrificial rites ordained in them. All these were created by Me in the past.

Sri Krsna elaborates in the next verses the nature of the connection of these syllables with the Vedic rituals, beginning first with Om.
17.23 See Comment under 17.27
17.23 Om, tat, sat-iti, this; is smrtah, considered, regarded, in the Vedanta, by the knowers of Brahman; to be the trividhah, threefold; nirdesah, designation, mention by name-nirdesa is that by which a thing is specified; brahmanah, of Brahman. The Brahmanas and the Vedas and the sacrifices were vihitah, ordainded, [When some defect arises in sacrifice etc., then this is corrected by uttering one of these words-Om, tat, sat.] created; tena, by that threefold designation; pura, in the days of yore [In the beginning of creation by Prajapati.]-this is said by way of eulogizing the designation.
17.24 Therefore, with the utterance of "Om" are the acts of sacrifice, gift and austerity as enjoined in the scriptures, always begun by the students of Brahman.
17.24 Therefore all acts of sacrifice, gifts and austerities, prescribed by the scriptures, are always begun by those who understand the Spirit with the word Om.
17.24. Therefore, the scripture-prescribed acts of sacrifice, gift and austerity of those who are habituated to have Brahman-discourses, commence (or take place) invariably, with the utterance of  OM.
17.24 Therefore, the Veda-enjoined sacrificial acts, gifts and austerity by these expounders of the Veda, or those belonging to the first three stations are always and at all times begun after pronouncing Om at the beginning.
17.24 Therefore, acts of sacrifice, charity and austerity as prescribed through injunctions, of those who study and expound the Vedas, always commence after uttering the syllable Om.
17.24 After pronouncing Om, the Vedas are recited. Thus the connection of the syllable Om with the Vedas and the rituals enjoined in the Vedas such as sacrifices has been described. As the Vedas are connected with the word Om, all belonging to the three stations of life who memorise the Vedas and perform the rituals inculcated in them, are included in the expression, 'expounders of the Vedas.'

Now, He describes the manner by which the word Tat is connected with them:
17.24 See Comment under 17.27
17.24 Tasmat, therefore; yajna-dana-tapah, kriyah, acts of sacrifice, charity and austerity-acts in the form of sacrifice etc.; vidhana-uktah, as prescribed through injunctions, as ordained by the scriptures; brahma-vadinam, of those who study and expound the Vedas; satatam, always; pravartante, commence; udahrtya, after uttering; om iti, the syllable Om.
17.25 Uttering ï1Tatï1, without aiming at the fruits, are the acts of sacrifice and austerity and the various acts of gifts performed by the seekers of liberation.
17.25 Those who desire deliverance begin their acts of sacrifice, austerity or gift with the word Tat' (meaning That'), without thought of reward.
17.25. With  [the utterance of]  TAT  and without aiming at the fruit, the acts of sacrifice and austerity and the various acts of gifts are performed by those who seek emancipation.
17.25 Acts of sacrifice, of austeritty and of various gifts are performed without aiming at reward by those who seek release, after pronouncing Tat.
17.25 After (uttering) the word tat, acts of sacrifice and austerity as also the various acts of charity are performed without regard for results by persons aspiring for Liberation.
17.25 Whatever acts such as the study of the Vedas, sacrifices, austerities and gifts are done without aiming at results by those of the first three stations, seeking only final release - these are designated by the term Tat referring to the brahman, since they constitute the means for attainment of brahman. For it is well known that the term Tat signifies brahman, as in the following passage:  He is Sah,Vah, Kah, Kim, Yat, Tat, Padam, Anuttamam.' (M.B., 13.254.91). Thus, the study of the Vedas, sacrifices etc., which are the means of attaining release, have been stated; the connection of Tat has been spoken of since the word Tat signifies them (i.e., the study of Vedas etc.). The connection of the term Tat with the three stations is shown because of their practising the study of the Vedas etc., in the way stated.

In order to show how the term Sat is connected with these, Sri Krsna shows the etymology of the term Sat, as it is prevalent in the world:
17.25 See Comment under 17.27
17.25 After uttering the word tat, which is a name of Brahman, yajna-tapah-kriyah, acts of sacrifice and austerity; ca, as also; vividhah, the various; dana-kriyah, acts of charity, such as gift of land, gold, etc.; kriyante, are performed; anabhisandhaya, without regard for; phalam, results of actions; moksa-kanksibhih, by persons aspiring for Liberation.
The use of the words Om and tat has been stated. Thereafter, the use of the word sat is bieng presently stated:
17.26 The word ï1Satï1 is used in the sense of reality and of goodness; and so also, O Arjuna, the word ï1Satï1 is used in the sense of an auspicious act.
17.26 Sat' means Reality or the highest Good, and also, O Arjuna, it is used to mean an action of exceptional merit.
17.26. In the sense of  'right one'  (or 'manifesting as being')  and in the sense of  'proper one'  (or 'manifesting perfectly'), this word  SAT is employed.  Likewise the word SAT is used with regard to the praiseworthy act; O son of Prtha !
17.26 This term Sat is used in the sense of existence and goodness. And so also, O Arjuna, the word Sat is applied to an auspicious action.
17.26 This word sat is used with regard to (something) coming into being and with regard to (someone) becoming good. So also, O son of Prtha, the word sat is used with regard to an auspicious rite.
17.26 The word Sat is applied in Vedic and common usage, in respect of all contexts to express existence (Sadbhava) and auspiciousness (Sadhubhava). Similarly, in relation to any praiseworthy worldly act, viz., auspicious undertaking by someone, the word Sat is applied to express, 'This is a good act.'
17.26 See Comment under 17.27
17.26 Etat, this; sat iti, word sat, a name of Brahman; prayujyate, is used, is uttered; sad-bhave, with regard to (something) coming into being-with regard to coming into existence of something that was not there, as for instance the birth of a son who was not there before; so also sadhu-bhave, with regard to (someone) becoming good-sadhu-bhava means coming to possess good conduct by an evil person who had bad behaviour; with regard to that. Tatha, so also, O Son of Prtha; the sat-sabdah, word sat; yujyate (-which is the same as prayujyate-), is used; prasaste karmani, with regard to an auspicious rite, such as mirage etc.
17.27 Steadfastness in sacrifice, austerity and gift, is also called 'Sat' and also action in connection with these (or for the sake of the Supreme) is called 'Sat'.
17.27 Conviction in sacrifice, in austerity and in giving is also called Sat.' So too an action done only for the Lord's sake.
17.27. The steadfastness is performing sacrifice, in austerity and in giving gift is also called SAT; and also the act for such purpose is [hence] just called SAT.
17.27 Devotion to sacrifice, austerities and gifts is also called Sat; and so any act for such purposes is named Sat.
17.27 And the steadfastness in sacrifice, austerity and charity is spoken of as sat. And even the action meant for these is, verily, called as sat (good).
17.27 Therefore, devotion of persons of the first three stations who follow the Vedas in respect of sacrifices, austerities and gifts is called Sat, since it is auspicious. So the Vedas, Vedic acts and the three stations, expressed by the term 'brahmana,' since they are characterised by their connection with the words 'Om Tat Sat,' are to be distinguished from what are not the Vedas and Vedic.
17.23-27 Om etc. upto abhidhiyate.  An indication of the Brahman i.e., an act of facing (or aiming at)  the Brahman is made by these  three words viz.,  OM, TAT and SAT.  Of  them, Om indicates that 'This purport of the scriptures is [to be ?]  accepted as long as one has bodily connection'.
 
The pronoun TAT, which denotes generality and which is incapable of denoting exclusively a particular, mentions, as far as the Brahman is concerned, the absence of intention for fruit.  An intention is not possible without reference to something particular. No doubt  [TAT] may denote all particulars  [in general]. But it would lead to intending the fruits and the doer-ship with regard to all [in general].  Even then [the Brahman] cannot have connection with any particular fruit.
 
The Vedic word SAT denotes 'prasie'.  The act, like this sacrifice etc., though perormed, truns out to be an act of the Tams (evil act) if it is performed with the idea, 'It is an evil act'.  Further, what is performed  with an intention for a particular fruit is not praiseworthy, and it causes nothing but bondage. Therefore, those, who bear in mind, 'This is a thing to be performed' - they are not fettered, even though they perform acts like sacrifice etc.  With this idea only, it has been said in the Adiparvan as -
 
'The austerity is not dirt, nor the [Vedic] study, nor the natural ritual enjoined by the Vedas, and nor the act of earning wealth by all efforts.  But, if they are struck by mind, they themselves become dirt.'
(MB, Adi. i, 210).
 
[Here in this passage]  dirt that which fetters.  Natural :  [That is, ordained ], such as -
 
'Without expecting anything, a Brahman should learn the Vedas etc., together with their six subsidiaries' etc.
 
By all effort :  by the act that is suitable and is well known in the scriptures and in the worldly practice.  By mind :  by the mind that is yoked to the traid of the Strands, Sattva etc.  [Those actions that]  have been simply ruined  [by that mind], are binding and not otherwise.  This is the idea here.
 
Therefore, the acts like sacrifice etc., and the acts, like aciring  [Wealth] etc., for that purpose, have to be perfored as being inevitable as long as the body exists.
 
Or, perhaps, the word  OM  conveys  [with regard to the Brahman]  the idea of That in Which the entire universe has been totally calmed down.  TAT conveys the idea of That of the nature of Sovereign  Independence of Will, which is nothing but comprehending the rising waves in the form of the universe.  And the word SAT denotes the act of manifestation by the Brahman - even though It is complete in Itself - as [the universe]  having  varied nature, a manifestation that  causes differences  (or duality) expanding under the weight of its Sovereign  Independenc of Will.  Hence it has been said  'In the sense of manifesting as beings and in the sense of manifesting  perfectly  [SAT is employed].'  Thus, having is front  [as a casue]  that aspect  (the Soul) of  highly tranil nature; and having in the  centre that aspect which is well connected with desire-waves viz., the desire to make gift, the desire to perform sacrifice and the desire to observe penance; this final body radiates  (or dances)  filled with a group of activities, such as  offering gift, performing sacrifice and observing austerity, and of what are conducive to them.  This triad is indeed simultaneously the inherent nature of the Unhindered One (the Soul).  So, what fruit could be there ?  And to whom ?  How ?  Whence ?  Where ?  And by what means ?				
 The act of person, with no faith, is an act of the Tamas and bears no fruit in any way and bears fruit which is nothing but the labour undertaken in bringing together the band of means [of those acts].  Hence one should not on any account remain faithless.  This is being said now :
17.27 And sthitih, steadfastness; that is yajne, in sacrifice, in the act of sacrifice; the steadfastness that is tapasi, in austerity; and the steadfastness that is dane, in charity; that ucyate, is spoken of; sat iti, as sat, by learned persons. And eva, even; the karma, action; tad-arthiyam, meant for these-for sacrifice, charity and austerity, or for Him whose names are under discussion, i.e. for God; is eva, verily; abhidhiyate, called; sat iti, as sat (good).
Thus, in this way, the acts of sacrifice, austerity, etc., even when they are devoid of sattva and goodness, become good and endued with sattva by he use of the three names of Brahman with faith.
And as regards those (sacrifice etc.), since in all cases everything is performed with a predominance of faith, therefore-
17.28 Whatever is sacrificed, given or performed, and whatever austerity is practised without faith, it is called 'Asat', O Arjuna; it is naught here or hereafter (after death).
17.28 Whatsoever is done without faith, whether it be sacrifice, austerity or gift or anything else, as called Asat' (meaning Unreal') for it is the negation of Sat,' O Arjuna! Such an act has no significance, here or hereafter."
17.28. Without faith, whatever oblation is offered, what-ever gift is made, whatever austerity is practised, and whatever action is undertaken, that is called ASAT and it is of no avail after one's death and in this world.
17.28 Whatever offering or gift is made, whatever austerity is practised and whatever action is performed without faith, that is called Asat, O Arjuna. It is naught here or hereafter.
17.28 O son of Prtha, whatever is offered in sacrifice and given in charity, as also whatever austerity is undertakne or whatever is done without, faith, is said to be of on avail. And it is of no conseence after death, nor here.
17.28 Offerings etc., when performed without faith, are Asat (i.e., unreal, bereft of efficiency), although they might be what has been enjoined by the Sastras. Why so?  Because it is naught here or hereafter; it will not lead to release nor to any desirable result in Samsara.
17.28  Asradhaya  etc.  ASAT  :  not praiseworthy (or inauspicious).  Therefore  Happiness just easily arises for those who exert in the prasieworthy (or auspicious) act.
17.28 O son of Prtha, whatever is hutam, offered in sacrifice, poured as oblation; and dattam, given in charity to Brahmanas,without faith; whatever tapah, austerity; is taptam, performed without faith; so also, whatever is krtam, done without faith, e.g. praise, salutation, etc.; all that ucyate, is said to be; asat iti, of no avail, since it is outside th course of discipline leading to Me. Ca, and, although involving great effort; na ca tat, it is of no conseence; pretya, after death, for producing (some) result; na, nor even for any result; iha, because it is condemned by the wise. [Thus it is established in this chapter that, among persons who are not at all versed in the scriptures, but are possessed of (either of the) three characterisitcs of sattva, (rajas) etc., only those shall attain to Liberation who steadfastly resort to sattva alone by partaking of sattvika food, (performing sattvika) sacrifices) etc. to te exclusion of rajasika and tamasika food etc., who destroy any defect that might arise in sacrifice etc. by uttering the names of Brahman, who have fully purified their intellect, and who have attained to the realization of Truth arising from one's being endowed with such disciplines as hearing and and thinking (sravana, manana) of, and meditation (nididhyasana) on Brahman.]
17.3 The faith of each is in accordance with his nature, O Arjuna. The man consists of his faith; as a man's faith is, so is he.
17.3 The faith of every man conforms to his nature. By nature he is full of faith. He is in fact what his faith makes him.
17.3. Corresponding to one's own sattva everybody has faith, O descendant of Bharata !  The person predominantly consists of the faith.  What one has faith in, that he is (becomes) certainly.
17.3 The faith of everyone, O Arjuna, is in accordance with his internal organ (Antahkarana). Man consists of faith. Whatever his faith is, that verily is he.
17.3 O scion of the Bharata dynasty, the faith of all beings is in accordance with their minds. This person is made up of faith as the dominant factor. He is verily what his faith is.
17.3 'Sattva' means internal organ (i.e., mind). The faith of everyone is according to his internal organ. The meaning is that with whatever Guna his internal organ is conjoined, one's faith corresponds to that Guna (i.e., Guna as object). The term Sattva covers here body, senses etc., already mentioned. Man consists of faith, viz., is the product of his faith. Of whatever faith he is, viz., with whatever faith a man is possessed, that verily he is; he is a transformation of faith of that nature. The purport is this:  If the person is associated with faith in auspicious acts he becomes associated with fruit of these auspicious acts. Conseently, attainment chiefly follows one's faith.

Sri Krsna further explains the same subject:
17.3 Sattva etc.  The word sattva in  'corresponding to one's own sattva' is a synonym of svabhava 'primary nature'.  This person i.e., Soul, is necessarily connected with a faith that dominates all [his] other activities.  [Hence], he is to be deemed just to be mainly consisting of that.
17.3 O scion of the Bharata dynasty, the sraddha, faith; sarvasya, of all beings; bhavati, is; sattva-anurupa, in accordance with their minds, in accordance with the internal organ which is imbued with particular impression. If this is so, what follows? The answer is: Ayam, this; purusah, person, the transmigrating soul; is sraddhamayah, made up of faith as the dominating factor. How? Sah, he, the individual soul; is eva, verily; sah, that; yah yat-sraddhah,which is the faith of that individual-he surely conforms to his faith.
And, as a conseence, a person's steadfastness in sattva etc. is to be inferred from the grounds of his actions such as worship of gods etc. Hence the Lord says:
17.4 The Sattvic or the pure men worship the gods; the Rajasic or the passionate worship the Yakshas and the Rakshasas; the others (the Tamasic or the deluded people) worship the ghosts and the hosts of the nature-spirits.
17.4 The Pure worship the true God; the Passionate, the powers of wealth and magic; the Ignorant, the spirits of the dead and of the lower orders of nature.
17.4. The men of the Sattva (Strand) perform sacrifice intending for the gods ;  the men of the Rajas (Strand) do for the spirits and the demons;  and the men of the Tamas (Strand)  perform sacrifices intending for the imps, the dead, and the ghosts.
17.4 The Sattvika types worship the gods. The Rajasa types worship Yaksas and Raksasas. And the others, the Tamasa types, worship the departed ancestors and hosts of Bhutas.
17.4 Those having the sattva ality worship the gods; those having rajas, the demi-gods and ogres; and other people possessed of tamas worship ghosts and the hosts of spirits.
17.4 'Those who have abundance of Sattva ality and are conjoined with Sattvika faith worship the gods. The meaning is this:  The faith in the worship (sacrifice) of the gods which causes supreme joy unmixed with pain is of Sattvika nature. The Rajasika types worship Yaksas and Raksasas. And the others, i.e., the Tamasika types, worship the departed ancestors and hosts of Bhutas. The faith born of Rajas brings about limited joy mixed with pain, while the faith born of Tamas gives rise to extremely limited joy which verges almost on pain.

Therefore, there is difference in fruits according to the Gunas regarding sacrifices etc., which are enjoined in the Sastras and associated with faith. However, no happiness whatsoever will result from penances, sacrifices etc., not enjoined in the Sastras and therefore antagonistic to My ?ndment. On the contrary, calamity results from them. Sri Krsna proceeds to explain this more fully.
17.4 See Comment under 17.6
17.4 Sattvikah, those having the sattva ality, those steadfast in sattva; yajante, worship; devan, the gods; rajasah, those having rajas; (worship) yaksa-raksamsi, the demi-gods and ogres; and anye, other; janah, people; tamasah, possessed of tamas; yajante, worship; pretan, ghosts; and bhuta-ganan, the hosts of spirits-Sapta-matrkas (the Seven Mothers) and others.
Thus, in the context of abandonment of scriptural injunctions, the states of sattva etc. have been determined through their effects. As regards that, it is only one in thousands who, being established in sattva, becomes devoted to the adoration of gods.
But, to be sure, creatures are mostly rooted deeply in rajas or tamas. How?
17.5 Those men who practise terrific austerities not enjoined by the scriptures, given to hypocrisy and egoism, impelled by the force of lust and attachment.
17.5 Those who practise austerities not commanded by scripture, who are slaves to hypocrisy and egotism, who are carried away by the fury of desire and passion,
17.5. Those men, who practise terrible austerities, not as enjoined in the scriptures; who are bound to hypocricy and conceit, and are endowed with (i.e. impelled by) the force of passion for the desired objects;
17.5 Those men who practise terrible austerity not enjoined by the Sastras, given to ostentation and conceit, and prompted by the force of sensual desires and passion;
17.5 Those persons who, given to ostentation and pride, and possessed of passion, attachment and strength, undertake severe austerities not sanctioned in the scriptures;
17.5 - 17.6 'Those men who perform terrible pernances not enjoined by the Sastras' - this is illustrative of sacrifices etc., of a similar nature. Those who perform sacrifices, etc., sacrifices which are not enjoined by the Sastras and demand much exertion, those who are possessed of 'ostentation and conceit and are goaded by sensual desire, attachment and passion' - they torture the group of elements such as earth etc., in their bodies. They also torture the individual self which is a part of Myself and is within their bodies. Those who perform such sacrifices etc., know them to be demoniacal in their resolves. The resolve of demons is demoniac resolve. The demons are those who act contrary to My ?ndments. Since they act contrary to My ?ndments, they do not have even a iota of joy, but as stated earlier, they fall a prey to a multitude of calamities. 'They fall into a foul Naraka' (16.16).

Now, Sri Krsna, resuming the subject, details the differences according to the Gunas with reference to sacrifice, etc., enjoined by the Sastras. To begin with, he describes three kinds of food, since the growth of Sattva etc., has its source in food, as Srutis declare thus:  'For my dear, the mind consists of food' (Cha. U., 6.5.4) and 'when the food is pure, the man becomes pure' (Cha. U., 7.26.2).
17.5 See Comment under 17.6
17.5 Ye, those; janah, persons; who tapyante, undertake, perform; ghoram, severe; tapah, austerity, productive of pain to oneself as also to creatures; asastra-vihitam, not sanctioned by the scriptures; they, being dambh-ahankara-samyuktah, given to ostentation and pride; and kama-raga-bala-anvitah, impelled by the strength of passion and attachment, or possessed of passion, attachment and strength [Kama-raga can also mean desirable objects and the desire to enjoy them.]-.
17.6 Senseless, torturing all the elements in the body and Me also, Who dwell in the body,  know thou these to be of demonical resolves.
17.6 They are ignorant. They torment the organs of the body; and they harass Me also, Who lives within. Know that they are devoted to evil.
17.6. Who emaciate unintelligently the conglamoration of elements in their physic and emaciate Me too, dwelling within the physic-know them to be of a demoniac resolve.
17.6 These foolish men, torturing the group of elements in their bodies and Me also who dwell within the body - know them to be demoniacal in their resolves.
17.6 (And who,) being non-discriminating, torture, all the organs in the body as also even Me who reside in the body,-know them as possessed of demoniacal conviction.
17.5 - 17.6 'Those men who perform terrible pernances not enjoined by the Sastras' - this is illustrative of sacrifices etc., of a similar nature. Those who perform sacrifices, etc., sacrifices which are not enjoined by the Sastras and demand much exertion, those who are possessed of 'ostentation and conceit and are goaded by sensual desire, attachment and passion' - they torture the group of elements such as earth etc., in their bodies. They also torture the individual self which is a part of Myself and is within their bodies. Those who perform such sacrifices etc., know them to be demoniacal in their resolves. The resolve of demons is demoniac resolve. The demons are those who act contrary to My ?ndments. Since they act contrary to My ?ndments, they do not have even a iota of joy, but as stated earlier, they fall a prey to a multitude of calamities. 'They fall into a foul Naraka' (16.16).

Now, Sri Krsna, resuming the subject, details the differences according to the Gunas with reference to sacrifice, etc., enjoined by the Sastras. To begin with, he describes three kinds of food, since the growth of Sattva etc., has its source in food, as Srutis declare thus:  'For my dear, the mind consists of food' (Cha. U., 6.5.4) and 'when the food is pure, the man becomes pure' (Cha. U., 7.26.2).
17.4-6  Yajante etc., upto asura-niscayan.  Unintelligently :  i.e. due to their lack of discrimination.  Emaciating Me too :  Because they do not follow the purport of the scriptures. That is why they undertake practising austerities invented by their own intellect and they are rather men of the Tamas (Strand). 		
 Like faith, the food also is of three types, differentiated by the Sattva etc.,  so are the sacrifice,  austerity and charity.  That is being detailed as :
17.6 (And who,) acetasah, being non-discriminating; karsayantah, torture; bhuta-gramam, all the organs; sarirastham, in the body, ca, as also; torture eva, even; mam, Me; antah-sarira-stham, who reside in the body as the witness of its actions and intellect-non-adherence to My injunctions itself is 'torturing Me'; viddhi, know; tan, them; asura-niscayan, as possessed of demoniacal convictions. Know them so that they may be avoided. This is an instruction.
The liking of persons possessing the alities of sattva, rajas and tamas for foods that are divided into three groups, viz succulent, oleaginous, etc., is respectively being shown here so that, by knowing the presence of the alities of sattva, rajas and tamas (in oneself) from the indications of the degree of one's preference for particular foods as are succulent, oleaginous, etc., one may avoid foods having the characteristics of rajas and tamas, and accept food with the characteristics of sattva. Similarly, sacrifices etc. also are being explained here under three categories according to the distinguishing ality of sattva etc. So that one may reject those known to be born of rajas and tamas, and undertake only those born of sattva.
17.7 The food also which is dear to each is threefold, as also sacrifice, austerity and almsgiving. Hear thou the distinction of these.
17.7 The food which men enjoy is also threefold, like the ways of sacrifice, austerity and almsgiving. Listen to the distinction.
17.7. Further, the food also, which is dear to all, is of three kinds.  So are [their] sacrifice, austerity and charity.  Listen to this distinction of them.
17.7 Even the food which is dear to all is threefold. So are sacrifices, austeritty and gifts. Listen about this distinction among them.
17.7 Food also, which is dear to all, is of three kinds; and so also are sacrifices, austerity and charity. Listen to this classification of them.
17.7 Even the food which is dear to the host of all beings is of three kinds because of the association of the three Gunas consisting of Sattva etc. Similarly, sacrifices also are of three kinds. So too austerity and charity. Listen about this distinction, which is being described, about foods, sacrifices, austerities and gifts according to differences of Sattva etc.
17.7 See Comment under 17.10
17.7 Aharah, food; api tu, also; which is priyah, dear; sarvasya, to all [Here Ast. adds praninah (creatures).-Tr.] who eat it; bhavati, is; trividhah, of three kinds; so also yajnah, sacrifices; similarly, tapah, austerity; tatha, so also; danam, charity. Srnu, listen; to imam, this; bhedam, classification; tesam, of them, of food etc., which is going to be stated.
17.8 The foods which increase life, purity, strength, health, joy and cheerfulness (good appetite), which are savoury and oleaginous, substantial and agreeable, are dear to the Sattvic (pure) people.
17.8 The foods that prolong life and increase purity, vigour, health, cheerfulness and happiness are those that are delicious, soothing, substantial and agreeable. These are loved by the Pure.
17.8. The foods that increase life, energy, strength, good health, happiness and satisfaction; and which are delicious, soft, substantial and pleasant to heart (stomach) - they are dear to the men of the Sattva (Strand).
17.8 Foods which promote longevity, intellectual alertness, strength, health, pleasure and happiness and those that are sweet, oil, substantial and agreeable, are dear to Sattvika men.
17.8 Foods that augment life, firmless of mind, strength, health, happiness and delight, and which are succulent, oleaginous, substantial and agreeable, are dear to one endowed with sattva.
17.8 To a man endowed with Sattva, foods preponderating in Sattva become dear. The foods preponderating in Sattva promote longevity. Again they promote intellectual alertness. 'Sattva', means internal organ, viz., knowledge which is the effect of the internal organ is here meant by the term Sattva. For the Sattva is the cause of growth of knowledge, as declared in:  'From Sattva arises knowledge' (14.17). Even as the food preponderant in Sattva is the cause of the growth of knowledge, likewise, they promote strength and health; they also promote pleasure and happiness. As the time of assimilation they, by themselves, promote happiness, viz, by the performance of actions which cause happiness. They are sweet, viz., abundant in sweet juices. They are mixed with oil, viz., wholly oily. They are substantial, viz., they originate substantial effects. They are agreeable viz., they appear to the eye in beautiful forms. Food of this kind, full of Sattva-guna, is dear to the person characterised by Sattva.
17.8 See Comment under 17.10
17.8 Aharah, foods; ayuh-sattva-bala-arogya-sukha-priti-vivardhanah, that augment life, firmneess of mind, strength, health delight; [Life-a brilliant life; firmness of mind or vigour; strength-ability of body and organs; happiness-pleasure of mind; delight-great joy even at seeing other persons prosperous.] and which are rasyah, succulent; snigdhah, oleaginous; sthirah, substantial, lasing in the body for long; [Beneficial to the body for long.] and hrdyah, agreeable, to one's liking; are sattvika-priyah, dear to one endowed with sattva.
17.9 The foods that are bitter, sour, saline, excessively hot, pungent, dry and burning, are liked by the Rajasic and are productive of pain, grief and disease.
17.9 Those in whom Passion is dominant like foods that are bitter, sour, salty, over-hot, pungent, dry and burning. These produce unhappiness, repentance and disease.
17.9. The foods that are killed by men of the Rajas (Strand) are those which are bitter,  sour, saltish, very hot, harsh, dry, and burning; and which cause pain, grief and disease.
17.9 Foods that are bitter, sour, very salty, exceedingly heating, very pungent, dry and burning, are all dear to Rajasika men; they produce pain, sorrow and disease.
17.9 Foods that are bitter, sour, salty, very hot, pungent, dry and burning, and which production pain, sorrow and disease, are dear to one having rajas.
17.9 The foods that are bitter, sour, very salty, over-hot, very pungent, dry and burning, are those that they the taste (Rasa) of bitterness and sourness, that are inordinately salty, hot, pungent, and that are dry and burning. Pungent foods are those which are unsuitable and difficult to be taken by others because of their being ver cold, ver hot etc. Dry things are those which cause the feeling of dryness in the eater. Burning foods are those which cause burning sensation. Foods of this kind are relished by men of Rajasik nature. They promote pain, sorrow and disease.
17.9 See Comment under 17.10
17.9 Foods that are katu-amla-lavana-atyusna-tiksna-ruksa-vidahinah, bitter, sour, salty, very hot (-'very' is to be connected with all, viz bitter etc.; that is very bitter, very sour, and so on-), pungent, dry [Without fat.] and burning; and duhkha-soka-amaya-pradah, which produce pain, sorrow and disease; [Pain, immediate suffering; sorrow, grief arising from not having that desired food.] are rajasasyaistah, dear to one having rajas.
18.1 Arjuna said  I desire to know severally, O mighty-armed, the essence or truth of renunciation, O Hrishikesa, as also of abandonment, O slayer of Kesi.
18.1 "Arjuna asked: O mighty One! I desire to know how relinquishment is distinguished from renunciation.
18.1. Arjuna said  O  Mighty-armed !  I desire to know severally the distinctive nature of renunciation and of relinishment,  O  Hrsikesa !  O Slayer of  Kesin !
18.1 Arjuna said  I desire to know the truth about renunciation (Sannyasa) and abnegation (Tyaga) severally, O Krsna.
18.1 Arjuna said  O mighty-armed Hrsikesa, O slayer of (the demon) Kesi, I want to know serverally the truth about sannyasa as also about tyaga.
18.1 Arjuna said  Both Sannyasa and Tyaga as a means for release are enjoined in such Srutis:  'Not by rituals, nor by progeny, nor by rituals, nor by progeny, nor by wealth but by Tyaga alone do some attain immortality ৷৷.' (Ma. Na., 5.14). Ascertaining the truth about the Supreme Reality from a knowledge of Vedanta, and becoming purified in mind by the means of Sannyasa Yoga, these Yatis (ascetics), at the dissolution of their bodies, attain the Lord who is higher than the freed selves and become liberated from bondage' (Man. U., 3.2.6). I want to know separately the truth, viz., whether Tyaga and Sannyasa are synonymous or not.

The import is this. Do these two terms Sannyasa and Tyaga have different meanings or do they signify the same thing?  If they signify different things, I want to know their different natures. If they are synonymous, their identical nature should be elucidated.

Then, in order to prove that the nature of both is identical and that it is such and such, the Lord explains, showing the disagreements among some disputants:
18.1 Samnyasaya etc.  It has been delcared earlier that  'He [alone]  is a man of relinishment and is also a man of wisdom'  (II, 50); and  'He  [alone] is a man of renunciation and a man of Yoga; but not he who remains without his fires (VI, 1)',  and so on. Thus, becuase a man of relinishment and a man of renunciation are both found mentioned, now arises this estion from a person (Arjuna) who is desirous of understanding their difference.  					
 Now [by giving] the answer -
18.1 O mighty-armed Hrsikesa, kesi-nisudana, O slayer of (the demon) Kesi; icchami, I want; veditum, to know; prthak, severally, through their mutual distinctions; tattvam, the truth, the intrinsic nature, i.e. the real meaning; sannyasasya, of sannyasa, i.e. the meaning of the word sannyasa, ca, as also; tyagasya, of tyaga, i.e. the meaning of the word tyaga.
Kesi was a demon who had assumed the form of a horse, and Lord Vasudeva had killed him. Hence He is addressed by that name (Kesi-nisudana) by Arjuna.
The word sannyasa and tyaga, used in various places in the preceding chapters, are not explicit in their implications. Therefore, in order to determine them for Arjuna who had put the estion,-
18.10 The man of renunciation, pervaded by purity, intelligent, and with his doubts cut asunder, does not hate a disagreeable work nor is he attached to an agreeable one.
18.10 The wise man who has attained purity, whose doubts are solved, who is filled with the spirit of self-abnegation, does not shrink from action because it brings pain, nor does he desire it because it brings pleasure.
18.10. The man of relinishment, who is well possessed of the Sattva, is wise and has his doubts destroyed-he hates not the unskilled action and clings not to the skilled action.
18.10 One who has abandoned, who is imbued with Sattva, who is wise, whose doubts have been dispelled - such a person hates not disagreeable acts nor clings to agreeable ones.
18.10 The man of renunciation who has become imbued with sattva, who is wise and freed from doubts, does not hate unbefitting action, nor does he become attached to befitting activity.
18.10 Thus, 'filled with Sattva,' endowed with right knowledge, i.e., with the knowledge of the reality as it is, and as a conseence of it 'having all doubts shattered' - he alone becomes a renouncer of attachment to work and the fruits of work. He 'neither hates works productive of harmful effects,' nor 'loves others productive of worldly prosperity.' Disagreeable acts are fraught with undesirable fruits; and agreeable acts bring about desirable results such as heaven, sons, cows, food etc. On account of his renouncing all results other than the Brahman and on account of his renouncing the sense of agency, he shows neither love nor hatred for above-mentioned types of works. Here 'sinful acts having undesirable fruits' are only such acts as are inadvertently performed. For it has been taught in the Srutis that nor turning away from bad conduct is antagonistic to the production of knowledge. 'But one who has not ceased from bad conduct, who is not tranil, is not composed, is not of peaceful mind, cannot obtain Him by knowledge' (Ka. U., 1.2.24). Thus, 'the abandonment' according to the Sastras is renunciation of the sense of agency, attachment and fruits of actions, and not total relinishment of actions as such.

He explains this further:
18.10 See Comment under 18.11
18.10 Na devesti, he does not hate; akusalam, unbefitting; karma, action, rites and duties meant for desired results-with the idea, 'What is the usefulness of this which is a cause of transmigration through fresh embodiment?' Na anusajjate, he does not become attached to; kusale, befitting activity, daily obligatory duties, by thinking that this is the cause of Liberation by virtue of its being the cause of purification of the mind, rise of Knowledge and steadfastness in it. That is to say, he does not entertain any liking even for it, because he finds no purpose in it.
Who, again, is he? Tyagi, the man of renunciation, who has become so by having given up attachment and rewards of action in the manner stated above. He is a tyagi who performs nityakarmas by relinishing attachment to those acts and (their) results.
Again, it is being stated as to when that person does not hate an unbefitting act and does not become attached to a befitting activity: When he has become sattva-samavistah, imbued with sattva, i.e., when he is filled with, possessed of, sattva, which is the means to the knowledge that discriminates between the Self and the not-Self; and hence medhavi, wise-endowed with intelligence (medha), intuitive experience, characterized as knowledge of the Self; one possessed of that is medhavai (wise)-; and owing to the very fact of being wise, chinnasamsayah, freed from doubts-one whose doubts created by ignorance have been sundered, one who is freed from doubts by his firm conviction that nothing but abiding in the ture nature of the Self is the supreme means to the highest Good.
The person competent (for rites and duties) who, having gradually become purified in mind through the practice of Karma-yoga in the way described above, has realized as his own Self the actionless Self, which is devoid of modifications like birth etc., he, '৷৷.having given up all actions mentally, remaining at without doing or causing (others) to do anything at all' (cf. 5.13), attains steadfastness in Knowledge, which is characterized as 'actionless-ness'. In this way, the purpose of the aforesaid Karma-yoga has been stated through the present verse.
On the other hand, since, for the unenlightened person-who, while being alified (for rites and duties), holds on to the body owing to the erroneous conception that the body is the Self, and who has the firm conviction, 'I am the agent,' because of the persistence of his idea that the Self is the agent-it is not possible to renounce actions totally, therefore he has competence only for performing enjoined duties by giving up fruits of actions. But he is not to renounce them (actions). In order to point out this idea the Lord says:
18.11 Verily, it is not possible for an embodied being to abandon actions entirely; but he who relinishes the rewards of actions is verily called a man of renunciation.
18.11 But since those still in the body cannot entirely avoid action, in their case abandonment of the fruit of action is considered as complete renunciation.
18.11. Indeed, to relinish actions entirely is not possible for a body-bearing one; but whosoever relinishes the fruits  of actions, he is said to be a man of [true] relinishment.
18.11 For, it is impossible for one who bears a body to abandon actions entirely. But he who gives up the fruits of works, is called the abandoner.
18.11 Since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body to give up actions entirely, therefore he, on the other hand, who renounces results on actions is called a man of renunciation.
18.11 It is impossible for one who has a body and has to nourish it. 'to abandon action entirely'; for eating, drinking etc., reired for nourshing the body and other acts connected therewith are unavoidable. And for the same reason the five great sacrifices etc., are also indispensable. He who has given up the fruits of the five great sacrifices, is said to have renounced; this is referred to in the Srutis such as:  'Only through renunciation do some obtain immortality' (Ma. Na., 8.14). Renunciation of fruits of actions is illustrative; it implies much more. It implies one who has renounced the fruits, agency and attachment to works, as the topic has been begun with the declaration: 'For abandonment (Tyaga) is declard to be of three kinds' (18.4).

This statement may be estioned in the following manner: 'Agnihotra, the full moon and new moon sacrifices, Jyotistoma etc., and also the five great sacrifices are enjoined by the Sastras only for the attainment of their results like heaven. They are not purposeless. Even the injunction with regard to obligatory and occasional ceremonies is enjoined because they yield results, as implied in the following passage:  "For householders, Prajapatya ceremony" (V.P., 1.6.37). Therefore, as the performance of actions has to be understood as a means for attaining their respective results, the accruing of agreeable and disagreeable results is inevitable, even though they are performed without any desire for fruits, just as a seed sown must grow into a tree and bear fruit. Hence, actions ought not to be performed by an aspirant for release, because the results are incompatible with release. Sri Krsna answers such objections:
18.4-11 Niscayam etc.  upto abhidhiyate.  The conclusion here is  this :  Due to the manifoldness of the nature of the Strands, that have been defined earlier, the act of relinishment itself is performed with a certain mental disposition which is a modification of the Sattva, the Rajas and the Tamas (the Strands).  Because it reflects  (is contaminated by)  the nature of the person having the same (the said mental dispositon),  what is called the real (unalloyed)  relinishment is the performance of the actions  by the knowers of the Supreme Brahman by giving up desire to achieve fruits and by avoiding the craving and hatred on account of their eanimity to [the pairs of opposites like]  success and failure etc.  That is why [the Bhagavat] says :  'By the act of relinishment born of the Rajas or of the Tamas  (Strands), no connection with the fruit  [of relinishment] is attained'.  However, for an act of relinishing, born of the Sattva (Strand), there is the fruit in the form of honouring the purport of the scriptures.  The application of the term  'relinishment'  stands to reason, in fact, only in the case of a sage who has relinished his holding on the multitude of the Strands.
18.11 Deha-bhrta, for one who holds on to a body-one who maintains (bibharti) a body (deha) is called a deha-bhrt. One who has self-indentification with the body is called a deha-bhrt, but not a so a man of discrimination; for he has been excluded from the eligibility for agentship by such texts as, 'He who knows this One is indestructible৷৷.' etc. Hence, for that unenlightened person who holds on to the body, he, since; it is na, not; sakyam, possible; tyaktum, to give up, renounce; karmani, actions; asesatah, entirely, totally; therefore the ignorant person who is competent (for rites and duties), yah, who; tu, on the other hand; karma-phala-tyagi, renounces results of actions, relinishes only the hankering for the results of actions while performing the nityakarmas; sah, he; is abhidhiyate, called; tyagi iti, a man of renunciation-even though he continues to be a man of rites and duties. This is said by way of eulogy.
Therefore total renunciation of actions is possible only for one who has realized the supreme Truth, who does not hold on to the body, and who is devoid of the idea that the body is the Self.
Again, what is that purpose which is accomplished through renunciation of all actions? This is being stated:
18.12 The threefold fruit of action (evil, good and mixed) accrues after death to the non-abandoners, but never to the abandoners.
18.12 For those who cannot renounce all desire, the fruit of action hereafter is threefold - good, evil, and partly good and partly evil. But for him who has renounced, there is none.
18.12. The three-fold fruit of action, viz., the undesired, the desired and the mixed, accrues [even] after death ot those who are not men of relinishment, but never to those who are men of renunciation.
18.12 Undesirable, desirable and mixed - thus threefold is the fruit of work that accrues after death to those who have not renounced; but to those who have renounced, none whatsoever.
18.12 The threefold results of actions-the undesirable, the desirable, and the mixed-accrues after death to those who do not resort to renunciation, but never to those who resort to monasticism.
18.12 The 'undesirable result' is Naraka etc., 'the desirable' is heaven etc., 'the mixed' is sons, cows, food etc., which are combined with some undesirable results. Those who have not renounced, namely, those who are devoid of renunciation of agency, possessiveness and fruits - they meet with threefold conseences after death. The meaning of 'after death' (Pretya) may be understood as subseent to the performance of actions. But 'to those who have renounced, none whatsoever,' viz., to those who have relinished the sense of agency etc., no such results antagonistic to release accrue.

Here the purport is this:  Agnihotra, the great sacrifices etc. are obligatory throughout life and are reired for attaining the objects of desire; but in regard to release their application is different. Though externally they appear to be the same in their nature in both the conditions, they are different in their fruits by virtue of difference in application. Their application to release is seen in such texts as 'The Brahmanas desire to know Him by the study of the Vedas, by sacrifices, by gifts, by austerities conjoined with fasting' (Br. U., 4.4.22). Here the performance of actions without sense of agency is enforced. Such giving up agency etc., are relevant only with regard to acts that are actually performed. Thus Sannyasa or renouncing of this kind is established in the Sastras. The same is also called Tyaga or giving up.

Sri Krsna now explains the manner of realising that one is non-agent, by attributing all agency to God, who is the Supreme Person and the Inner Ruler, By cultivating this attitude, an aspirant can attain the renunciation of possessiveness with regard to actions and also their fruits. For it is the Supreme Person who performs all actions through the individual selves who belong to Him. The organs, bodies and Pranas of embodied beings are His. They exist for the sake of His own sport as the only purpose. Therefore, even the appeasement of hunger etc., and such other acts which affect the life of the individual souls and their works constitute only the means for accomplishing that purpose, namely, the sport of the Highest Purusa Himself. The purport of the argument is this:  The analogy of seeds producing the tree and its fruits is not applicable to the actions of release-seekers. Their actions may look like those of fruit-seekers externally. But as mentally they do not entertain any such purpose, the conseence of their actions can be ite different. The purpose served by their actions is only affording sport for the Supreme Being.
18.12 Anistam etc.  To those who are not men of relinishment :  to those who are full of [desire for]  fruit.								
 Even at the stage of mundane life, where all the five factors do exist for actions, those persons, blind with their ignorance, obstinately burden their own Self with the entire load of agency.  Hence they fetter their own Self with their own thinking.  But, in fact, there is no bondage for Him (the Self).  This is now being taught as :
18.12 These trividham, threefold-of three kinds; phalam, results; karmanah, of actions characterized as the righteous and the unritheous; anistam, the undesirable, consisting in (birth in) hell, (among) animals, etc.; istam, the desirable, consisting in (birth as) gods and others; and misram, the mixed, having a mixture of the desirable and the undesirable, consisting in (birht as) human beings;-these results that are of these kinds, bhavati, accrues; pretya, after death, after the fall of the body; atyaginam, to those who do not resort to renunciation, to the unilllumined, the men with rites and duties, who are not men of renunciation in the truest sense.
The derivative sense of the word phala (pha-la) is this: On accunt of being accomplished through the operation of diverse external accessories, and a result of ignorance, comparable to the charm cast by jugglery, a source of great delusion and appearing as though close to the indwelling Self, it is phalgu (unsubstantial), and as a conseence it undergoes layam (disappearance).
(The result that is of this kind accrues to those who do not resort to renunciation). Tu, but; na kvacit, never; sannyasinam, to those who resort tomonasticism for the sake of the highest Reality, to the class of monks called paramahamsas who remain steadfast in Knowledge alone. For, it cannot be that those who are devoted wholly to steadfastness in complete enlightenment do not dig out the seed of transmigration. This is the meaning.
Therefore it is only for those who have realized the supreme Truth that it is possible to become a monk who renounces actions totally, because action, accessories and results are superimmpositions on the Self through ignorance. But the renunciation of all actions is not possible for an unenlightened person who perceives the locus (the body etc.), action, agentship and accessories as the Self. This the Lord shows in the following verses:
18.13 Learn from Me, O mighty-armed Arjuna, these five causes as declared in the Sankhya system for the accomplishment of all actions.
18.13 I will tell thee now, O Mighty Man, the five causes which, according to the final decision of philosophy, must concur before an action can be accomplished.
18.13. O mighty-armed one !  Learn from Me these following five causes that have been declared in the conclusion of deliberations [on proper knowledge], for the accomplishment of all actions.
18.13 Learn from Me, O Arjuna, these five causes for the accomplishment of all acts, as described in Sankhya-krtanta - the science of the exact understanding of things for the accomplishment of works.
18.13 O mighty-armed one, learned from Me these [Another reading is etani.-Tr.] five factors for the accomplishment of all actions, which have been spoken of in the Vedanta in which actions terminate.
18.13 'Sankhya' means Buddhi (reasoning). 'Sankhya-krtanta' means that which is determined after due deliberations by the Buddhi in accordance with the Vedas on the nature of the things as they are. Learn them from Me. There are five causes for the accomplishment of all actions. But the understanding according to the Vedas (Vaidiki-buddhi) is that the Supreme Self alone is the agent working through body, senses, Pranas and the individual self, as asserted in the following Srutis:  'He who, dwelling in the self, who rules the self from within your self, the Inner Ruler, immortal' (Br. U. Madh., 3.7.22), and 'He who has penetrated the interior, is the Ruler of all creatures and the Self of all' (Tai. A., 3.11.3).

Sri Krsna nows sets forth the five causes:
18.13 See Comment under 18.17
18.13 O mighty-armed one, nibodha, learn; me, from Me; imani, these; panca, five; karanani, factors, accessories, which are going to be stated-for drawing the attention of his (Arjuna's) mind and for showing the difference among these categories [Categories: locus (body) etc], the Lord praises those accessories in the succeeding verses as fit for being known-; siddhaye, for the accomplishment; sarva-karmanam, of all actions; proktani, which have been spoken of; sankhye, in Vedanta-sankhya is that scripture where the subject-matters [In the sentence, 'Thou art That', the word Thou means the individual Self, and That means Brahman. The comprehension of their unity, and also 'hearing, reflection and meditation' are referred to as the subject-matters.] to be known are fully (samyak) stated (khyayante)-; krtante, in which actions terminate. Krtante alifies that very word (Vedanta).
Krtam mean action. That in which occurs the culmination (anta) of that krtam is krtantam, i.e. the termination of actions. In the texts, '৷৷.as much utility as a man has in a well' (2.46), and 'O son of Prtha, all actions in their totality culminate in Knowledge' (4.33), the Lord shows the cessation of all actions when the knowledge of the Self dawns. Hence (it is said): '৷৷.which have been spoken of in that Vedanta where actions culminate and which is meant for the knowledge of the Self.'
Which are they? This is being answered:
18.14 The seat (body), the doer, the various senses, the different functions of various sorts, and the presiding deity, also, the fifth.
18.14 They are a body, a personality, physical organs, their manifold activity and destiny.
18.14. The basis, as well as the agent, and diverse instruments, and distinct activity of various kinds and Destiny, which is certainly the fifth [factor].
18.14 The seat of action and likewise the agent, the various kinds of organs, the different and distinctive functions of vital air and also the fifth among these, Divinity.
18.14 The locus as also the agent, the different kinds of organs, the many and distinct activities, and, the divine is here the fifth.
18.14 - 18.15 For all actions, performed through body, words or mind, whether they be authorized by the Sastras or not, the causes are these five. (1) The body, which is a conglomeration of the 'great elements,' is known as the seat, since it is governed by the individual self. (2) The agent is the individual self. That this individual self is the knower and the agent is established in the Vedanta-Sutras:  'For this reason, (the individual self) is the knower' (2.3.18) and 'The agent, on account of the scripture having a purport' (2.3.33.). (3) The organs of various kinds are the five motor organs like that of speech, hands, feet etc., along with the mind. They are of various kinds, viz., they have different functions in completing an action. (4) The different and distinctive functions of vital air - here the expression 'functions' (Cesta) means several functions. Distinctive are the functions of this fivefold vital air which sustains the body and senses through its divisions of Prana, Apana etc. (5) Divinity is the fifth among these causes. The purport is this:  Among these, which constitute the conglomeration of causes of work the Divinity is the fifth. It is the Supreme Self, the Inner Ruler, who is the main cause in completing the action.

It has been already affirmed:  'I am seated in the hearts of all. From Me are memory, knowledge and their removal also' (15.15), and He will say further:  'The Lord, O Arjuna, lives in the heart of every being casuing them to spin round and round by His power as if set on a wheel' (18.61). The agency of the individual self is dependent on the Supreme Self as established in the aphorism:  'But from the Supreme, because the scripture says so' (B. S., 2.3.41).

Now an objection may be raised in this way:  If the agency of the individual self is dependent on the Supreme Self and the individual self cannot be charged with moral responsibility, then the scriptures containing injunctions and prohibitions become useless, as the individual self cannot be enjoined to act in regard to any action. The objection is disposed off by the author of the Vedanta-Sutras in the aphorism:  'But with a view to the effects made on account of the purposelessness of injunctions and prohibitions' (2.3.42).

The purport is this:  By means of his senses, body etc., granted by the Supreme Self - having Him for their support, empowered by Him, and thus deriving power from Him - the individual self begins, of his own free will, the effort for directing the senses etc., for the purpose of performing actions conditioned by his body and organs. The individual self Itself, of Its own free will, is responsible for activity, since the Supreme Self, abiding within, causes It to act only by granting His permission, just as works such as moving heavy stones and timber are collectively the labour of many persons and they are together responsible for the effect. But each one of them (severally) also is responsible for it. In the same way each individual is answerable to Nature's law in the form of positive and negative ?ndments.
18.14 See Comment under 18.17
18.14 Adhisthanam, the locus, the body, which is the seat, the basis, of the manifestation of desire, hatred, happiness, sorrow, knowledge, etc.; tatha, as also karta, the agent, the enjoyer [The individual Self which has intelligence etc. as its limiting adjuncts, due to which it appears to possess their characteristics and become identified with them.] who has assumed the characteristics of the limiting adjuncts; prthak vidham, the different kinds of; karanam, organs, the ears etc. which, twelve [The five organs of knowledge (eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin), the five organs of actions (hands, feet, speech, organ of excertion and that of generation), the mind and the intellect.] in number, are of different kinds for the experience of sound etc.; the vividhah, many; and prthak, distinct; cesta, activities connected with air-exhalation, inhalation, etc.; ca eva, and; daivam, the divine, i.e. the Sun and the others who are the presiding deities of the eye etc.; is atra, here, in relation to these four; pancamam, the fifth-completing the five.
18.15 Whatever action a man performs with his body, speech and mind  whether right or the reverse  these five are its causes.
18.15 Whatever action a man performs, whether by muscular effort or by speech or by thought, and whether it be right or wrong, these five are the essential causes.
18.15. O Arjuna !  Whatever action is undertaken with the body, speech or the mind, whether it is lawful or otherwise, its factors are these five.
18.15 For whatever action a man undertakes by his body, speech and mind, whether right or wrong, i.e., enjoined or forbidden by the Sastras, the following five are its causes:
18.15 Whatever action a man performs with the body, speech and mind, be it just or its reverse, of it these five are the cuases.
18.14 - 18.15 For all actions, performed through body, words or mind, whether they be authorized by the Sastras or not, the causes are these five. (1) The body, which is a conglomeration of the 'great elements,' is known as the seat, since it is governed by the individual self. (2) The agent is the individual self. That this individual self is the knower and the agent is established in the Vedanta-Sutras:  'For this reason, (the individual self) is the knower' (2.3.18) and 'The agent, on account of the scripture having a purport' (2.3.33.). (3) The organs of various kinds are the five motor organs like that of speech, hands, feet etc., along with the mind. They are of various kinds, viz., they have different functions in completing an action. (4) The different and distinctive functions of vital air - here the expression 'functions' (Cesta) means several functions. Distinctive are the functions of this fivefold vital air which sustains the body and senses through its divisions of Prana, Apana etc. (5) Divinity is the fifth among these causes. The purport is this:  Among these, which constitute the conglomeration of causes of work the Divinity is the fifth. It is the Supreme Self, the Inner Ruler, who is the main cause in completing the action.

It has been already affirmed:  'I am seated in the hearts of all. From Me are memory, knowledge and their removal also' (15.15), and He will say further:  'The Lord, O Arjuna, lives in the heart of every being casuing them to spin round and round by His power as if set on a wheel' (18.61).

18.15 Yat, whatever; karma, action; narah, a man; prarabhate, performs; with these three-sarira-van-manobhih, with the body, speech and mind; be it nyayyam, just, rigtheous, conforming to the scriptures; va, or; viparitam, its reverse, not conforming to the scriptures, unrighteous; and even such activities like closing the eyes etc. whch are conseent on the fact of living (i.e. instinctive acts)-they also are certainly the result of righteous and unrighteous acts done in earlier lives, and hence they are understood by the very, use of the words 'just and its reverse'-; tasya, of it, of all activities without exception; ete, these; panca, five, as mentioned; are the hetavah, causes.
Objection: Well, are not the locus etc. the cause of all actions? Why is it said, '৷৷.performs with the body, speech and mind'?
Reply: This fault does not arise. All actions described as 'enjoined' or 'prohibited' are mainly based on the three, body etc. Seeing, hearing, etc., which are characteristics of life and are subsidiaries to these (body etc.) [Seeing etc. are accomplished by the eye etc., which are part and parcel of the body etc.] , are divided into three groups and spoken of in, 'performs with the body,' etc. Even at the time of reaping the fruits (of actions), they are experienced mainly through these (three). Hence, there is no contradiction with the assertion that the five are the causes.
18.16 Now, such being the case, verily he who  owing to untrained understanding  looks upon his Self, which is isolated, as the agent, he of perverted intelligence, sees not.
18.16 But the fool who supposes, because of his immature judgment, that it is his own Self alone that acts, he perverts the truth and does not see rightly.
18.16. But this being the case, whosoever views himself as the sole agent (cause of actions) due to his imperfect intellect - he, the defective-minded one, does not view  [things rightly].
18.16 Such being the case, he who sees only the self as the agent on account of the uncultivated understanding - he, of wicked mind, does not see at all.
18.16 This being the case, anyone, who, owing to the imperfection of his intellect, perceives the absolute Self as the agent, that man does not perceive (properly), and has a perverted intellect.
18.16 In fact, the agency of the individual self is subject to the consent of Supreme Self; such being the case, if the 'individual self regards Itself as the agent,' It is of wicked or perverse mind. For, It does not perceive the agent as It really is, since It possesses an 'uncultivated understanding,' namely, an understanding which does not reveal the real state of affairs.
18.16 See Comment under 18.17
18.16 Tatra is used for connecting with the topic under discussion. Tatra evam sati, this being the case, when actions are thus accomplished by the five causes mentioned above;-this portion has to be connected with 'perverted intellect' by way of causality [Actions are done by the body etc., but since a person thinks that the Self is the agent, therefore he is said to have a perverted intellect.]-yah, tu, anyone, an unenlightened person, who; pasyati, perceives; kevalam, the absolute, pure; atmanam, Self; as the kartaram, agent-thinking, 'I myself am the agent of the actions being done by them', as a conseence of imagining the Self as identified with them; why?-akrta-buddhitvat, owing to the imperfection of his intellect, owing to his intellect not having been refined by the instructions of Vedanta and the teachers, and by reasoning-.
Even the person who, believing in the Self as distinct from the body etc., looks upon the distinct [Ast. omits anyam (distinct).-Tr.], absolute Self as the agent, he, too, is surely of imperfect intellect.
Hence, owing to his having an imperfect intellect, sah, that man; na, does not; pasyati, perceive (properly) either the truth about the Self or about actions. This is the meaning. Therefore he is a durmatih, man of perverted intellect, in the sense that his intellect is contemptible, perverse, corrupted, and the cause of repeatedly undergoing births and deaths. He does not perceive even while seeing-like the man suffering from Timira seeing many moons, or like one thinking the moon to be moving when (actually) the clouds are moving, or like the one seated on some conveyance (e.g. palanin), thinking oneself to be moving when others (the bearers) are moving.
Who, again, is the man of right intellect who perceives correctly? This is being answered:
18.17 He who is free from the egoistic notion, whose intelligence is not tainted (by good or evil), 
though he slays these people, he slayeth not, nor is he bound (by the action).
18.17 He who has no pride, and whose intellect is unalloyed by attachment, even though he kill these people, yet he does not kill them, and his act does not bind him.
18.17. He, whose mental disposition is not dominated by the sense  'I', and whose intellect is not stained - he, even if he slays these worlds, does not [really]  slay any and he is not fettered.
18.17 He who is free from the notion 'I am the doer,' and whose understanding is not tainted - slays not, though he slays all these men, nor is he bound.
18.17 He who has not the feeling of egoism, whose intellect is not tainted, he does not kill, nor does he become bound-even by killing these creatures!
18.17 He who, through the contemplation of the agency of the Supreme Being, is free from the self-conceit, 'I alone do everything'; he whose understanding is not therefore tainted, and has come to be informed by the understanding; 'As I am not the agent of this work, its fruit is not connected with me; so this work does not belong to me' - such a person, though he slays all these men, not merely Bhisma, etc., does not slay them. Therefore, he is not bound by the actions known as battle. The meaning is that the fruits of such actions do not accrue to him.

Sri Krsna now teaches how action is induced. For this he differentiates actions generated by Sattva and the other Gunas. The object is to inculcate the desirability of the Sattvika type. For, only meditation on the self not being the agent, brings about the growth of Sattva.
18.13-17 Panca etc. upto na nibadhyate Conclusion :  the established end, because here a decision is arrived at.  Basis : the material object Destiny :  the good and  bad result  [of actions] previously accumulated.  These five viz., the basis etc., constitute the entire assembly of factors and hence they are the causes for each action.
 
But other [commentators give an etymology of]  adhisthana 'basis' to mean 'That by which all actions are governed'; and on that ground they believe that it denotes that action which exists in the intellect; which comes ot be due to the Rajas, and is being prone to transform itself into the pentad of (the mental dispositions viz.)  the content, the faith, the happiness, the desire to know and the aversion to know; which is referable by the term karma-yoga  (that which yokes man into activity); and which is described at times by the term prayatna 'effort'.
 
Agent :  the ascertainer characterised by the intellect.  Instrument :  [the personal instruments viz.] the mind, the eye etc., and also the external ones like sword etc.  Activity :  the activity of  upper life-breath, nether life-breath etc.  The effects of the righteous and unrighteous acts are indicated by the term Destiny.  All the dispositions located in the intellect are indicated by these two.  Still other commentators, however, take Basis to be the Absolute Lord.
 
Due to his  imperfect intellect :  because of his having indecisive  knowledge.  But he, who performs actions with the stability due to disappearance of th I-sense  (limited) and  [a stability] refined by hundreds of reasoning, as detailed earlier - he does not get the fetter, because he is a man of perfect intellect.  This is what is intended  [in the passage under study].
18.17 Yasya, he who, the person whose intellect is refined by the instructions of the scriptures and the teachers, and reason; who has na, not; ahankrtah bhavah, the feeling of egoism, in whom does not occur the notion in the form, 'I am the agent'; i.e., he who sees thus: 'These five, viz locus etc. (14), imagined in the Self through ignorance, are verily the agents of all actions; not I. But I am the absolute, unchanging witness of their functions, 'Without vita force, without mind, pure, superior to the (other) superior immutable (Maya)" (Mu. 2.1.1)'; yasya, whose; buddhih, intellect, the internal organ, which is the limiting adunct of the Self; is na, not; lipyate, tainted, does not become regretful thinking, 'I have done this; as a result, I shall enter into hell'; whose intellect does not become thus tainted, he has a good intellect and he perceives (rightly). Api, even; hatva, by killing; iman, these; lokan, creatures, i.e. all living beings; sah he; does not hanti, kill-he does not perform the act of killing; nor does he nibadhyate, become bound, nor even does he become connected with its result, the fruit of an unrighteous action.
Objection: Even if this be a eulogy, is it not contradictory to say, 'even by killing he does not kill'?
Reply: This defect does not arise; for this becomes logical from the ordinary and the enlightened points of view. By adopting the empirical point of view (which consists in thinking), 'I am the slayer', by identifying the body with the Self, the Lord says, 'even by killing'; and, by taking His stand on the supreme Truth as explained above (the Lord says), 'he does not kill, nor does he become bound'. Thus both these surely become reasonable.
Objection; Is it not that the Self certainly does act in combination with the locus etc., which conclusion follows from the use of the word kevala (absolute) in the text, 'the absolute Self as the agent' (16)?
Reply: There is not such fault, because, the Self being changeless by nature, there is no possiblity of Its becoming united with the locus etc. For it is only a changeful entity that can possibly be united with another, or come to have agentship through combination. But, for the changeless Self there can be no combination with anything whatsoever. Hence, agentship through combination is not logical. Therefore, the absoluteness of the Self being natural, the word kevalam is merely a reiteration of an established fact.
And the changelessness of the Self is well known from the Upanisads, the Smrtis and logic. As to that, in the Gita itself this has been established more than once in such texts as, 'It is said that৷৷.This is unchangeable' (2.25), 'Actions are being done by the gunas themselves' (see 3.27), 'this ৷৷.supreme Self does not act৷৷.although existing in the body' (13.31), and in the Upanisads also in such texts as, 'It thinks, as it were, and shakes, as it were' (Br. 4.3.7).
And from the standpoint of reason also, the royal path is to hold that the true nature of the Self is that It is partless, independent of others and changeless. Even if mutability (of the Self) be accepted, It should have a change that is Its own. The functions of the locus etc. cannot be attributed to the agency of the Self. Indeed, an action done by someone else cannot be imputed to another by whom it has not been done! As for what is imputed (on somody) through ignorance, that is not his. As the ality of silver is not of nacre, or as surface or dirt attributed through ignorance to the sky by foolish people is not of the sky, similarly, the changes in the locus etc. also are verily their own, and not of the Self. Hence it has been well said that the enlightened person 'does not kill, nor is he bound', becuase of the absence of his being tainted by the idea that actions are done by himself. [Some translate this portion thus: '৷৷.because of the absence of the thought 'I am doing', and also due to the taintlessness of the mind'; or, '৷৷.in the absence of egotism and of all taint in the mind'.-Tr.]
After having declared, 'This One does not kill, nor is It killed' (2.19); having stated the immutability of the Self through such texts as, 'Never is this One born' (2.20) , etc., which adduce the reason for this; having briefly stated at the commencement of the Scripture-in, 'he who knows this One as indestructible' (2.21)-that the enlightened man has no eligibility for rites and duties; and having deliberated in various places on that (cessation) which has been mooted in the middle (of the Scripture), the Lord, by way of summarizing the purport of the Scripture, concludes here by saying that the enlightened person 'does not kill, nor does he become bound.' If this be so, then it becomes established that the three kinds of results of actions, viz the undesirable etc., do not accrue to the monks, since it is reasonable that, because of the illogicality of their entertaining the idea of being embodied, all actions resulting from ignorance become abandoned (by them). And hence, as a conseence of a reversal of this, it becomes inevitable that the results do accrue to others.
Thus, this is how the purport of the scripture Gita has been summed up. In order that this which is the essence of the teachings of all the Vedas should be. understood after deliberation by the learned ones possessing a sharp intellect, it has been explained by us in accordance with the scriptures and reasoning, in various places by dealing with it topically.
Thereafter, now is being stated what promts actions:
18.18 Knowledge, the knowable and the knower form the threefold impulse to action; the organ, the action and the agent form the threefold basis of action.
18.18 Knowledge, the knower and the object of knowledge, these are the three incentives to action; and the act, the actor and the instrument are the threefold constituents.
18.18. The instrument of knowledge,  the object-of-knowledge, and the knowing subject-the prompting-in-action, consisting of these three-fold elements is [itself] the proper grasping of action with three-fold elements viz., the instrument, the object and the agent.
18.18 Knowledge, object of knowledge and the knower are the threefold incitements to action. The instrument, the act and the agent are the threefold constituents of action.
18.18 Knowledge, the object the knowledge and the knower-this is the threefold inducement to action. The comprehension of actions comes under three heads-the instruments, the object and the subject.
18.18 (i) 'Knowledge' means this knowledge about the acts which ought to be performed. (ii) The 'object of knowledge' is the act which ought to be performed. (iii) 'The knower' is the person who knows that act. The meaning is that the injunction to do acts, like Jyotistoma etc., is a combination of knowledge, object of knowledge, and the knower. Among these, action itself, which is the object of knowledge, is briefly described as threefold - these being the instrument, action and the agent. The instrument forms the materials etc., which are the means. The action consists of the sacrifice etc. The agent is the performer.
18.18 Jnanam etc.  Prompting-in-action :  the will to exert. At that time those things which - because they exist in one's thought alone - are referable by the terms knowledge, obect-of-knowledge and knowing-subject;  at the time of that will (to exert) taking the form  'I shall enjoy it; for it is caused by me'  as well as at the time of executing th act, the very same things-because they are fully absorbed  [in desire for fruits] - get the names instrument, object and agent.  Therefore, because there is no such absorption  [in desire for fruits] in the case of  the men of Yoga, there is  no  room in their action for the expressions instrument etc.; rather they exist only as knowledge etc.  This is the purport here.			
 Now  [the Lord]  speaks to explain, in brief, the classification of all these six items, basing on the classification of the Strands :-
18.18 Jnanam, knowledge (-being derived in the sense of 'that through which something is known', jnana means knowledge concerning all things in general-): so also jneyam, the object of knowledge (-that also is a reference to all objects in general-); similarly, parijnata, the knower, the experiencer, a product of ignorance, who partakes of the nature of the limiting adjuncts;-thus, this tripartite group formed by these is the trividha, threefold; karma-codana, inducement ot action, inducer of all actions in general. For, it is when the three, viz knowledge etc., combine that commencement of all actions meant either for acceptance or rejection [Acceptance, rejection or indifference.] are possible. After that, what are initiated by the five, viz locus etc., and are grouped in three ways according to the differences of their being based on speech, mind and body become comprehended under the three, viz instrument etc. This is what is being stated: Karma-sangrahah, the comprehension [It is well know that actions are based on the three-instrument etc.] of actions; iti, comes under; trividhah, three heads, three classes; viz karanam, the instrument (-derived in the sense of that through which anything is done-), i.e. the external (organs) (ear etc.) and the internal (organs) (intellect etc.); karma, the object (-derivatively meaning that which is most cherished by the subject and is achieved through an act-); and karta, the subject (agent), who employs the instrument etc., who partakes of the nature of the limiting adjuncts.
Sangrahah is derived thus: that in which something is comprehended. The comprehension of action (karma) is karma-sangrahah. Indeed, action becomes included in these three. Hence is this 'threefold comprehension of action'.
Now then, since action, instrument and result are all constituted by the gunas, it becomes necessary to state the three fold variety in them based on the differences among the gunas, viz sattva, rajas and tamas. Hence it is begun:
18.19 Knowledge, action and actor are declared in the science of the Gunas (Sankhya philosophy) to be of three kinds only, according to the distinction of the Gunas. Of these also, hear duly.
18.19 The knowledge, the act and the doer differ according to the Qualities. Listen to this too:
18.19. The instrument of knowledge, the object and the agent are just three kinds because of the differences in the Strands-thus it is declared in enumerating the Strands.  These also you must listen to [from Me]  as they are.
18.19 Knowledge, act and agent are declared in the science of Gunas to be of three kinds, according to the difference in the Gunas. Listen about them also as they are.
18.19 Knowledge, action and agent are stated in the teaching about the gunas to be only of three kinds according to the differences of the gunas. Hear about them also as they are.
18.19 The knowledge of action which ought to be done, the act to be performed, and the performer of the act are threefold, each of them being divided in accordance with Sattva etc., Listen about these, which are differentiated according to the Gunas.
18.19 Jnanam etc.  In enumerating the Strands :  In the consdered conclusion of the Sankhya  where the Strands are decided numerically, these instruments of  knowledge etc., are declared to be of three types.  that you must listen to.  This is what is  conveyed by the association of words  (or ideas)  here.  By instrument-of-knowledge  (Jnanam)  the two-fold instruments viz. that of knowledge and of activity, are spoken of.  Similarly object (karman)  speaks of both the object of knowledge and  the object of activity and agent  (kartr) refers to both the knower and the performer.								
 Now the three verses.  Sarvabhutesu etc.  (20-22) speak of the three-foldness of the instrument of knowledge.  That is why the Instrumental Yena is employed.  The nature of all the instruments of knowledge and of action is described by this much of portion.  The three-foldness of object of both the types viz.  the object of knowledge and the object of action is described by the tripple verses Niyatam etc.  (23-25).  The three-fold nature of the agent of both the categories viz.  the knower and the doer is briefly explained by the three verses  Muktasangah etc.  (26-28).  The three types of the intellect is examined by three verses,  Pravrttim etc.  (30-32), in order to explain the different nature of   the two-fold   instruments  (i.e. of knowledge and of action). By this means the three-fold nature of other instrumetns is also indicated.  The instrument reires technical  know-how, and this technical know-how, of course, consists of the pentad that includes content and so on.  However, because faith [included in this pentad]  has already been dealt with  (XVII, 2ff.), and because the desire to know and the aversion to know [both belonging to the pentad] are obtained by inference through the firmness and happiness [of the pentad],  the three-fold division of the last two is explained by the verses  Dhrtya yaya etc. (33-35) and Sukham tu idanim etc.  (36-39).  All this [the Lord] declares [one by one] ;-
18.19 Jnanam, knowledge; karma, action-not the objective case in the technical sense, which is defined as 'that which is most cheirshed by the subject'; and karta, agent, the accomplisher of actions; procyate, are stated; guna-sankhyane, in the teaching about the gunas, in the philosophy of Kapila; to be eva, only (-only is used for emphasis, by way of showing that they have no classification other than that based on the gunas-); tridha, of three kinds; guna-bhedatah, according to the differences of the gunas, i.e. according to the differences of sattva etc.
Even that philosophy teaching about the gunas is certainly vaild so far as it concerns the experiencer of the gunas, though it is contradictory so far as the non-duality of the supreme Reality, Brahman, is concerned. Those followers of Kapila are acknoweldge authorities in the ascertainment of the functions of the gunas and their derivatives. Hence, that scripture, too, is being referred to by way of eulogy of the subject-matter going to be spoken of. Therefore there is no contradiction.
Srnu, hear; tani, about them; api, also; yathavat, as they are, as established by reason and as propounded in the scriptures. Hear about knowledge etc. and all their diversities created by the differences of the gunas. The idea is , 'Concentrate your mind on the subject going to be taught.'
And now the threefold classification of knowledge is being stated:
18.2 The Blessed Lord said  The sages understand Sannyasa to be the renunciation of action with desire; the wise declare the abandonment of the fruits of all actions as Tyaga.
18.2 Lord Shri Krishna replied: The sages say that renunciation means forgoing an action which springs from desire; and relinquishing means the surrender of its fruit.
18.2. The Bhagavat said  The seers understand the act of renouncing the desire-motivated actions as renunciation; the experts declare the relinishment of the fruits of all actions to be relinishment.
18.2 The Lord said  The sages hold that Sannyasa is the giving up of all works which are motivated by desire. The wise declare Tyaga to be the abandonment of fruits of all works.
18.2 The Blessed Lord said  The learned ones know sannyasa to be the giving up of actions done with a desire for reward. The adepts call the abandonment of the results of all works as tyaga.
18.2 The Lord said  Some scholars understand that Sannyasa is complete relinishment of desire-prompted acts. Some other wise men say that the meaning of the term Tyaga, according to the Sastras dealing with release, is relinishment of the fruits not only of all desiderative (Kamya), but also of obligatory and occasional, duties . Here, the problem is, whether the Tyaga taught in the Sastras concern desiderative acts themselves, or fruits of all acts. Sri Krsna has used the terms Sannyasa in one place and Tyaga elsewhere. From this it is understood that Sri Krsna uses the terms Tyaga and Sannyasa as synonyms.

Likewise, the decisive teaching is about Tyaga alone in the statement:  'Hear My decision, O Arjuna, about Tyaga' (18.4). That the terms are synonymously used to denote the same sense, is conclusively established from such passages as:  'But the renunciation (Sannyasa) of obligatory work is not proper. Abandonment (Tyaga) of it through delusion is declared to be Tamasika' (18.7); and 'To those who have not renounced the fruits of actions, threefold are the conseences after death - undesirable, desriable and mixed. But to those who have renounced, none whatsoever' (18.12).
18.2 Kamyanam etc.  The desire-motivated actions : the Agnistoma (sacrifce) etc.  All actions etc. :  The relinishment is the relinishment  of  fruits, even while performing all actions tha are to be performed daily or occasionally.  Whatever remains to be spoken in this chapter had been examined in detail even by the previous commentators like the revered Bhatta Bhaskara and others.  Hence why should we take the trouble of repeating.  For, our main concern is to fulfil the promise to show only the hidden purport of this [work].			
 Therefore now [the Bhagavat] relates different views in order to determine the best in this regard -
18.2 Some kavayah, learned ones; viduh, know; sannyasam, sannyasa, the meaning of the word sannyasa, the non-performance of what comes as a duty; to be the nyasam, giving up; karmanam, of actions; kamyanam, done with a desire for reward, e.g. Horse-sacrifice etc. Sarva-karma-phala-tyagah, abandonment of the results of all actions, means the giving up of the results accruing to oneself from all actions- the daily obligatory and the occasional (nitya and naimittika) that are performed. Vicaksanah, the adepts, the learned ones; prahuh, call, speak of that; as tyagam, tyaga, as the meaning of the word tyaga.
Even if 'the giving up of actions for desired results' or 'the abandonment of results' be the intended meaning, in either case the one meaning of the words sannyasa and tyaga amounts only to tyaga (giving up); they do not imply distinct categories as do the words 'pot' and 'cloth'.
Objection: Well, is it not that they say the daily obligatory (nitya) and the occasional (naimittika) rites and duties have no results at all? How is the giving up of their results spoken of-like the abandoning of a son of a barren woman?!
Reply: This defect does not desire. It is the intention of the Lord that the nitya-karmas (daily obligatory duties) also have results; for the Lord will say, 'The threefold results of actions-the undesirable, the desirable and the mixed-accrue after death to those who do not resort to tyaga', and also, 'but never to those who resort to sannyasa (monks)' (12). Indeed, by showing that, it is only in the case of sannyasins (monks) alone that there is no connection with the results of actions, the Lord asserts in, '৷৷.accrue after death to those who do not resort to tyaga (renunciation)' (abid.), that the result of daily obligatory (nitya) duties accrue to those who are not sannyasins (monks).
18.20 That by which one sees the one indestructible Reality in all beings, not separate in all the separate beings  know thou that knowledge to be Sattvic.
18.20 That knowledge which sees the One Indestructible in all beings, the One Indivisible in all separate lives, may be truly called Pure Knowledge.
18.20. That instrument-of-knowledge, by means of which one perceives in all beings the singular immutable Existence, the Unclassified in the classified ones - that you must know to be born of  the Sattva (Strand).
18.20 Know that Knowledge to be Sattvika by which one sees in all beings, one immutable existence undivided in the divided.
18.20 Know that knowledge to be originating from sattva through which one sees a single, undecaying, undivided Entity in all the diversified things.
18.20 The self (Atman), which is of the form of knowledge, is alike and uniform, though distinct, in all beings, even though they may externally, and from the point of view of duty, be distinguished as Brahmanas, Ksatriyas, householders, celibates, fair, tall etc. The immutable selves in all these perishing forms or bodies are unaffected by the fruits of actions. Such knowledge of the immutability of the self in all changing beings, is Sattvika.
18.20 See Comment under 18.22
18.20 Viddhi, know; tat, that; jnanam, knowledge, realization of the Self as non-dual, complete realization; to be sattvikam, originating from sattva; yena, through which knowledge; iksate, one sees; ekam, a single; avyayam, undecaying-that which does not undergo mutation either in itself or by the mutation of its alities-' i.e. eternal and immutable; bhavam, Entity-the word bhava is used to imply an entity-, i.e. the single Reality which is the Self; sarvabhutesu, in all things, in all things begining from the Unmanifest to the unmoving things; and through which knowledge one sees that Entity to be avibhaktam, undivided; in every body, vibhaktesu, in all the deversified things, in the different bodies. The idea is: that Reality which is the Self remains, like Space, undivided.
Being based on rajas and tamas, those that are the dualistic philosophies are incomplete, and hence are not by themselves adeate for the eradication of worldly existence.
18.21 But that knowledge which sees in all beings various entities of distinct kinds as different from one another  know thou that knowledge to be Rajasic.
18.21 The knowledge which thinks of the manifold existence in all beings as separate - that comes from Passion.
18.21. That instrument-of-knowledge, by means of which one considers the varied natures of different sorts in all beings as [really] different-that is regarded to be of the Rajas (Strand).
18.21 But that knowledge which sees all beings, by reason of their individuality, as entities of distinct nature - know that knowledge to be Rajasika.
18.21 But know that knowledge to be originating from rajas which, amidst all things, apprehends the different entities of various kinds as distinct [As possessing distinct selves.].
18.21 Whatever knowledge perceives in Brahmana etc., at the time of work, the entity known as the Atman as of diverse nature because the bodies of those beings are tall or fair and are fit to attain the fruits of work - know that knowledge to be Rajasika. The point is this:  It is not a condemnation of the plurality of Atman. The Atman, though distinct, is uniform everywhere. The bodily attributes do not affect it. The knowledge lacking this understanding is stigmatised as Rajasa.
18.21 See Comment under 18.22
18.21 Tu, but; viddhi, know; tat, that; jnanam, knowledge; to be rajasam, originating from rajas; yat, which; sarvesu bhutesu, amidst all things; vetti, apprehends-since knowledge cannot be an agent of hends-since knowledge cannot be an agent of action, therefore the meaning implied is, 'that, knowledge৷৷.through which one apprehends৷৷.'-; nana-bhavan, the different entities; prthagvidhan, of various kinds, i.e., those possessing diverse characteristics and different from oneself; prthakrvena, as distinct, as separate in each body.
18.22 But that which clings to one single effect as if it were the whole, without reason, without foundation in Truth, and trivial  that is declared to be Tamasic.
18.22 But that which clings blindly to one idea as if it were all, without logic, truth or insight, that has its origin in Darkness.
18.22. That  [instrument-of-knowledge], because of which, one, not realising the whole, gets indulged, without  reason, in a particular activity, and which is unconcerned with the real nature of things and is insignificant - that is declared to be of the Tamas (Strand).
18.22 But that knowledge is declared to be Tamasika which clings to one single act as if it were the whole, which is not founded on reason, and which is untrue and insignificant.
18.22 But that (knowledge) is said to be born of tamas which is confined to one form as though it were all, which is irrational, not concern with truth and triivial.
18.22 But that knowledge which clings to a 'single type of act' as what ought to be done, viz., act in the form of the worship of ghosts or evil spirits yielding very small fruits, as if it yielded all fruits; that work 'not founded on any reason for having attachment,' because it is not a source of all fruits; 'untrue' because it is based on a false view of things such as seeing differentiation in the nature of the Atman; 'insignificant', because the worship of ghosts and evil spirits yields poor results - for such reasons knowledge of this kind is declared to be Tamasika.

After having thus classified the threefold division of knowledge relating to work according to Gunas in respect of a person who is alified for work, Sri Krsna explains the triple division of the acts that ought to be done, according to Gunas.
18-20-22 Sarvabhutesu etc. upto samudahrtam.  In the classified ones : i.e.,  [classified] as gods, human beings, etc.  Considers as [really] different :  i.e., with the thought  'Here on this depends my pleasure; here in that lies my displeasure'.  Without reason :  To take recourse to wrath, desire etc., slavishly under the influence of one's own addiction and also without examining the cause, in named as a thing born of the Tamas (Strand).
18.22 But tat, that knowledge; is udahrtam, said to be; tamasam, born of tamas; yat, which is; saktam, confined; ekasmin, to one; karye, from, to one body or to an external image etc., krtsnavat, as though it were all, as though it comprehended everything, thinking, 'The Self, or God, is only this much; there is nothing beyond it,'-as the naked Jainas hold that the soul conforms to and has the size of the body, or (as others hold) that God is merely a stone or wood-, remaining confined thus to one form; ahaitukam, which is irrational, bereft of logic; a-tattvarthavat, not concerned with truth-tattvartha, truth, means some-thing just as it is; that (knowledge) which has this (truth) as its object of comprehension is tattvarthavat; that without this is ; a-tattvarthavat-; and which, on account of the very fact of its being irrational, is alpam, trivial, because it is concerned with trifles or is productive of little result. This kind of knowledge is indeed found in non-discriminating creatures in whom tamas predominates.
Now is being stated the threehold division of action:
18.23 An action which is ordained, which is free from attachment, and which is done without love or hatred by one who is not desirous of any reward  that action is declared to be Sattvic.
18.23 An obligatory action done by one who is disinterested, who neither likes nor dislikes it, and gives no thought to the consequences that follow, such an action is Pure.
18.23. The  object that has been acired with determination, without attachment and without desire or hatred, by one who does not crave to reap the fruit  [of his action] - that is declared to be of the Sattva (Strand).
18.23 That obligatory act is said to be Sattvika which is done without attachment, without desire or aversion, by one who seeks no fruit.
18.23 The daily obligatory action which is performed without attachment and without likes or dislikes by one who does not hanker for rewards, that is said to be born of sattva.
18.23 'Obligatory act' is that which is appropriate to one's own station and stage of life. Doing it 'without attachment' means devoid of attachment to agency etc., and 'without desire or aversion' means that it is not done through desire to win fame and aversion to win notoriety, i.e., is performed without ostentation - when obligatory works are performed in the above-mentioned way by one who is not after their fruits, they are said to be Sattvika.
18.23 See Comment under 18.25
18.23 Niyatam, the daily obligatory; karma, action; yat, which; is krtam, performed; sanga-rahitam, without attachment; araga-dvesatah, without likes or dislikes; aphala-prepsuna, by one who does not hanker for rewards, by an agent who is the opposite of one who is desirous of the fruits of action; tat, that (action); ucyate, is said to be; sattvikam, born of sattva.
18.24 But that action which is done by one longing for the fulfilment of desires or gain with egoism or with much effort  that is declared to be Rajasic (passionate).
18.24 But even though an action involve the most strenuous endeavour, yet if the doer is seeking to gratify his desires, and is filled with personal vanity, it may be assumed to originate in Passion.
18.24. The object which is abundant in afflictions; and which is further reired by one who craves to attain the desired thing with the feeling of  'I'-that is considered to be of the Rajas (Strand).
18.24 But that act is said to be Rajasika which is performed with great effort by one who seeks to gratify his desires and under the prompting of egoism.
18.24 But that action is said to be born of rajas which is done by one desirous of results or by one who is egotistic, and which is highly strenuous.
18.24 But whatever act is performed by one who seeks to gratify his desires, viz., by one who desires the results of his action and with the feeling of egoism, viz., has the misconceived notion that oneself is the agent; and with a great deal of effort - such an act is of the nature of Rajas. Here va (or) is used in the sense of ca (and). Whatever action is performed by one who possesses the misconceived notion, 'This action demanding enormous effort is performed entirely by me' - it is said to be Rajasika.
18.24 See Comment under 18.25
18.24 But tat, that; karma, action; udahrtam, is said to be; rajasam, born of rajas; yat, which; is kriyate, done; kamepsuna by one desirous of results; va, or; saahankarena, by one who is egotistic; and bahulaayasam, which is highly strenuous, accomplished by the agent with great effort.
'Egotistic' is not used in contrast to knowledge of Truth. What then? It is used in contrast to the absence of egotism in an ordinary person versed in the Vedic path. For in the case of the knower of the Self, who is not egotistic in the real sense, there is no estion of his being desirous of results or of being an agent of actions reiring great effort. Even of actions born of sattva, the agent is one who has not realized the Self and is possessed of egoism; what to speak of actions born of rajas and tamas! In common parlance, a person versed in the Vedic path, even though not possessing knowledge of the Self, is spoken of as being free from egotism thus-'This Brahmana is free from egotism'. Therefore, 'sahan-karena va' is said in contrast to him only. Punah (again) is used to complete the meter.
18.25 That action which is undertaken from delusion, without a regard for the conseences, loss, injury and (one's own) ability  that is declared to be Tamasic (dark).
18.25 An action undertaken through delusion, and with no regard to the spiritual issues involved, or the real capacity of the doer, or to the injury which may follow, such an act may be assumed to be the product of Ignorance.
18.25. The object which is gained, due to ignorance, without  considering the result, the loss, the injury to others and the strength  [of one's own]-that is declared to be of the Tamas (Strand).
18.25 That act is said to be Tamasika which is undertaken through delusion, without regard to conseences, loss, injury and one's own capacity.
18.25 That action is said to be born of tamas which is undertaken out of delusion, (and) without consideration of its conseence, loss, harm and ability.
18.25 'Anubandha' or conseence is here the pain which follows when a work is performed. 'Loss' means loss of wealth involved in doing that act. 'Injury' is the pain caused to living beings when the work is carried out. 'Capacity' is the ability of completing the act. Whenever an act is begun without consideration of these and from delusion, viz., due to ignoring the agency of the Supreme Person - that act is said to be Tamasika.
18.23-25 Niyatam etc. :  upto Tamasam ucyate.  With determination :  i.e., it is a thing to be acired.  Abundant in offlictions :  spread through by nescience etc.  Due to ignorance : i.e. due to that which is born of addiction.
18.25 Tat, that; karma, action; yat, which; is arabhyate, undertaken; mohat, out of delusion, non-discrimination; anapeksya, without consideration of; its anubandham, conseence, the result which accrues later; ksayam, loss-that losss which is incurred in the form of loss of energy or loss of wealth in the course of any action; himsam, harm, suffering to creatures; and paurusam, ability, prowess-one's own ability fest as, 'I shall be able to complete this task';-without consideration of these, from 'conseence' to 'ability', ucyate, is said to be; tamasam, born of tamas.
18.26 An agent who is free from attachment, non-egoistic, endowed with firmness and enthusiasm, and unaffected by success or failure, is called Sattvic (pure).
18.26 But when a man has no sentiment and no personal vanity, when he possesses courage and confidence, cares not whether he succeeds or fails, then his action arises from Purity.
18.26. The agent who is free from attachment; who does not make any speech of egoism; who is full of contentment and enthusiasm; and who does not change [mentally]  in success or in failure-that agent is said  to be of the Sattva (Strand) nature.
18.26 That agent is said to be Sattvika who is free from attachment, who does not make much of himself, who is endued with steadiness and zeal and is untouched by success and failure.
18.26 [Ast. introduces this verse with 'Idanim kartrbhedah ucyate, Now is being stated the distinctions among the agents.'-Tr.] The agent who is free from attachment [Attachment to results or the idea of agentship.], not egotistic, endowed with fortitude and diligence, and unperturbed by success and failure is said to be possessed of sattva.
18.26 'Muktasangah' is one who is free from attachment to fruits. 'Anahamvadi' is one who is devoid of the feeling of being the agent. He is endued with 'steadiness and zeal.' 'Steadiness' is perseverance in regard to an act that has been begun in spite of the pain that is inevitable till the completion of the work. 'Zeal' is the possession of an active mind. One who is enduded with these, and whose mind remains firm, untouched by success and failure in war etc., and also in gathering the material reisities for the work on hand - such an agent is, of Sattvika nature.
18.26 See Comment under 18.28
18.26 Karta, the agent; who is mukta-sangah, free from attachment-one by whom attachment has been given up; anahamvadi, not egotisic, not given to asserting his ego; dhrti-utsaha-samanvitah, endowed with fortitude and diligenc; and nirvikarah, unperturbed; siddhi-asiddhyoh, by success and failure, in the fruition and non-fruition of any action under-taken-led only by the authority of the scriptures, not by attachment to results etc. [Etc. stands for attachment to work.];-the agent who is such, he is ucyate, said to be; sattvikah, possessed of sattva.
18.27 Passionate, desiring to obtain the reward of actions, greedy, cruel, impure, moved by joy and sorrow, such an agent is said to be Rajasic (passionate).
18.27 In him who is impulsive, greedy, looking for reward, violent, impure, torn between joy and sorrow,it may be assumed that in him Passion is predominant.
18.27. The agent, who is a man of passion; who craves for the fruit of his action, and is avaricious; who is injurious by nature, is impure and is overpowered by joy and griefthat agent is proclaimed to be of the Rajas (Strand).
18.27 That doer is called Rajasika who is passionate, who seeks the fruits of his acts, who is greedy, harmful, impure and who is moved by delight and grief.
18.27 The agent who has attachment, who is desirous of the results of actions, covetous, cruel by nature, unclean and subject to joy and sorrow is declared to be possessed of rajas.
18.27 The 'passionate' doer is one who aspires for fame; 'who seeks the fruits of his acts' is one who longs for the fruits of his acts; the 'greedy' is he who does not spend the wealth reired for the act; the 'harmful' is one, who while acting, hurts others; the 'impure', is one who lacks the purity reired for the act; who is moved by 'delight and grief' in war etc., is one who is elated or depressed by success or failure in victory (or the opposite) - a doer who fulfils these conditions is declared to be Rajasika.

18.27 Karta, the agent; ragi, who has attachment; karma-phala-prepsuh, who is desirous of the results of actions; lubdhah, covetous, greedy for other's property, and does not part with his own (when) at holy places; himsatmakah, cruel by nature, having a nature that cuases pain to others; asucih, unclean, devoid of internal and external cleanliness; and harsa-soka-anvitah, subject to joy and sorrow, affected by these two, joy and sorrow-joy at the acisition of desired objects, sorrow at getting undesired objects and losing coverted objects; and elation and dejection may occur to that very person from his actions being aided or hindered; one who is subject to those-; parikirtitah, is declared to be; rajasah, possessed of rajas.
18.28 Unsteady, vulgar, unbending, cheating, malicious, lazy, desponding and procrastinating  such an agent is called Tamasic.
18.28 While he whose purpose is infirm, who is low-minded, stubborn, dishonest, malicious, indolent, despondent, procrastinating - he may be assumed to be in Darkness.
18.28. The agent, who does not exert, is vulgar, obstinate and deceitful; who is a man of wickedness and is lazy, sorrowful, and procrastinating - that agent is said to be of the Tamas (Strand).
18.28 That doer is said to be Tamasika who is unalified, unrefined, stubborn, depraved, dishonest, indolent, despondent and dilatory.
18.28 The agent who is unsteady, naive, unbending, deceitful, wicked, [A variant reading is naikrtikah.-Tr.] lazy, morose and procrastinating is said to be possessed of tamas.
18.28 'Ayukta' is the doer who is unalified for acts enjoined by the Sastras; the meaning is that he is engaged in perverse acts; who is 'unrefined', means one uninstructed; who is 'stubborn', means one who is not disposed to act; who is 'depraved' means one who has the taste for black magic etc; who is dishonest is one who is treacherous; who is 'indolent' is one who is not inclined to carry out actions undertaken; who is 'despondent' is one given to excessive despondency; and one who is 'dilatory', is a person who, while engaged in black magic, etc., pays malevolent attention to produce long-standing evil to others - such a doer is declared to be Tamasika.

Thus, has been told the threefold division in terms of the Gunas of the knowledge about the work that ought to be performed, and about the agent of work. Now, Sri Krsna describe s the threefold division of Buddhi and Dhrti (fortitude) on the basis of Gunas. These faculties give the determinate knowledge of all realities in existence and of all ends of human life (Purusarthas).
18.26-28 Muktasangah etc. upto  Tamasa ucyate.  He who does not make speech of egoism :  He who does not claim  'I am the agent' i.e., he who is different from the one who claims so by natural inclination, or claims as such with an intention that 'I should do so',   or claims so in an efficient manner.  This nini (suffix employed in anahamvadi) does not prohibit for a Yogin, the speech  'I do' under the influence of the cover of the mundane life.  Who is overpowered by joy and grief : i.e., at the time of success and failure  [respectively].  Wickedness :  cruelty.
18.28 The agent who is ayuktah, unsteady; prakrtah, naive, of very unrefined intelligence, like a child; stabdhah, unbending like a staff-he does not bend down to anyone; sathah, deceitful, cunning, hiding his own powers; naiskrtikah, wicked, given to destroying the livelihood of others; alasah, lazy, not inclined even to his own duties; visadi, morose, ever in a mood of dejection; and dirghasutri, procrastinating, postponing duties for long, [Ast. adds here, 'sarvada mandasvabhavah, always slow by nature'.-Tr.] not accomplishing even in a month what is to be done today or tomorrow;-one who is such, he ucyate, is said to be; tamasah, possessed of tamas.
18.29 Hear thou the threefold division of intellect and firmness according to the Gunas, as I declare them fully and distinctly, O Arjuna.
18.29 Reason and conviction are threefold, according to the Quality which is dominant. I will explain them fully and severally, O Arjuna!
18.29. You must listen [from Me] to the three-fold division of the intellect and also of content both being expounded completely and individually,  [by Me] basing on the Strands, O Dhananjaya !
18.29 Hear now, the threefold division of Buddhi (reason) and Dhrti (fortitude), O Arjuna, according to the Gunas, fully and severally to be set forth.
18.29 O Dhananjaya, listen to the classification of the intellect as also of fortitude, which is threefold according to the gunas, while it is being stated elaborately and severally.
18.29 'Buddhi' is the knowledge in the form of discriminative determination. 'Dhrti' is the resolution to hold on with perseverance to what has been undertaken even against all obstacles. Of these two, hear now the threefold division according to Sattva and other Gunas.
18.29 Buddheh etc.  Intellect :  the faculty of resolving.  Content :  satisfaction.  After having performed either good or wicked action, everyone, at the end, feels  'what is to be necessarily performed  has been performed;  so why furhter more ?'  Or else what could be the cause for [one's]  retiring from that action ?' Therefore in every one there is content.  This is the meaning intended here.  The word-meaning, that is not clearly known-that alone is certainly explained [hereinafter].
18.29 O Dhananjaya, srnu, listen; bhedam, to the classification; buddheh, of the intellect; ca eva, as also; the classification dhrteh, of fortitude; trividham, which is threefold; gunatah, according to the gunas, sattva etc. -this much is an apporistic statement-; procyamanam, while it is being stated; asesena, elaborately, just as it is, without omitting anything; and prthaktvena, severally.
Arjuna is called Dhananjaya because, in the course of his expedition to coner all the qaurters. he won immense human and divine wealth (dhana).
18.3 Some philosophers declare that actions should be abandoned as an evil; while others (declare) that acts of sacrifice, gift and austerity should not be relinished.
18.3 Some philosophers say that all action is evil and should be abandoned. Others that acts of sacrifice, benevolence and austerity should not be given up.
18.3. Certain wise men delcare that the harmful action is to be relinished while others say that the actions of performing sacrifices, giving gifts and observing austerities should not be relinished.
18.3 Some sages say that all actions should be given up as evil; others declare that works such as sacrifices, gifts and austerities should not be given up.
18.3 Some learned persons say that action, beset with evil (as it is), should be given up, and others (say) that the practice of sacrifice, charity and austertiy should not be given up.
18.3 Some sages, viz., the adherents of Kapila and those Vaidikas who agree with his creed, contend that all acts such as sacrifices etc., should be renounced by aspirants for release, as they bind even as desires and other similar defects tend to bind. Other learned men say that acts like sacrifices etc., should not be renounced.
18.3 Tyajyam etc.  The harmful :  that which is connected with sin, becuase it consists of act of injury etc.  Such an action must be relinished and not all aciton that has auspicious result.  In this way certain persons-as if they are attached  (as domesticated animals do )  to the house of the Sankhyas - think of a distinction is relinishing.  But there are other learned persons who put on the coat of the Mimamsakas and who, basing exclusively the scriptures, classify what action to be performed and what action not to be performed .  They opine :  The act of killing that constitutes the technical aspect of execution of a sacrifice is [in fact] not an act of injury at all in view of the principles, like
 
'The action intended for sacrifice is indeed known from the scripture only' - (SB, IV, i, 2)
 and  
'Therefore the act of injury known from the Vedas' etc. - (SV, I, i, 2.23)
 
For, the general rule 'Don't injure' is  annulled in  this case.  But, at the same time the Syena-sacrifice etc., is an act of killing.  Becuase,
 
'The injunctive suffix does not prescribe what falls within the purveiw of fruit of an action of the injunction.'  [SV, I, i, 2.222).
 
Therefore other [Vedic] sacrifices one should not relinish eventhough they are connected with an act of injury.
18.3 Eke, some; manisinah, learned ones, subscribing to the views of the Sankhyas and others; prahuh, say; that dosavat, beset with evil (as it is);-What is it?- karma, action, all actions, becuase they are the cause of bondage; tyajyam, should be given up even by those who are eligible for actions (rites and duties). Or, it (action) is to be given up dosavat, just as defects such as attachment etc. are renounced. Ca and, in that very context; apare, others; (say) that yajana-dana-tapah-karma, the practice of sacrifice, charity and auterity; na tyajyam, should not be given up. 
These alternatives are with regard to only those who are alified for action, but not with regard to the monks who are steadfast in Knowledge and have gone beyond the stages of life. This discussion is not concerned with those who are held to be outside the scope of eligibility for action in the assertion (by the Lord), 'The steadfastness in the Yoga of Knowledge by men of realization was spoken of by Me in the days of yore' (see 3.3).
Objection: Well, just as those who are alified for rites and duties and who have their distinct steadfastness are being considered here in the chapter summarizing the entire scripture, though they have been dealt with earlier in '৷৷.through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' (3.3), similarly, let even the men of realization who are steadfast in Knowledge be considered here.
Reply: No, because it is not logical that their renunciation should result from delusion and sorrow (cf. 7 and 8). The men of realization do not perceive in the Self the sorrows arising from physical torment; for it has been shown that desire etc. are attributes only of the field (body) (see 13.6). Therefore, they do not renounce action but of fear for physical trouble and pain. Nor do they perceive actions in the Self, on account of which they should give up obligatory duties out of delusion. In fact, they renounce with the conviction that 'action belongs to the organs' (see 3.28); 'I certainly do not do anything' (see 5.8); for, the mode of renunciation of an enlightened person was shown in, '৷৷.having given up all actions mentally' (5.13). Therefore, those others who are alified for rites and duties, who are unelightened about the Self, and for whom renunciation is possible out of delusion and from fear of physical trouble, are alone condemned as persons who, being possessed of tamas and rajas, resort to renunciation. And this is done with a veiw to eulogizing the renunciation of the results of rites and duties by the unenlightened men of action.
Besides, the men of renunciation in the real sense have been particularly pointed out in, 'who has renounced ever undertaking,' 'who is silent, content with anything, homeless, steadyminded' (12.16, 19), and also (while determining) the characteristics of one who has transcended the gunas (Chapter 14). The Lord will further say, '৷৷.which is the supreme consummation of Knowledge' (50). Therefore the monks steadfast in Knowledge are not intended to be spoken of here. It is only the abandoning of the results of action which, by virtue of its being imbued with the ality of sattva, is spoken of as sannyasa in contrast to the renunciation of actions which is possessed of tamas etc.; it is not sannyasa in the primary-sense-the renunciation of all actions.
Objection: According to the reason shown in the text, 'Since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body to give up actions entirely' (11), may it not be argued that the actions entirely' (11), may it not be argued that the word sannyasa is certainly used in the primary sense because it is impossible to abandon all works?
Reply: No, for the next adducing the reason is meant for eulogy. Just as, 'From renunciation immediately (follows) Peace' (12.12), is a mere eulogy of renunciation of the fruits of action, it having been enjoined on Arjuna who was unenlightened and incapable of undertaking the various alternatives (paths) as stated earlier, so also is this sentence, 'Since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body to give up actions entirely' (11), meant for eulogizing the renunciation of the resorts of all actions. No one can point an exception to the proposition that 'having given up all actions mentally, (the embodied man of self-control) continues happily৷৷.without doing or causing (others) to do anything at all' (see 5.13). Therefore these alternative veiws regarding sannyasa and tyaga are concerned only with those who are alified for rites and duties. But the enlightened ones who have realized the supreme Truth are competent only for steadfastness in Knowledge, which is characterized by renunciation of all actions; not for anything else. Hence, they do not come within the purview of the alternative veiws. Thus has this been pointed out by us in connection with the text, '৷৷.he who knows this One as indestructible৷৷.' (2.21) as also in the beginning of the third chapter.
18.30 The intellect which knows the path of work and renunciation, what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, fear and fearlessness, bondage and liberation  that intellect is Sattvic (pure), O Arjuna.
18.30 That intellect which understands the creation and dissolution of life, what actions should be done and what not, which discriminates between fear and fearlessness, bondage and deliverance, that is Pure.
18.30. The intellect which knows the activity and the cessation from the activity, the proper and improper actions, the fear and non-fear, and the bondage and emancipation-that intellect is considered to be of the Sattva (Strand).
18.30 That Buddhi, O Arjuna, which knows activity and renunciation, what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, fear and fearlessness, bondage and release - that (Buddhi) is Sattvika.
18.30 O Partha, that intellect is born of sattva which understands action and withdrawal, duty and what is not duty, the sources of fear and fearlessness, and bondage and freedom.
18.30 'Activity' is that Dharma which is the means for wordly prosperity. 'Renunciation' is that Dharma which is the means for release. The Buddhi which knows both these as they are, is Sattviki-buddhi. Further, such a Buddhi is capable of distinguishing between what ought to be done and what ought not to be done by persons of different stations in life, having as their duty activity or renunciation at particular places or times. Such a Buddhi helps them to know 'This ought to be done and this ought not to be done.' Such a Buddhi discerns transgression of the Sastras as the cause of fear and observance of the Sastras as the cause of fearlessness. It enables one to distinguish between bondage and release, the true nature of Samsara and deliverance from it. The Buddhi that functions in these ways is Sattvika.
18.30 See Comment under 18.32
18.30 O Partha, sa, that; buddhih, intellect; is sattviki, born of sattva; ya, which; vetti, understands; pravrttim, action, the path of rites and duties, which is the cause of bondage; and nivrttim, withdrawal, the path of renunciation, which is the cause of Liberation-since action and withdrawal are mentioned in the same sentence along with bondage and freedom, therefore they mean 'the path of rites and duties and of renunciation'-; karya-akarye, duty and what is not duty, i.e. what is enjoined or prohibited, [Ast. adds laukike vaidike va (ordinary or Vedic injunctions and prohibitions) after vihita-pratisiddhe; and it adds sastrabuddheh before kartavya-akartavye-what ougth to be done or ought not to be done by one who relies on the scriptures.-Tr.] what ought to be done or ought not to be done, action and inaction. With regard to what? With regard to action leading to seen or unseen, results, undertaken according to place, time, etc. Bhaya-adhaye, the sources of fear and fearlessness, i.e. the cuases of fear and fearlessness, with regard to seen or unseen objects; bandham, bondage, along with its cause; and moksam, freedom, along with its cause.
In this context, knowing is a function of the intellect; but the intellect is the possesser of the function. Fortitude also is only a particular function of the intellect.
18.31 That, by which one wrongly understands Dharma and Adharma and also what ought to be done and what ought not to be done  that intellect, O Arjuna, is Rajasic (passionate).
18.31 The intellect which does not understand what is right and what is wrong, and what should be done and what not, is under the sway of Passion.
18.31. The intellect, by means of which one decides incorrectly  the righteous and the unrighteous ones and what is a proper action and also an improper onethat intellect is of the Rajas (Strand),  O son of  Prtha !
18.31 The Buddhi which gives an erroneous knowledge of Dharma and Adharma (its opposite) and also of what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, O Arjuna, is Rajasika.
18.31 O Partha, that intellect is born of rajas with which one wrongly understands virtue and vice as also what ought to be done and ought not to be done.
18.31 That Buddhi by which one does not know exactly the twofold Dharma previously mentioned and its opposite, and what ought to be done and what ought not to be done by those intent on them in accordance with place, time and conditions - that Buddhi is Rajasika.
18.31 See Comment under 18.32
18.31 O Partha, sa, that; buddhih, intellect; is rajasi, born of rajas; yaya, with which; prajanati, one understands; ayathavat, wrongly, not truly, not by discerning it from all points of view; dharmam, virtue, as prescribed by the scritpures; and adharmam, vice, what is prohibited by them; [By dharma and adharma are implied the seen and the unseen results of actions as revealed by the scriptures; karya and akarya respectively refer to the actual doing of what ought to be done and the not doing of what ought not to be done.] ca eva, as also; karyam, what ought to be done; and akaryam, what ought not to be done-those very 'duty' and 'what is not duty' as stated earlier.
18.32 That, which, enveloped in darkness, sees Adharma as Dharma and all things perverted  that intellect, O Arjuna, is Tamasic (dark).
18.32 And that which, shrouded in Ignorance, thinks wrong right, and sees everything perversely, O Arjuna, that intellect is ruled by Darkness.
18.32. The intellect  which, containing darkness (ignorance), conceives the unrighteous one as righteous and all things topsy-turvy-that intellect is deemed to be of the Tamas (Strand).
18.32 That Buddhi, O Arjuna, which, enveloped in darkness, regards Adharma as Dharma and which reverses every value, is Tamasika.
18.32 O Parhta, that intellect is born of tamas which, being covered by darkness, considers vice as virtue, and verily perceives all things contrary ot what they are.
18.32 That Buddhi is of the nature of Tamas which is 'enveloped in Tamas' and 'reverses every value.' The meaning is that it regards Adharma as Dharma and Dharma as Adharma, existent as non-existent, and non-existent as existent, and higher truth as the lower and the lower truth as the higher, and thus reverses every value.
18.30-32 Pravrttim etc.  upto Tamasi mata.  Incorrectly ;  not properly.
18.32 O Partha, sa, that; buddhih, intellect; tamasi, is born of tamas; ya, which; tamasavrta, being covered by darkness; manyate, considers, understands; adharmam, vice, what is prohibited; iti, as; dharmam, virtue, what is prescribed; and ca, verily; perceives sarvarthan, all things, all objects of knowledge without exception; viparitan, contrary to what they are.
18.33 The unwavering firmness by which, through Yoga, the functions of the mind, the life-force and the senses are restrained  that firmness, O Arjuna, is Sattvic (pure).
18.33 The conviction and steady concentration by which the mind, the vitality and the senses are controlled - O Arjuna! They are the product of Purity.
18.33. The unfailing content because of which one restrains, with  Yoga, the activities of  mind, the living breath and the senses-that content is considered to be of the Sattva (Strand).
18.33 That Dhrti (fortitude or persisting perseverance) by which one maintains the unswerving activities of the mind and vital force and these sense-organs through Yoga - that Dhrti is of the nature of Sattva.
18.33 O Partha, the firmness that is unfailing through concentration, with which one restrains the functions of the mind, vital forces and the organs, that firmness is born of sattva.
18.33 That Dhrti by which one through unswerving Yoga sustains the activities of the mind and the vital force and the sense-organs is said to be of the nature of Sattva. 'Yoga is worship of the Lord which forms the means for release. The meaning is that the Dhrti or fortitude by means of which one sustains the activities of the mind and other organs in the practice of Yoga (worship) until one's object is accomplished, is of the nature of Sattva.
18.33 See Comment under 18.35
18.33 O Partha, dhrtya, the firmness; (-is connected with the remote word) avyabhicarinya, that is unfailing; yogena, through concentration, i.e. (the firmness that is) ever associated with samadhi (absorption in Brahman); yaya, with which; dharayate, one restrains;-what?-manah-prana-indriya-kriyah, the functions of the mind, vital forces and organs-restrains them from tending towards the path opposed to the scriptures-. Indeed, when restrained with firmness, they do not incline towards objects prohibited by the scriptures. Sa, that; dhrtih, firmness, which is of this kind; is sattviki, born of sattva.
What is mean is that when one restrains the functions of the mind, vital forces and organs with unfailing firmness, one does so through yoga, concentration.
18.34 But that, O Arjuna, by which, on account of attachment and desire for reward, one holds fast to Dharma (duty), enjoyment of pleasures and earning of wealth  that firmness, O Arjuna, is Rajasic (passionate).
18.34 The conviction which always holds fast to rituals, to self-interest and wealth, for the sake of what they may bring forth - that comes from Passion.
18.34. O Arjuna !  The content by which one restrains one's bounden duty,  pleasure and wealth, and conseently desiring the fruits [of action]-that content is of the Rajas (Strand),  O son of  Prtha !
18.34 That Dhrti, O Arjuna, by which one, who is desirous of fruits, longs for them with intense attachment, and holds fast to duty, desire and wealth - that Dhrti is Rajasika.
18.34 But, O Partha, the firmness with which one holds on to righteousness, covetable things and wealth, being desirous of their fruits as the occasion for each arises, that firmness is born of rajas.
18.34 That Dhrti by which a person who, desirous of fruits, i.e., through intense attachment holds fast to duty, desires, and wealth, is of the nature of Rajas. By the terms 'Dharma-kam'artha,' the activities of the mind, vital force and senses as a means for the attainment of Dharma (duty) Kama (pleasure) and Artha (wealth) are signified. Even in the expression, 'One desirous of fruits,' that term indicates duty, desire and wealth, on account of the Rajasika nature of the aspirant. Therefore, what is said amounts to this:  the Dhrti by which one maintains activities of the mind etc., with the purpose of attaining duty; desire and wealth, is of the nature of Rajas.
18.34 See Comment under 18.35
18.34 Tu, but, O Partha; the dhrtya, firmness; yaya, with which; a person dharayate, holds on to; dharma-kama-arthan, righteousness, covetable things and wealth-entertains the conviction in the mind that these ought to be pursued always; and becomes phala-akanksi, desirous of their fruits; prasangena, as the occasion for each arises, according as the situation arises for holding on to any one of dharma etc.; sa, that; dhrtih, firmness; is rajasi, born of rajas.
18.35 That, by which a stupid man does not abandon sleep, fear, grief, despair and also conceit  that firmness, O Arjuna, is Tamasic.
18.35 And that which clings perversely to false idealism, fear, grief, despair and vanity is the product of Ignorance.
18.35. The content, whery a foolish man does not give up his sleep, fear, grief, despondency and also arrogancethat content is deemed to be of the Tamas (Strand).
18.35 That Dhrti by which a foolish person does not give up sleep, fear, grief, depression and passion, O Arjuna, is of the nature of Tamas.
18.35 That firmness is considered [Some editions read partha in place of mata (considered).-Tr.] to be born of tamas due to which a person with a corrupt intellect does not give up sleep, fear, sorrow, despondency as also sensuality.
18.35 That Dhrti by which a foolish person does not give up, i.e. persists in, sleep, and sensuous indulgence through the activities of the mind, vital force etc., - that Dhrti is of the nature of Tamas. The terms fear, grief and depression indicate the objects generating fear, grief etc. That Dhrti by which one maintains the activities of the mind, the vital force etc., as a means for these, is of the nature of Tamas.
18.33-35 Dhrtya etc. upto Tamasi mata.  One restrains the activities of his mind, living breath and senses, with Yoga : i.e., thinking  'What is the use for me by enjoying etc. ?  Let me be delighted in the Self by all means.'  Conseently :  not with much indulgence.  That content whery one fixes pleasure as his goal only in sleep, fight etc.-that content is of the Tamas (Strand).
18.35 That firmness is mata, considered to be; tamasi, born of tamas; yaya, due to which; durmedha, a person with a corrupt intellect; na vimuncati, does not give up-indeed, holds fast to; svapnam, sleep; bhayam, fear; sokam, sorrow; visadam, despondency; eva ca, as also; madam, sensuality, enjoyment of objects-mentally holding these as things that must always be resorted to, considering them to be greatly important to himself, like a drunkard thinking of wine.
The threefold division of action as also of agents according to the differences of the gunas has been stated. After that, now is being stated the threefold division of results and happiness:
18.36 And now hear from Me, O Arjuna, of the threefold pleasure, in which one rejoices by practice and surely comes to the end of pain.
18.36 Hear further the three kinds of pleasure. That which increases day after day delivers one from misery,
18.36. O best among the Bharatas !  Now from Me you must also listen to  the three-fold happiness where one gets delighted by practice,  and attains the end of suffering.
18.36 Now hear from Me, O Arjuna, the threefold division of pleasure৷৷. that in which a man rejoices by long practice and in which he comes to the end of pain;
18.36 Now hear from Me, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, as regards the three kinds of joy: That in which one delights owing to habit, and certainly attains the cessation of sorrows; [S. and S.S. take the second line of this verse along with the next verse referring to sattvika happiness.-Tr.]
18.36 Now, hear about the pleasure to which the knowledge, action, agent etc., already mentioned are all subservient and which is threefold according to the Gunas. ৷৷. That pleasure in which a person, through long practice extending over a long time, gradually attains to incomparable joy and never again is engulfed by the pain of life in Samsara.

Sri Krsna explains the same:
18.36 See Comment under 18.39
18.36 Idanim, now; srnu, hear; me, from Me i.e. be attentive to what I say; tu, as regards; the trividham, three kinds of; sukham, joy, O scion of the Bharata dynasty. Yatra, that in which; ramate, one delights, derives pleasure; abhyasat, owing to habit, due to freent repetition; and in the experinece of which joy one nigacchati, certainly attains; duhkhantam, the cessation of sorrow-.
18.37 That which is like poison at first but in the end like nectar  that happiness is declared to be Sattvic, born of the purity of one's own mind due to Self-realisation.
18.37 Which at first seems like poison but afterwards acts like nectar - that pleasure is Pure, for it is born of Wisdom.
18.37. [The happiness] which is like  poison  at its time but is like nectar at the time of its result-that happiness, born of serenity of the Soul and intellect, you must know to be of the Sattva (Strand).
18.37 That which is like a poison at first but becomes like elixir in the end, born from the serene state of mind focusing on the self - such pleasure is said to be Sattvika.
18.37 That which is like poison in the beginning, but comparable to nectar in the end, and which, arises from the purity of one's intellect-that joy is spoken of as born of sattva.
18.37 That pleasure, which 'at the beginning,' i.e., at the time of beginning of Yoga, is 'like poison,' i.e., is painful because it reires strenuous efforts and because the distinct nature of the self is not yet experienced, but which after long practice fructifies in the blissful experience of the self - that joy born of a serene state of mind 'focusing on the self' is Sattvika. The Buddhi concerning the self is 'Atama-buddhi.' When all objects are withdrawn from that Buddhi it becomes serene (Prasanna). The joy born of the experience of the self in its distinct nature, when all objects are withdrawn from the Buddhi, becomes 'like elixir'. That joy is said to be Sattvika.
18.37 See Comment under 18.39
18.37 Yat, that joy which is; iva, like; visam, poison, a source of pain; agre, in the beginning-when it first comes in the early stages of (acisition) of knowledge, detachment, meditation and absorption, since they involve great struggle; but amrtopamam, comparable to nectar; pariname, in the end, when it arises from the maturity of knowledge, detachment, etc.; and which atma-buddhi-prasadajam, arises from the purity (prasada), trasparence like water, of one's intellect (atma-buddhi); tat, that; sukham, joy; is proktam, spoken of, by the learned ones ;as sattvikam, born of sattva. Or, the phrase atma-buddhi-prasadajam may mean 'arising from the high degree of clearness of that atma-buddhi (knowledge of or connected with the Self)'; therefore it is born of sattva.
18.38 That happiness which arises from the contact of the sense-organs with the objects, which is at first like nectar, and in the end like poison  that is declared to be Rajasic.
18.38 That which as first is like nectar, because the senses revel in their objects, but in the end acts like poison - that pleasure arises from Passion.
18.38. [The happiness]  which is like nectar at its time due to the contact between the senses and sense-objects; but which is like poison at the time of its result-that is considered to be of the Rajas (Strand).
18.38 That pleasure which arises from the contact of senses with their objects, which is like elixir at first but like poison in the end, is said to be Rajasika.
18.38 That joy is referred to as born of rajas which, arising from the contact of the organs and (their) objects, is like nectar in the beginning, but like poison at the end.
18.38 That which at the 'beginning,' i.e., at the time of experience looks like elixir because of the contact of senses with their objects agreable to them, but 'at the end,' i.e., when satiation or further incapacity to enjoy due to over-indulgence in them occurs, looks life poison - that pleasure is said to be Rajasika. In this latter state these so-called enjoyments cause the misery of Naraka.
18.38 See Comment under 18.39
18.38 Tat, that; sukham, joy; is smrtam, referred to; as rajasam, born of rajas; yat, which; visaya-indriya-samyogat, arising from the contact of the organs and (their) objects; is amrtopamam, like nectar; agre, in the beginning, in the intial moments; but iva, like; visam, poison; pariname, at the end-at the end of full enjoyment of the objects (of the senses), because it causes loss of strength, vigour, beauty, wisdom, [Prajna, the capacity to understand whatever is heard.] retentive faculty, wealth and diligence, and because it is the cause of vice and its conseent hell etc.
18.39 That happiness which at first as well as in the seel deludes the self, and which arises from sleep, indolence and heedlessness  that is declared to be Tamasic.
18.39 While the pleasure which from first to last merely drugs the senses, which springs from indolence, lethargy and folly - that pleasure flows from Ignorance.
18.39. The happiness which, [both] at the beginning and subseently, is of the nature of  deluding the Self; and which results from  sleep, indolence and heedleness-that is stated to be of the Tamas (Strand).
18.39 That pleasure which, at the beginning and at the end, deludes the self, through sleep, sloth and error - is declared to be Tamasika.
18.39 That joy is said to be born of tams which, both in the beginning and in the seel, is delusive to oneself and arises from sleep, laziness and inadvertence.
18.39 Pleasure of the Tamasika type causes delusion to the self at the beginning and the end of enjoyment. Here 'delusion' means the absence of knowledge about things as they are. Pleasure springing from sleep, sloth and error are the cause of it. Even at the time of experience, sleep etc., are the cause of delusion. It is clear how sleep causes delusion. 'Sloth' is indolence in sensory operations. When sensory activities are slow, dimness of knowledge results. 'Error' is heedlessness regarding what ought to be done. From this also occurs the dimness of knowledge. Thus, these two also cause delusion. Such pleasure is declared to be Tamasika. Therefore what is meant is this:  subduing Rajas and Tamas, the Sattva alone should be allowed to develop by the aspirant for relase.
18.36-39 Sukham etc. upto udahrtam.  At its time :  at the time of its practice  (use).  Like poison  (1st) :  Because  it is extremely difficult to give up the attachment for sense-objects cultivated during hundreds of [previous] life-periods. That has been said in the revealed literature as :
 
'[The path of sprituality] is the edge of a razor, painful and difficult to cross over etc.'
 
The serenity of intellect  (or mind) results from serenity in the Self, as there exists nothing else to be aspired for.  The  [Rajasic] happiness springs from the mutual contact between the sense-objects and senses, just as in the case of the eye due to its contact with colur.  That happiness which is due to sleep, indolence and heedlessness,  explained earlier, is of the Tamas (Strand).
18.39 That joy is udahrtam, said to be; tamasam, born of tamas; yat, which; both agre, in the beginning; ca, and; anubandhe, in the seel, after the end (of enjoyment); is mohanam, delusive; atmanah, to oneself; and nidra-alasya-pramada-uttham, arises from sleep, laziness and inadvertence.
Therefore, now is begun a verse in order to conclude this section [The section showing that all things in the whole of creation are under the influence of the three gunas.].
18.4 Hear from Me the conclusion or the final truth about this abandonment, O best of the Bharatas; abandonment, verily, O best of men, has been declared to be of three kinds.
18.4 O best of Indians! Listen to my judgment as regards this problem. It has a threefold aspect.
18.4. O best of Bharata's  descendants !  Listen to My considered view about relinishing :  Indeed the act of relinishing is rightly spoken to be three-fold, O best among men !
18.4 Listen to My decision, O Arjuna, about abandonment; for abandonment (Tyaga) is declared to be of three kinds.
18.4 O the most excellent among the descendants of Bharata, hear from Me the firm conclusion regarding that tyaga. For, O greatest among men, tyaga has been clearly declared to be of three kinds.
18.4 Regarding contradictory versions on Tyaga among disputants, listen from Me My decision. Tyaga has been described by Me in respect of actions prescribed by the scriptures from three points of view:  (1) as referring to fruits, (2) as referring to acts themselves and, (3) as referring to agency. It is contained in the statement, 'Surrendering all your actions to Me with a mind focussed on the self,' and 'Free from desire and selfishness and cured of fever - fight' (3.30). The renunciation of fruits consists in the following manner. 'Heaven and such other results arising from acts do not belong to Me.' Renunciation of acts is complete abandonment of the sense of possession in regard to one's acts. This sense of possession is of the following nature:  'Those acts are mine on account of their being the means for fruits which are to be mine.' Renunciation referring to agency is the renunciation of agency of oneself by ascribing the agency to the Lord of all.
18.4 See Comment under 18.11
18.4 Bharata-sattama, O the most excellent among the descendants of Bharata; srnu, hear, understand; me, from Me, from My statement; niscayam, the firm conclusion; tatra tyage, regarding that tyaga, regarding these alternative veiws on tyaga and sannyasa as they have been shown. Hi, for; purusavyaghra, O greatest among men; tyagah, tyaga; samprakirtitah, has been clearly declared, has been distinctly spoken of in the scriptures; to be trividhah, of three kinds, threefold, under the classes of tamasa (those based on tamas [Tamas: darkness, mental darkness, ignorance; one of the three alities of everything in Nature. Also see 14.8, and note under 2.45.-Tr.], etc. The Lord has used the word tyaga with the idea that the (primary) meanings of tyaga and sannyasa are verily the same.
Since it is difficult to comprehend this idea, that the primary meanings of the words tyaga and sannyasa can be threefold under the classification based on tamas etc. in the case of one who is unenlightened and who is alified for rites and duties-but not in the case of one who has realized the supreme Goal-,therefore no one else is capable of speaking the truth in this connection. Hence, listen to the firm conclusion of the Lord with regard to the supreme Truth as revealved by the scriptures.
Which, again, is this firm conclusion? In reply the Lord says:
18.40 There is no being on earth or again in heaven among the gods, that is liberated from the three alities born of Nature.
18.40 There is nothing anywhere on earth or in the higher worlds which is free from the three Qualities - for they are born of Nature.
18.40. Whether on the earth, or again among the gods in the heaven, there exists not a single being, which is free from these three Strands, born of the Material-Nature.
18.40 There is no creature, either on earth or again among the gods in heaven, that is free from these three Gunas born of Prakrti.
18.40 There is no such entity in the world or, again, among the gods in heaven, which can be free from these three gunas born of Nature.
18.40 There is no Sattva or creature born either among men etc., on the earth or among the gods in heaven, from Brahma down to immobile things, and having their basis in Prakrti, that is free from the dominance of the three Gunas of Prakrti.

'Tyaga', which has been determined as forming the means for release in the Sruti texts like 'By Tyaga alone do they attain immortality' (Ma. Na., 8.14), is of the same meaning as of the word 'Sannyasa'. It is rooted in the relinishment of the sense of agency in actions that are being performed.

The relinishment of the results and of possessiveness in actions, and the relinguishing of agency are to be gained by ascribing the agency to the Supreme Person. As all these are the effects of the increase of Sattva-guna, the differences of the effects of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas have been described at length with a view to instruct that Sattva is to be cultivated.

Now Sri Krsna, with a view to inculcate that actions done including their fruits, as a means to release and attainment of Him, must be of the nature of the worship of the Supreme Person, and that the fruit thereof is the attainment of Him - describes the actions obligatory for the alified classes of the people such as Brahmanas, differentiated by virtue of the natural alities arising from the Gunas such as Sattva, as also the occupations prescribed for those classes.
18.40 Na tad asti etc.  In this manner, the agent, the object and the instrument, the intellect and content, and happiness are classified under different heads of the Sattva etc.  Because they have a mutual relationship of  subordinate-and-principal or of the oppressed-and-opressor or of the togetherness; becuase they have modifications occuring either together or in a  specific seence; and because they, on that account, have varieties beyond all counting; they are capable of bringing forth fruits  (results) of umpteen variety. This (statement)  logically demonstrates in detail the uncomprehensibility of actions (their results)  which has been indicated earlier  (above IV, 17ff.).  All these beings, starting from the gods down to the immovables, do not transcend the relation with the traid of the Strands.  Indeed it has been said -
 
'Commencing from Brahma (personal god) down to the  [insignificant] worm, no one is really happy; all, without exception, having desire to live, undertake different  acts of agitation  (or commit different frauds to appear to be happy).'
 
Indeed the real happiness is [only] to him whose mind has gone beyond the Strands and not to anyone else.  This is what is intended here.		
 So far, the three-fold nature of each of the six items and also of the content etc., has been explained.  'Among them, he who is occupied with the group of the Sattva (Strand) and who has attained the divine wealth is fit for the subject under study;  and you are of that sort' - telling in this manner, Arjuna has been encouraged.
 
Now the following is declared :  If you engage yourself in the action with this reslove for correct knowledge, then because of  your undertaking of your own righteous action and because of your sanctity through wisdom, there is no bondage of aciton for you.  On the other hand, if you don't follow this,  [even] then there must necessarily be some activity in you; because  your birth itself stands to that effect.  Since, being controlled by its own intrinsic nature, everything, though it may have, for a short while, its nature concealed due to some fault, regains its own nature that becomes perceivable when the concealing agent disappears.  For example, the nature of the castes is of this nature.  Thus when an effort necessarily takes place, there would be [for its agent] its fruit.  This [the Bhagavat] says-
18.40 Na asti, there is no; tat, such; sattvam, entity, living creatures like men and others, or non-living things; prthivyam, in the world; va punah, or, again; an entity devesu, among the gods; divi, in heaven; yat, which; syat, can be [-this is connected with the preceding portion 'na tat, there is no such (entity)'-]; muktam, free; hih, from these; trubhih, three; gunaih, gunas, sattva etc.; prakrti-jaih, born of Nature.
It has been said that the entire transmigratory state together with its roots, characterized by action, agent and resuls-consisting of the gunas, sattva, rajas and tamas-, and projected by ignorance, is an evil. And this also has been said through the imagery of the Tree in the verse, '৷৷.which has its roots upward' etc. (15.1). It has been further said that, 'after felling that (Tree), with the strong sword of detachment, thereafter, that State has to be sought for' (15.3-4). And, as to that, since all things consist of the three gunas, there arises the impossibility of the eradication of the cause of worldly existence. Hence, it has to be shown how it can be eradicated. Besides, the purport of the scripture Gita has to be summed up, and it has also to be shown that the import of all the Vedas and the Smrtis, which must be put into practice by those who long for the Goal of human life, is verily this much. Hence begin the verses, 'The duties of the Brahmanas, the Ksatriyas and the Vaisyas৷৷.', etc.
18.41 Of Brahmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaisyas, as also of Sudras, O Arjuna, the duties are distributed according to the alities born of their own nature.
18.41 O Arjuna! The duties of spiritual teachers, the soldiers, the traders and the servants have all been fixed according to the dominant Quality in their nature.
18.41. The duties of the Brahmanas, the Ksatriyas, the Vaisyas, and of the Sudras are properly classified according to the Strands which are the sources of their nature, O scorcher of foes !
18.41  The duties of the Brahmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas and the Sudras are clearly divided, O Arjuna, according to Gunas, born of their nature.
18.41 O scorcher of enemies, the duties of the Brahmanas, the Ksatriyas and the Vaisyas, as also of the Sudras have been fully classified according to the gunas born from Nature.
18.41 The nature of Brahmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras are due to their respective inherent dispositions. The meaning is that their past Karma has been the cause of determining births as Brahmanas etc. The Sattva and other Gunas are the result of such Karma. The Sattva-guna is born from the inherent nature of the Brahmana becoming dominant by suppressing the alities of Rajas and Tamas. The ality of Rajas originates from the inherent nature of the Ksatriyas becoming dominant by suppressing alities of Sattva and Tamas. Tamoguna arises from the inherent nature of the Vaisya, becoming dominant in a little way by suppressing Sattva and Rajas. The duties and works assigned to them according to the Gunas constituting their inherent nature, are expounded and allotted by the Sastras in the order described. For the Sastras analyse that the Brahmanas etc., possess such and such attributes and such and such are their duties and occupations.
18.41 See Comment under 18.60
18.41 Parantapa, O scorcher of enemies; karmani, the duties; brahmana-ksatriya-visam, of the Brahmanas, the Ksatriyas and the Vaisyas; ca, as also; sudranam, of the Surdras-the Sudras have not been included with the others (in the compund word) because, owing to their having a single birth, [Sudras have no right to be invested with the sacred thread which, in the case of the other three castes, symbolizes a second birth.] they have no right to (the study of) the Vedas; pravibhaktani, have been fully classified, have been prescribed by making distinctions among them;-according to what?-gunahi, according to the gunas; svabhava-prabhavaih, born from Nature.
Nature means the Praktrti of God, His Maya consisting of the three gunas. 'Born from Nature' means 'born of these three gunas. In accordnace with these the duties such as control of the internal organs, etc. of the Brahmanas and others have been classified. Or (the meaning is): The source of the nature of the Brahmanas is the ality of sattva. Similarly, the source of the nature of the Ksatriyas is rajas, with sattva as a subordinate (ality); the source of the nature of the Vaisyas is rajas, with tamas as the subordinate (ality); the source of the nature of the Sudras is tamas, with rajas as the subordinate (ality); for the natures of the four are seen to be tranillity. lordliness, industriousness and dullness respectively. Or, svabhava (nature) means the (individual) tendencies of creatures earned in their past lives, which have become manifest in the present life for yielding their own results. The gunas which have that svabhava as their source (prabhava) are svabhava-prabhavah gunah.
Since the manifestation of the gunas cannot logically be uncaused, therefore a specific cause [i.e. the tendencies are the efficient cause, and Nature is the material cause.] has been posited by saying that Nature is the cause.
Thus, the duties such as control of the internal organs etc. have been classified in keeping with the effects of the gunas, sattva, rajas and tamas, which are born of Nature, born of Prakrti.
Objection: Well, are not the duties like controlling the internal organs etc. of the Brahmanas and others classified and enjoined by the scriptures? Why is it said that they are classified according to the gunas sattva etc.?
Reply: This objection is not valid. For, the duties like controlling the internal organs etc. of the Brahmanas and others have been classified even by the scriptures verily in keeping with the specific alities sattva etc.; certainly, not without reference to the gunas. Hence, though the duties have been divided by the scriputres, they are said to have been classified according to the gunas.
Which, again, are those duties? They are being spoken of:
18.42 Serenity, self-restraint, austerity, purity, forgiveness and also uprightness, knowledge, realisation and belief in God are the duties of the Brahmanas, born of (their own) nature.
18.42 Serenity, self-restraint, austerity, purity, forgiveness, as well as uprightness, knowledge, wisdom and faith in God - these constitute the duty of a spiritual Teacher.
18.42. Quietude, self-control, as well as purity, for-bearance, and also straightforwardness, knowledge, wisdom, and faith in another world are the duties of the Brahmanas, born of their nature.
18.42 Control of the senses and the mind, austerity, purity, forbearance, uprightness, knowledge, special knowledge, and faith - all these constitute the duty of Brahmana born of his inherent nature.
18.42 The natural duties of the Brahmanas are the control of the internal and external organs, austerity, purity, forgiveness, straightforwardness, knowledge as also wisdom [Knowledge refers to the understanding of subjects presented by the scriptures; wisdom means making them matters of one's own experience.] and faith.
18.42 'Sama' is the control of the external sense-organs. 'Dama' is the control of the mind. 'Tapas' is the chastisement of the body by controlling enjoyments, as enjoined by the Sastras. 'Sauca' is fitness for performing acts as enjoined by the Sastras. 'Ksanti' is preserving the composure of the mind, though injured by others. 'Arjava' is straightforwardness expressing itself in correct outward manifestation to others in consonance with one's own mind. 'Jnana' is knowledge about the real nature of the higher and lower truths. 'Vijnana' is the knowledge pertaining to exceptional attributes belonging to the Supreme Reality. 'Astikya' or faith is firm conviction in the truth of all things enjoined in the Vedas. The meaning is that it is unshakable by any reason whatever.

'Astikya' is positive conviction in the truth to the following effect:  (1) The Lord Vasudeva, the Supreme Person, is signified by the term, Supreme Brahman. (2) He is devoid of even the slightest trace or evil. (3) He possesses countless hosts of auspicious and excellent attributes such as knowledge, strength etc., boundless and natural. (4) To reveal His nature is the sole purpose of the whole of Vedas and the Vedanta and He can be known only through them. (5) He is the sole cause of the universe (6) He is the foundation of the entire universe. (7) He is the actuator of all. (8) All actions taught in the Vedas form His worship. (9) When worshipped through them, He confers fruits known as Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksa.

That such is the meaning has been declared in the following text:  'Indeed I am to be known from all the Vedas' (15.15); 'I am the origin of all; from Me proced everything' (10.8), 'All this is strung on Me' (7.7), 'Knowing me as the enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities ৷৷. he attains peace' (10.29), There is nothing greater than myself, Arjuna (7.7) 'He from whom proceeds the activity of all beings and by whom all this is pervaded - by worshipping Him with his duty, will a man reach perfection' (18.46); and 'He who knows Me as unborn, without a beginning and the great Lord of the worlds ৷৷.' (10.3)

Such are the duties of the Brahmana arising from his inherent nature.
18.42 See Comment under 18.60
18.42 Svabhavajam brahma-karma, the natural duties of the Brhamanas, of the Brahmana caste; are samah, control of the internal organs; damah, control of the external organs-these bear the meanings as explained earlier (see 6.3, 10.4, 16.1); tapah, austerity-bodily austerity, as explained before (17.14); saucam, purity, as already explained (in 13.7, 16.3); ksantih, forgiveness; arjavam, straightforwardness, simplicity; jnanam, knowledge; eva ca, as also vijnanam, wisdom; astikyam, faith, the idea of truth [Truth of the scritpures, existence of God, etc. In place of asti-bhavah Ast reads astika-bhavah, the feeling of conviction with regard to the existence of God and the other world. Tr.] respect for the teaching of the scriptures. By svabhavajam (natural) is conveyed the very same idea as was expressed in 'classified according to the gunas born from Nature' (41).
18.43 Prowess, splendour, firmness, dexterity and also not fleeing from battle, generosity and lordliness are the duties of the Kshatriyas, born of (their own) nature.
18.43 Valour, glory, firmness, skill, generosity, steadiness in battle and ability to rule - these constitute the duty of a soldier. They flow from his own nature.
18.43. Heroic deed, fiery energy, firmness, dexterity, and also non-feeling form battle, giving gifts, overlordship, are the duties of the Ksatriyas, born of their nature.
18.43 Valour, invincibility, steadiness, adroitness and non-fleeing in battle, generosity and lordliness are the duties of a Ksatriya born of his inherent nature.
18.43 The natural duties of the Ksatriyas are heroism, boldness, fortitude, capability, and also not retreating from battle, generosity and lordliness.
18.43 'Valour' is the ability of plunging into a battle without fear. 'Invincibility' is the capacity to remain undefeated by others. 'Steadiness' is the capacity to complete a work that has been started despite obstacles. 'Adroitness' is the ability in executing all works. 'Apalayana' is not fleeing in a battle though one is convinced of one's death. 'Generosity' is parting with one's own possessions to others even to its entirety. 'Lordliness' is the capacity to govern all others. This is the duty of a Ksatriya born of his inherent nature.
18.43 See Comment under 18.60
18.43 Svabhavajam, the natural; ksatra-karma, [A variant reading is ksatram karma.-Tr.] enjoined duties of the Ksatriyas, of the Ksatriya caste; are sauryam, heroism; tejah, boldness; dhrtih, fortitude, as is seen in the case of one who is not depressed under all circumstances, being sustained by doggedness; daksyam, capability engagement without confusion in duties which suddenly present them-selves; api ca, and also; apalayanam, not retreating; yuddhe, from battle, not fleeing from enemies; danam, generosity, being free in the distribution of gifts; isvarabhavah, lordliness, manifesting (exercising) rulership over those who have to be ruled.
18.44 Agriculture, cattle-rearing and trade are the duties of the Vaisya (merchant), born of (their own) nature; and action consisting of service is the duty of the Sudra (servant-class), born of (their own) nature.
18.44 Agriculture, protection of the cow and trade are the duty of a trader, again in accordance with his nature. The duty of a servant is to serve, and that too agrees with his nature.
18.44. Ploughing, cattle-tending and trading are the actions of the Vaisyas, born of  their nature.  The action, in the form of service, is of  the Sudras, born of their nature.
18.44 Agriculture, cattle-breeding and trade are the duties of the Vaisya born of his nature৷৷. And the duty of a Sudra is one of service, born of his nature.
18.44 The natural duties of the Vaisyas are agriculture, cattle-rearing and trade. Of the Sudras, too, the natural duty is in the form of service.
18.44 'Agriculture' is cultivation to produce crops. The meaning of 'cattle breeding' is the protection and rearing of cattle. 'Trade' is the activity causing the amassing of wealth through buying and selling. This is the duty of Vaisya born of his inherent nature.

The duty of a Sudra, born of his inherent nature, is service to the three Orders mentioned earlier.

All these have been described to stress that the occupational activities of the four stations are auxiliary to the performance of sacrifices etc., which are ordained by the Sastra. Sacrifices etc., are common to the first three stations. Control of the senses etc., are common to those who, among the first three stations, are anxious for release. As a Brahmana possesses preponderance of Sattva, and as the control of the senses, mind etc., can be performed by him easily and naturally, control of the senses etc., have been prescribed as his duty. As control of the mind, senses etc., can be performed only with difficulty by the Ksatriyas and the Vaisyas owing to the preponderance of Rajas and Tamas respectively in them, these have not been stated as their duty. The occupation of a Brahmana is officiating as priest in sacrifices, teaching the Vedas and receiving gifts. The occupation of a Ksatriya is protecting the people and that of the Vaisyas is farming etc., as mentioned before. The duty and occupation of the Sudra is service to the three stations.
18.44 See Comment under 18.60
18.44 Svabyavajam, the natural; vaisya-karma, duties of the Vaisyas, of the Vaisya caste; are krsi-gauraksyavanijyam, agriculture, cattle rearing and trade: Krsi is tilling of land. Orre who rears cattle (go) is goraksa; the abstract form of that word is gauraksyam, animal-husbandry. Vanijyam means the occupation of a trader, consisting of buying and selling.
Sudrasya, of the Sudra; api, too; svabhavajam, the natural; karma, duty; is paricaryatmakam, in the form of service.
When rightly pursued, the natural result of these duties enjoined for the castes is the attainment of heaven-which act is evident from such Smrti texts as, 'People belonging to the castes and stages of life, who are true to their own duties, experience after death the fruit of their actions. And after that, as a result of the remnants of their merits they are born in some excellent region, caste and family, with greater piety, longevity, learning, conduct, wealth, happiness and intelligence' (Ap. Dh. Su. 2.2.2.3), etc. And in the Puranas also it is particularly mentioned that poeple belonging to the (different) castes and stages of life come to have specific results in the form of different worlds.
But this result that is going to be stated follows from a different cause:
5.10 He who does actions, offering them to Brahman, and abandoning attachment, is not tainted by sin, just as a lotus-leaf is not tainted by water.
5.10 He who dedicates his actions to the Spirit, without any personal attachment to them, he is no more tainted by sin than the water lily is wetted by water.
5.10. Who performs actions by offering them to the Brahman and giving up attachment-he is not stained by sin just as the lotus-leaf is  [not stained]  by water.
5.10 He who acts without attachment, reposing all actions on Brahman (Prakrti), is untouched by evil, as a lotus-leaf by water.
5.10 One who acts by dedicating actions to Brahman and by renouncing attachment, he does not become polluted by sin, just as a lotus leaf is not by water.
5.10 Here the term, Brahman denotes Prakrti. Later on Sri Krsna will say:  'The great Brahman is My womb' (14.3). Since Prakrti abides in the form of senses which are particular off-shoots of Prakrti, he who, as said in the passage beginning with 'Even though he is seeing, hearing ৷৷.' (5.8), understands that all actions proceed from Brahman (Prakrti); renounces all attachment while engaging himself in all actions, reflecting, 'I am doing nothing.' Such a person, though existing in contact with Prakrti, is not contaminated by sin which is the result of the wrong identification of the Atman with Prakrti and is the cause of bondage. Just as a lotus leaf is not wetted by water, actions do not affect or defile a person with sin, if he is free from such identification with the body.
5.10 See Comment under 5.11
5.10 On the other hand, again, one who is ignorant of the Truth and is engaged in Karma-yoga, yah, who; karoti, acts; adhaya, by dedicating, by surrendering; all karmani, actions; brahmani, to Brahman, to God; with the idea, 'I am working for Him, as a servant does everything for his master', and tyaktva, by renouncing; sangam, attachment, even with regard to teh resulting Liberation; sah, he; na lipyate, does not get polluted, is not affected; papena, by sin; iva, just as; padma-patram, a lotus leaf; is not ambhasa, by water.
The only result that will certainly accrue from such action will be the purification of the heart.
18.46 He from Whom all the beings have evolved and by Whom all this is pervaded  worshipping Him with his own duty, man attains perfection.
18.46 Man reaches perfection by dedicating his actions to God, Who is the source of all being, and fills everything.
18.46. That, whence the activities of the beings arise; by which this universe is pervaded-worshipping That by one's own prescribed action, a man attains success.
18.46 He from whome arise the activity of all beings and by whom all this is pervaded - by worshipping Him with his own duty man reaches perfection.
18.46 A human being achieves success by adoring through his own duties Him from whom is the origin of creatures, and by whom is all this pervaded.
18.46 He from whom arise all activities as origination of all beings and by whom all this is pervaded, by worshipping Him, i.e., Myself, who abide in Indra and other divinites as the Inner Ruler, man attains perfection, consisting in the attainment of Myself by My grace. It has been told before that everything originates from Me and all this is pervaded by Me, in texts like the following:  'I am the origin and dissolution of the whole universe' (7.6), 'There is nothing higher than Myself, O Arjuna' (7.7), 'This entire universe is pervaded by Me in an unmanifest form' (9.4), 'Under My supervision, the Prakrti gives birth to all mobile and immobile entities' (9.10) and 'I am the origin of all; from Me proceed everything' (10.8).

18.46 Manavah, a human being; vindati, achieves; siddhim, success, merely in the form of the ability for steadfastness in Knowledge; abhyarcya, by adoring, worshipping; svakarmana, with his own duties stated above, as allotted to each caste; tam, Him, God; yatah, from whom, from which God; comes pravrttih, origin,-or, from which internal Ruler comes the activities; ;bhutanam, of creatures, of living beings; and yena, by whom, by which God; is tatam, pervaded; sarvam, all; idam, this world.
Since this is so, therefore,
18.47 Better is one's own duty (though) destitute of merits, than the duty of another well performed. He who does the duty ordained by his own nature incurs no sin.
18.47 It is better to do one's own duty, however defective it may be, than to follow the duty of another, however well one may perform it. He who does his duty as his own nature reveals it, never sins.
18.47. Better is one's own prescribed duties, [born of  one's nature, even though] it is devoid of ality, than another's duty well executed; the doer of duty, dependent on (or prescribed according to)  one's own nature, does not incur sin.
18.47 Better is one's own duty, though ill done, than the duty of another, though well-performed৷৷৷৷৷৷ When one does the duty ordained by his own nature, he incurs no stain.
18.47 One's own duty, (though) defective, is superior to another's duty well performed. By performing a duty as dictated by one's own nature, one does not incur sin.
18.47 One's proper Dharma is that which is suitable for performance by oneself, in the form of worshipping Myself, relinishing agency etc., as has been taught. For, Karma Yoga, consisting in the activities of sense organs, is easy to perform by one in association with Prakrti. Thus, Karma Yoga, even if it is defective in some respects, is better than the Dharma of another, i.e., than Jnana-yoga, even for a person capable of controlling his senses, which is an attainment liable to negligence, because it consists of control over all sense-organs; for, though this may be well performed occasionaly, one is always liable to deflection from it.

He explains the same:

As Karma consists of the activities of the sense-organs, it is ordained by Nature for one who is conjoined with Prakrti, i.e., the body. So by performing Karma Yoga one does not incur any stain. But Jnana Yoga is liable to negligence, because it reires the control of the senses from the very beginning for its performance. One intent on it is likely to incur stain from negligence. [Thus we are reminded about what was mentioned in the third chapter - that Karma Yoga alone is greater.]

18.47 Svadharmah, one's own duty; though vigunah, defective-the word though has to be supplied-; is sreyan, superior to, more praiseworthy than; paradharmat, another's duty; su-anusthitat, well performed. Kurvan, by performing; karma, a duty; svabhavaniyatam, as dictated by one's own nature-this phrase means the same as svabhavajam (born from Nature) which has been stated earlier-; na apnoti, one does not incur; kilbisam, sin. As poison is not harmful to a worm born it it, so one does not incur sin by performing a duty dictated by one's own nature.
It has been siad that, as in the case of a worm born in poison, a person does not incur sin while performing his duties which have been dictated by his own nature; and that someone else's duty is fraught with fear; also that, one who does not have the knoweldge of the Self, (he) surely cannot remain even for a moment without doing work (cf. 3.5). Hence-
18.48 One should not abandon, O Arjuna, the duty to which one is born, though faulty; for, all undertakings are enveloped by evil, as fire by smoke.
18.48 The duty that of itself falls to one's lot should not be abandoned, though it may have its defects. All acts are marred by defects, as fire is obscured by smoke.
18.48. O son of  Kunti !  One should not give up the nature-born duty, even if it is (appears to be) defective.  For, all beginnings are enveloped by harm just as the fire by smoke.
18.48 One should not relinish one's works, O Arjuna, though it may be imperfect; for, all enterprises are enveloped by imperfections as fire by smoke.
18.48 O son of Kunti, one should not give up the duty to which one is born, even though it be faulty. For all undertakings are surrounded with evil, as fire is with smoke.
18.48 So, one should not relinish one's works, understanding that they are natural, are easy to perform and not liable to negligence. Such thoughts coupled with the idea that there are imperfections in them should not lead you to abandon them. The meaning is that though one is fit for Jnana Yoga, one should perform Karma Yoga only. All enterprises, be they of Karma or Jnana, are indeed enveloped by imperfections, by pain, as fire by smoke. But still there is this difference:  Karma Yoga is easy and does not involve negligence, but Jnana Yoga is contrary to this.
18.48 See Comment under 18.60
18.48 Kaunteya, O son of Kunti; na tyajet, one should not give up;-what?-the karma, duty; sahajam, to which one is born, which devolves from the very birth; api, even though; it be sadosam, faulty, consisting as it is of the three gunas. Hi, for; sarva-arambhah, all undertakings (-whatever are begun are arambhah, i.e. 'all actions', according to the context-), being constituted by the three gunas (-here, the fact of being constituted by the three gunas is the cause-); are avrtah, surrounded; dosena, with evil; iva, as;; agnih, fire; is dhumena, with smoke, which comes into being concurrently.
One does not get freed from evil by giving up the duty to which one is born-called one's own duty-, even though (he may be) fulfilling somody else's duty. Another's duty, too, is fraught with fear. The meaning is: Since action cannot be totally given up by an unelightened person, therefore he should not relinish it.
Opponent: Well, is it that one should not abandon action because it cannot be given up completely, or is it because evil [Evil resulting from discarding daily obligatory duties.] follows from the giving up of the duty to which one is born?
Counter-objection: What follows from this?
Opponent: If it be that the duty to which one is born should not be renounced because it is impossible to relinish it totally, then the conclusion that can be arrived at is that complete renunciation (of duty) is surely meritorious!
Counter-objection: Truly so. But, may it not be that total relinishment is itself an impossibility? Is a person ever-changeful like the gunas of the Sankhyas, or is it that action itself is the agent, as it is in the case of the momentary five [Rupa (from), vedana (feeling), vijnana (momentary consciousness), sanjna (notion), samskara (mental impressions)-these have only momentary existence. In their case there can be no distinction between action and agent, simply due to the fact of their being momentary.] forms of mundane consciousness propounded by the Buddhists? In either case there can be no complete renunciation of action.
Then there is also a third standpoint (as held by the Vaisesikas): When a thing acts it is active, and inactive when that very thing does not act. If this be the case here, it is possible to entirely give up actions. But the speciality of the third point of view is that a thing is not ever-changing, nor is action itself the agent. What then? A nonexistent action originates in an existing thing, and an existing action gets destroyed. The thing-in-itself continues to exist along with its power (to act), and that itself is the agent. This is what the followers of Kanada say. [Their view is that agentship consists in 'possessing the power to act', not in being the substratum of action.] What is wrong with this point of view.
Vedantin: The defect indeed lies in this that, this veiw is not in accord with the Lord's view.
Objection: How is this known?
Vedantin: Since the Lord as said, 'Of the unreal there is no being৷৷.,' etc. (2.16). The view of the followers of Kanada is, indeed, this that the non-existent becomes existent, and the existent becomes nonexistent.
Objection: What defect can there be if it be that this view, even though not the view of the Lord, yet conforms to reason?
Vedantin: The answer is: This is surely faulty since it contradicts all valid evidence.
Objection: How?
Vedantin: As to this, if things like a dvyanuka (dyad of two anus, atoms) be absolutely nonexistent before origination, and after origination continue for a little while, and again become absolutely non-existent, then, in that acase, the existent which was verily nonexistent comes into being, [Here Ast. adds, 'sadeva asattvam apadyate, that which is verily existent becomes nonexistent'.-Tr.] a non-entity becomes an entity, and an entity becomes a non-entity! If this be the view, then the non-enity that is to take birth is comparable to the horns of a hare before it is born, and it comes into being with the help of what are called material (inherent), non-mateial (non-inherent) and efficient causes. But it cannot be said that nonexistence has origination in this way, or that it depends on some cause, since this is not seen in the case of nonexistent things like horns of a hare, etc. If such things as pot etc. which are being produced be of the nature of (potentially) existing things, then it can be accepted that they originate by depending on some cause which merely manifests them. [According to Vedanta, before origination a thing, e.g. a pot, remains latent in its material cause, clay for instance, with its name and form unexpressed, and it depends on other causes for the manifestation of name and form.] Moreover, if the nonexistent becomes existent, and the existent becomes non-existent, then nobody will have any faith while dealing with any of the means of valid knowledge objects of such knowledge, because the conviction will be lacking that the existent is existent and the nonexistent is nonexistent!
Further, when they speak of origination, they (the Viasesikas) hold that such a thing as a dvyanuka (dyad) comes to have relationship with its own (material) causes (the two atoms) and existence, and that it is nonexistent before origination; but later on, depending on the operation of its own causes, it becomes connected with its own causes, viz the atoms, as also with existence, through the inherent (or inseparable) relationship called samavaya. After becoming connected, it becomes an existent thing by its inherent relationship with its causes. [The effect (dyad) has inherent relationship with existence after its material causes (the two atoms) come into association.]
It has to be stated in this regard as to how the nonexistent can have an existent as its cuase, or have relationship with anything. For nobody can establish through any valid means of knowledge that a son of a barren woman can have any existence or relationship or cause.
Vaisesika: Is it not that relationship of a non-existent thing is not at all established by the Vaisesikas? Indeed, what is said by them is that only existent entities like dvyanuka etc. have the relationship in the form of samavaya with their own causes.
Vedantin: No, for it is not admitted (by them) that anything has existence before the (samavaya) relationship (occurs). It is surely not held by the Vaisesikas that a pot etc. have any existence before the potter, (his) stick, wheel, etc. start functioning. Nor do they admit that clay itself takes the shape of a pot etc. As a result, it has to be admitted (by them) as the last aternative that nonexistence itself has some relationship!
Vaisesika: Well, it is not contradictory even for a nonexistent thing to have the relationship in the form of inherence.
Vedantin: No, because this is not seen in the case of a son of a barren woman etc. If the antecedent nonexistence (prag-abhava) of the pot etc. alone comes into a relationship with its own (material) cause, but not so the nonexistence of the son of a barren woman etc. though as nonexistence both are the same, then the distinction between the (two) nonexistences has to be explained. Through such descriptions ( of abhava, nonexistence) as nonexistence of one, nonexistence of two, nonexistence of all, antecedent nonexistence, nonexistence after destruction, mutual nonexistence and absolute non-existence, nobody can show any distinction (as regards nonexistence itself)! There being no distinction, (therefore, to say that:) 'it is only the "antecedent nonexistence" of the pot which takes the form of the pot through the (action of) the potter and others, and comes into a relationship with the existing pot-halves which are its own (material) causes and becomes fit for all empirical processes [Such as production, destruction, etc.] but the "nonexistence after destruction" of that very pot does not do so, though it, too, is nonexistence. Hence, the "nonexistence after destruction", etc. [Etc. stands for 'mutual nonexistence (anyonya-abhava)' and 'absolute nonexistence (atyanta-abhava)'.] are not fit for any empirical processes, whereas only the "antecedent nonexistence" of things called dvyanuka etc. is fit for such empirical processes as origination etc.'-all this is incongruous, since as nonexistence it is indistinguishable, as are 'absolute nonexistence' and 'nonexistence after destruction'.
Vaisesika: Well, it is not at all said by us that the 'antecedent nonexistence' becomes existent.
Vedantin: In that case, the existent itself becomes existent , as for instance, a pot's becoming a pot, or a cloth's becoming a cloth. This, too, like nonexistence becoming existent, goes against valid evidence.
Even the theory of transformation held by the Sankhyas does not differ from the standpoint of the Vaisesikas, since they believe in the origination of some new attribute [i.e. in the origination of a transformation that did not exist before.] and its destruction. Even if manifestation and disappearance of anything be accepted, yet there will be contradiction with valid means of knowledge as before in the explanation of existence or nonexistence of manifestation and disappearance. Hery is also refuted the idea that origination etc. (of an effect) are merely particular states of its cuase. As thelast alternative, it is only the one entity called Existence that is imagined variously through ignorance to be possessed of the states of origination, destruction, etc. like an actor (on a stage). This veiw of the Lord has been stated in the verse, 'Of the unreal there is no being৷৷.' (2.16). For, the idea of existence is constant, while the others are inconstant.
Objection: If the Self be immutable, then how does the 'renunciation of all actions' become illogical?
Vedantin: If the adjuncts (i.e. body and organs) be real or imagined through ignorance, in either case, action, which is their attribute, is surely superimposed on the Self through ignorance. From this point of view it has been said that an unenlightened person is incapable of totally renouncing actions even for a moment (cf. 3.5). The enlightened person, on the other hand, can indeed totally renounce actions when ignorance has been dispelled through Illumination; for it is illogical that there can (then) remain any trace of what has been superimposed through ignorance. Indeed, no trace remains of the two moons, etc. superimposed by the vision affected by (the disease called) Timira when the desease is cured.
This being so, the utterance, 'having given up all actions mentally' (5.13), etc. as also, 'Being devoted to his own duty' (45) and 'A human being achieves 'success by adoring Him through his own duties (46), becomes justifiable.
What was verily spoken of as the success arising from Karma (-yoga), characterized as the fitness for steadfastness in Knowledge,-the fruit of that (fitness), characterized as 'steadfastness in Knowledge' consisting in the perfection in the form of the state of one (i.e. a monk) free from duties, has to be stated. Hence the (following) verse is begun:
18.49 He whose intellect is unattached everywhere, who has subdued his self, from whom desire has fled,  he by renunciation, attains the supreme state of freedom from action.
18.49 He whose mind is entirely detached, who has conquered himself, whose desires have vanished, by his renunciation reaches that stage of perfect freedom where action completes itself and leaves no seed.
18.49. He, whose mind entertains no attachment to anything, who is self-conered and is free from craving-he attains by means of renunciation the supreme success of actionlessness.
18.49 He whose understanding is on all sides unattached, whose self is conered, who is free from desires - he attains by renunciation the supreme perfection transcending all activity.
18.49 He whose intellect remains unattached to everything, who has conered his internal organs and is desireless, attains through monasticism the supreme perfection consisting in the state of one free from duties.
18.49 He whose understanding is, on all sides, without attachments, concerning fruits etc., whose 'self is conered,' i.e., who has conered his mind; who, by contemplating on the agency of the Supreme Person, is free from the habit of attributing agency to the self; and who is thus eipped with Sannyasa which has been positively determined to be the same as Tyaga - such a man, performing actions, attains supreme perfection which is free from all activities. The meaning is that he attains devotion to Dhyana which is the consummation of even Jnana Yoga; he attains Dhyana Yoga (Yoga of meditation) consisting in the complete cessation of sensory activity, which is going to be described hereafter.
18.49 See Comment under 18.60
18.49 Asakta-buddhih, he whose intellect, the internal organ, remains unattached; sarvatra, to everything, with regard to son, wife and others who are the cuases of attachment; jitatma, who has conered his internal organs; and vigata-sprhah, who is desireless, whose thirst for his body, life and objects of enjoyment have been eradicated;-he who is such a knower of the Self, adhigaccahti, attains; sannyasena, through monasticism, through perfect knowledge or through renunciation of all actions preceded by this knowledge; the paramam, supreme, most excellent; naiskarmya-siddhim, perfection consisting in the state of one free from duties.
One is said to be free from duties from whom duties have daparted as a result of realizing that the actionless Brahman is his Self; his state is naiskarmyam. That siddhi (perfection) which is this naiskarmya is naiskarmya-siddhi. Or, this phrase means 'achievement of naiskarmya', i.e., achievement of the state of remaining established in one's own real nature as the actionless Self-which is different from the success arising from Karma (-yoga), and is of the form of being established in the state of immediate Liberation. Accordingly has it been said, '৷৷.having given up all actions mentally,৷৷.without doing or causing (others) to do anything at all' (5.13).
The stages through which one who has attained success-which has the aforesaid characteristics and which arises from the performance of one's own duties mentioned earlier as worship of God-, and in whom has arisen discriminative knowledge, achieves perfection-in the form of exclusive adherence to Knowledge of the Self and consisting in the state of one free from duties-have to be stated. With this is view the Lord says:
18.5 Acts of sacrifice, gift and austerity should not be abandoned, but should be performed; sacrifice, gift and also austerity are the purifiers of the wise.
18.5 Acts of sacrifice, benevolence and austerity should not be given up but should be performed, for they purify the aspiring soul.
18.5. The actions of  [Vedic]  sacrifice,  gift and austerity should not be relinished and they must necessarily be performed; for the men of wisdom the [Vedic sacrifice, gift and also austerity are the means of purification.
18.5 (a) The acts of sacrifice, gifts and austerities should not be relinished; but should be performed৷৷.

(b). ৷৷.For sacrifices, gifts and austerities are the means of purification for the wise.
18.5 The practice of sacrifice, charity and austerity is not to be abandoned; it is surely to be undertaken. Sacrifice, charity and austerity are verily the purifiers of the wise.
18.5 Acts such as sacrifices, gifts, austerities etc., enjoined in the Vedas should not be relinished by the aspirant for release, but should be performed day after day until his death.

Why?

Acts like sacrifices, gifts and austerities associated with the different stations of life, are the means of purification for the wise., i.e., for those given to contemplation. Contemplation is worship. For the aspirants who perform such worship (Upasana) throughout their lives, they (sacrifices etc.) are a help to erase the previous Karmas which stand in the way of the fulfilment of such worship.
18.5 See Comment under 18.11
18.5 Yajna-dana-tapah-karma, the practice of sacrifice, charity and austerity-this threefold practice; na tyajyam, is not to be abandoned; tat, it; is eva, surely; karyam, to be undertaken. Why? Yajnah, sacrifice; danam, charity; and tapah, austerity; are eva, verily; pavanani, the purifiers, the causes of sanctification; manisinam, of the wise, i.e. of those who do not seek results for themselves.
18.50 Learn from Me in brief, O Arjuna, how he who has attained perfection reaches Brahman (the Eternal), that supreme state of knowledge.
18.50 I will now state briefly how he, who has reached perfection, finds the Eternal Spirit, the state of Supreme Wisdom.
18.50. Having attained the success, how he attains the Brahman, an attainment which is confirmed to be the final beatitude of true knowledge-that you must learn from Me briefly.
18.50 Learn from me in brief, O Arjuna, how, one who has attained perfection, attains the brahman (or the self), who is the supreme consummation of knowledge.
18.50 Understand for certain from Me, in brief indeed, O son of Kunti, that process by which one who has achieved success attains Brahman, which is the supreme consummation of Knowledge.
18.50 One who has attained 'perfection', viz., one who has attained perfection in meditation generated by the Karma Yoga performed day after day till death - how, in what way, he attains the brahman, learn this from Me in brief. It is the same Brahman who is described as the supreme consummation of knowledge. The meaning is that the self is the supreme consummation, the supreme end, of knowledge which is of the nature of meditation.
18.50 See Comment under 18.60
18.50 Nibodha, understand for certain; me, from Me, from My utterance-. Is it elaborately? The Lord says, no, samasena, in brief; eva, indeed, O son of Kunti, how siddhim praptah, one who has achieved success, one who, by worshipping God through one's duties, has achieved success in the form of fitness of the body and organs for steadfastness in Knowledge, which comes from His grace; (-the reiteration of the phrase siddhim praptah is meant for introducing what follows; what is that succeeding subject for which this reiteration stands is being answered:) yatha tatha, that process by which, that process in the form of steadfastness in Knowledge, by which that process of aciring steadfastness in Knowledge by which; apnoti, attains; brahma, Brahman, th supreme Self-.
In order to point out-as 'It is this'-the realization of Brahman which was promised in, 'that process by which one৷৷.attains Brahman,' the Lord says; ya, which; is the para, supreme; nistha, consummation, i.e. the supreme culmination; jnanasya, of Knowledge. Of what? Of the knowledge of Brahman. Of what kind is it? It is of the same kind as the realization of the Self. Of what kind is that? As is the Self. Of what nature is It? As has been described by the Lord and the Upanisadic texts, and established through reason.
Objection: Is it not that knowledge takes the form of its object? But it is not admitted anywhere that the Self is an object, or even that It has form.
Pseudo-Vedantin: Is it not heard of in such texts as, 'radiant like the sun' (Sv. 3.8), 'Of the nature of effulgence' (Ch. 3.14.2) and 'Self-effulgent' (Br. 4.3.9), that the Self has form?
Objection: No, because those sentences are meant for refuting the idea that the Self is of the nature of darkness. When the Self is denied of possessing forms of substance, ality, etc., the contingency arises of the Self's being of the nature of darkness. The sentences, 'radiant like the sun,' etc. are meant for ruting this. And this follows from the specific denial of from by saying, 'Formless' (Ka. 1.3.15), and from such texts as, 'His form does not exist within the range of vision; nobody sees Him with the eye' (Ka. 2.3.9: Sv. 4.20), 'soundless, touchless' (ka. 1.3.15), etc. which show that the Self is not an object of perception. Therefore it remains unproved that there can be any knowledge which takes the form of the Self. How, then, can there be the knowledge of the Self? For, all knowledge that there can be with regard to objects assumes their respective forms. And it has been said that the Self has no form. Moreover, if both knowledge and the Self be formless, then how can there be the consummation [Firmness in Self-realization.] of the (repeated) contemplation on that (knowledge of the Self)?
Vedantin: No. Since it can be established that the Self is supremely taintless, pure and subtle, and it can also be established that the intellect can have taintlessness etc. like the Self, therefore it stands to reason that the intellect can take a form resembling the consciousness of the Self. The mind becomes impressed with the semblance of the intellect; the organs become impressed with the semblance of the mind; and the body becomes impressed with the semblance of hte organs. Hence it is that the idea of the body itself being the Self is held by ordinary people. The Lokayatikas (materialists), who hold that the body is identical with consciousness, say that a person is a body endowed with consciousness; so also there are others who say that the organs are identical with consciousness; there are others who say that the mind is identical with consciousness, and still others who say that the intellect is identical with consciousness. Some accept as the Self the Unmanifest [The inmost Ruler (antaryamin), possessing a semblance of Consciousness.], called the Undifferentiated, which is more internal than that (intellect) and is within the domain of (primordial) ignorance. Indeed, in every case, beginning from the intellect to the body, the cause of mis-conceived Selfhood is the semblance of the Consciousness that is the Self. Hence, knowledge about the Self is not a subject for injunction.
What then? Only the eradication of the superimposition of name, form, etc., which are not the Self, is what has to be undertaken, but not the knowledge of the Self that is Consciousness. For it is the Self which is experienced as possessed of the forms of all the various objects that are superimposed (on It) through ignorance. It is evidently because of this that the Buddhists who uphold the view of (momentary) consciousness have concluded that there is no substance at all apart from (momentary) consciousness, and that it is not in need of any other valid proof since they hold that it is self-cognized. Therefore, what is to be undertaken is only the elimination of the superimposition on Brahman through ignorance, but no effort is needed for knowing Brahman (Consciousness), for It is ite self-evident! It is because the intellect is distracted by particular appearances of name and form imagined through ignorance that Brahman, even though self-evident, easily realizable, nearer than all else and identical with oneself, appears to be concealed, difficult to realize, very far and different, But to those whose intellect has become free from external appearances and who have obtained the grace of a teacher and serenity of mind, there is nothing more blissful, manifest, well known, easily realized and nearer to oneself than this Self. And thus it has been declared, 'directly realizable, righteous,' etc. (9.2).
However, some wiseacres assert that the intellect cannot comprehend the entity called the Self since It is formless; hence, complete steadfastness in Knowledge is impossible. This is truly so for those who have not associated with a traditional line of teachers; who have not heard the Upanisads; whose intellects are too much engrossed with external objects; and who have not applied themselves diligently to the perfect means of knowledge. For those, on the other hand, who are the opposite of these, it is absolutely impossible to have the idea of reality with regard to empirical objects, which are within the realm of duality involving the knower and the known, because in their case there is no perception of any other thing apart from the Consciousness that is the Self. We have already said how this is certainly so and not otherwise. It has been stated by the Lord also, 'That during which creatures keep awake, it is night to the seeing sage' (2.69).
Therefore, the cessation of the perception of differences in the form of external things is alone the cause of resting in the reality of the Self. For, that which is called the Self is never an object which is not well known, attainable, rejectable or acceptable to anyone at any time. Were that Self to be indeed not self-evident, all activities would become meaningless. [According to Ast. the latter portion of this sentence is: svarthah sarvah pravrttayah vyarthah prasajyeran, all activities meant for one's own benefit would become meaningless.-Tr.]. For it cannot be imagined that they could be undertaken for unconscious objects like the body etc. Besides, it cannot be that pleasure is for pleasure's sake, or that sorrow is for sorrow's sake. Moreover, all empirical dealings are meant for culminating in the realization of the Self. [According to B.S. 3.4.26, 'On the strength of the Upanisadic sanction of sacrifices etc. all religious activities as well are necessary৷৷.', sacrifices etc. are meant for leading to the realization of the Self, without which they would become meaningless.] Therefore, just as for knowing one's own body there is no need of any other (external) means of knowledge so also there is no need of any other means of knowledge, for the realization of the Self which is innermost (in relation to the body etc.). Hence it is established that steadfastness in the knowledge of the Self is a fact very well known to the discriminating people.
Even to those who hold that knowledge is formless and not cognized by direct perception, cognition of an object is dependent on knowledge. Hence it has to be admitted that knowledge is as immediate as pleasure etc. And this follows also from the impossibility of a desire to know (knowledge). Had knowledge been not self-evident, it could have been sought for like any object of knowledge. And in that case, as [This is Ast.'s reading; others read tatha.-Tr.] a knower seeks to perceive through knowledge such objects of knowledge as pot etc., similarly the knower would have sought to perceive knowledge through another knowledge! But this is not the case. Therefore knowledge is ite self-revealing, and for the very same reason the knower also is self-revealed. Hence, effort is not needed for knowledge, but only for the removal of the notion of what is not-Self. [In place of anatma-buddhi-nivrttau, Ast. has 'anatmani atma-buddhi-nivrttau, for the termination of thinking what is not the Self as the Self'.-Tr.] Conseently, steadfastness in Knowledge is easy of accomplishment.
It is being stated how this supreme consummation of Knowledge is to be attained:
18.51 Endowed with a pure intellect, controlling the self by firmness, relinishing sound and other objects and abandoning attraction and hatred.
18.51 Guided always by pure reason, bravely restraining himself, renouncing the objects of sense and giving up attachment and hatred;
18.51. He, who has got a totally pure intellect by fully controlling his self (mind) with firmness, and renouncing sense-objects, sound etc., and driving out desire and hatred;
18.51 Endowed by a purified understanding, subduing the mind by steadiness, relinishing sound and other objectts of the senses and casting aside love and hate;
18.51 Being endowed with a pure intellect, and controlling oneself with fortitude, rejecting the objects-beginning from sound [Sound, touch, form and colour, taste and smell.-Tr.], and eliminating attachment and hatred;
18.51 - 18.53 'Endowed with a purified understanding' means endowed with the Buddhi capable of understanding the self as it is in reality; 'subduing the mind by steadiness' means making the mind fit for meditation by turning away from external and internal objects; 'relinishing sound and other objects of senses' means keeping them far away, casting aside love and hate occasioned by them (i.e., the sense objects).

'Resorting to solitude' means living in a lonely place free from hindrances to meditation; 'eat but little' means eating neither too much nor too little; 'restraining speech, body and mind' means directing the operations of body, speech and mind to meditation; 'ever engaged in the Yoga of meditation' means being like this, i.e., constantly engaged in the Yoga of meditation day after day until death; 'taking refuge in dispassion' means developing aversion to all objects except the one entity to be meditated upon, by considering the imperfections of all objects and thus cultivating detachment to everything.

Forsaking 'egoism' means abandoning the tendency to consider what is other than the self, as well as neutralising the power of forcible Vasnas (tendencies) which nourish (egoism), and the resulting pride, desire, wrath and possessiveness. 'With no feeling of mine' means free from the notion that what does not belong to oneself belongs to oneself; 'Who is tranil' means, who finds sole happiness in experiencing the self. One who has become like this and performs the Yoga of meditation becomes worthy for the state of Brahman. The meaning is that, freed from all bonds, he experiences the self as It really is.

18.51 Yuktah, being endowed; buddhya, with an intellect-which is identical with the faculty of determination; visuddhaya, pure, free from maya (delusion); and niyamya, controlling, subduing; atmanam, oneself, the aggregate of body and organs; dhrtya, with fortitude, with steadlines; tyaktva, rejecting; visayan, the objects; sabdadin, beginning from sound -from the context it follows that 'rejecting the objects' means rejecting all things which are meant for pleasure and are in excess of those meant only for the mere maintenance of the body; and vyudasya, eliminating; raga-dvesau, attachment and hatred with regard to things which come to hand for the maintenance of the body-.
Therefore,
18.52 Dwelling in solitude, eating but little, with speech, body and mind subdued, always engaged in meditation and concentration, resorting to dispassion.

18.52 Vivikta-sevi, one who resorts to solitude, is habituated to repairing into such solitary places as a forest, bank of a river, mountain caves, etc.; laghuasi, eats sparingly, is habituated to eating a little-repairing to solitary places and eating sparingly are nentioned here since they are the causes of tranillity of mind through the elimination of defects like sleep etc.-; the person steadfast in Knowledge, yata-vak-kaya-manasah, who has speech, body and mind under control. Having all his organs withdrawn thus, dhyana-yoga-parah nityam, one to whom meditation and concentration are ever the highest (duty)-meditation is thinking of the real nature of the Self, and concentration is making the mind one-pointed with regard to the Self itself; one to whom these meditation and concentration are the highest (duty) is dhyana-yoga-parah-. Nityam, (ever) is used to indicate the absence of other duties like repetition of mantra [A formula of prayer sacred to any deity.-V.S.A.] etc.
Samupasritah, one who is fully possessed, i.e. ever possessed; of vairagyam, dispassion, absence of longing for objects seen or unseen-.
Further,
18.53 Having abandoned egoism, strength, arrogance, desire, anger and covetousness, and free from the notion of 'mine' and peaceful,  he is fit for becoming Brahman.
18.53 Having abandoned selfishness, power, arrogance, anger and desire, possessing nothing of his own and having attained peace, he is fit to join the Eternal Spirit.
18.53. Relinshing egotism, violence, pride, desire, wrath, and the sense of possession-he, the unselfish and calm one, is capable of becoming the Brahman.
18.53 Forsaking egoism, power, pride, desire, wrath and possession, with no feeling of 'mine' and tranil - he becomes worthy for the state of brahman.
18.53 (That person,) having discarded egotism, force, pride, desire, anger and superfluous possessions, free from the idea of possession, and serene, is fit for becoming Brahman.
18.51 - 18.53 'Endowed with a purified understanding' means endowed with the Buddhi capable of understanding the self as it is in reality; 'subduing the mind by steadiness' means making the mind fit for meditation by turning away from external and internal objects; 'relinishing sound and other objects of senses' means keeping them far away, casting aside love and hate occasioned by them (i.e., the sense objects).

18.53 (That person) vimucya, having discarded; ahan-karam, egotism, thinking of the body, organs, etc. as the ego; balam, force-which is associated with desire and attachment; not the other kind of strength consisting in the fitness of the body etc., becuase being natural it cannot be descarded-; darpam, pride, which follows elation and leads to transgresson of righteousness-for the Smrti says, 'An elated person becomes proud; a proud man transgresses righteousness' (Ap. Dh. Su. 1.13.4); kamam, desire; krodham, anger, aversion; parigraham, superfluous possessions-even after removing the defects in the organs and the mind, there arises the possibility of acceptance of gifts either for the maintenance of the body or for righteous duties; discarding them as well, i.e. becoming a mendicant of the param-hamsa class; nirmamah, free from the idea of possession, becoming devoid of the idea of 'me' and 'mine' even with regard to so much as one's body and life; and for the very same reason, santah, serene, withdrawn; the monk who is effortless and steadfast in Knowledge, kalpate, becomes fit; brahma-bhuyaya, for becoming Brahman.
18.54 Becoming Brahman, serene in the Self, he neither grieves nor desires, the same to all beings, he obtains supreme devotion to Me.
18.54 And when he becomes one with the Eternal, and his soul knows the bliss that belongs to the Self, he feels no desire and no regret, he regards all beings equally and enjoys the blessing of supreme devotion to Me.
18.54. Having become the Brahman, the serene-minded one neither grieves nor rejoices; remaining eal to all beings, he gains the highest devotion to Me.
18.54 Having realised the state of Brahman, tranil, he neither grieves nor craves. Regarding all beings alike, he attains supreme devotion to Me.
18.54 One who has become Brahman and has attained the blissful Self does not grieve or desire. Becoming the same towards all beings, he attains supreme devotion to Me.
18.54 'Having realised the state of Brahman,' means having got from revelation an understanding of the nature of the self as consisting of unlimited knowledge and of being a Sesa (subservient being) to Me. Subservience to Me has been posited in, 'Know that which is other than this (Prakrti or lower Nature) to be the higher Prakrti of Mine' (7.5). One who is 'tranil' means one who is not contaminated by various forms of grief (the five Klesas of Yoga-sutras), and does not grieve about any being other than Myself, nor desires anything other than Myself. On the other hand, he becomes eally indifferent to all beings other than Myself as worthless as straw and attains supreme Bhakti for Me. He attains 'supreme devotion' to Me, which is of the form of an experience which makes Me dear beyond all description - Me the Lord of all, to whom creation, protection and dissolution of the universe is a sport, who is devoid of the slightest trace of evil, who is the sole seat of countless hosts of auspicious attributes which are excellent and unlimited; and who is the ocean of the elixir of beauty; who is the Lord of Sri; who is Lotus-eyed; and who is the self's own Lord.

Sri Krsna declares the fruits of this (devotion):
18.54 See Comment under 18.60
18.54 Brahma-bhutah, one who has become Brahman, attained Brahman through the above process; and prasanna-atma, [Prasada means the manifestation of the supreme Bliss of the Self as a result of the total cessation of all evils. Prasanna-atma is one who has attained this in the present life itself.] has attained the blissful Self, the indwelling Self; na, does not; socati, grieve-does not lament for the loss of something or the lack of some ality in oneself; nor kanksati, desire. By saying 'he does not grieve nor desire', this nature of one who has attained Brahman is being restated. For it does not stand to reason that in the case of a knower of Brahman there can be any hankering for something unattained. Or, (in place of kanksati) teh reading may be na hrsyati, does not become elated.
Becoming samah, the same; sarvesu bhutesu, towards all being-i.e., he verily judges what is happiness and sorrow in all beings by the same standard as he would apply to himself (cf. 6.32); but the meaning is not 'seeing the Self alike in all beings', for this will be spoken of in (the next verse), 'Through devotion he knows Me'-; he, the one who is of this kind and steadfast in Knowledge, labhate, attains; param, supreme; madbhaktim, devotion to Me, to the supreme Lord; (he attains) devotion which is described as Knowledge, as the 'fourth' in, '৷৷.four classes of people৷৷.adore Me' (7.16).
Then,
18.55 By devotion he knows Me in truth, what and who I am; then having known Me in truth, he forthwith enters into the Supreme.
18.55 By such devotion, he sees Me, who I am and what I am; and thus realising the Truth, he enters My Kingdom.
18.55. Through devotion he comes to know of Me :  Who I am and how, in fact, I am-having correctly  known Me, he enters Me.  Then afterwards,
18.55 Through devotion, he comes to know Me fully - who and what I am in reality, who I am and how I am. Knowing Me thus in truth, he forthwith enters into Me.
18.55 Through devotion he knows Me in reality, as to what and who I am. Then, having known Me in truth, he enters (into Me) immediately after that (Knowledge).
18.55 Through such devotion, he knows 'who I am,' i.e., knows My own essence and My nature, and 'what I am,' i.e., in My attributes and glory. Knowing Me truly, he rises to a higher level than this Bhakti, and aciring knowledge of the truth, enters into Me through devotion. The meaning is that he attains Me by means of infinite and unsurpassed Bhakti which develops subseent in time to the vision of the nature, attributes and glory of the Lord in reality. Here the term 'Tatah' (through) denotes that devotion is the cause of attainment; for it has been stated to be the cause of entrance n the text, 'But by singel-minded devotion it is possible ৷৷.' (11.54).

In this way, the crowning development has been told starting from the disinterested performance of periodical and occasional rites suitable for the various stations and stages of life, which are to be performed to propitiate the Supreme Person. Sri Krsna now explains that even for actions meant for attaining desired objects (Kamya-karmas) the crowning stage is the same as for these described above, provided they too are done not for fulfilling one's desires but as offerings to propitiate the Supreme Person.

18.55 Bhaktya, through devotion, through that devotion described as Knowledge; abhijanati, he knows; mam, Me; tattvatah, in reality; as to yavan, what I am, with the extensive differences created by limiting adjuncts; and yah asmi, who I am when all distinctions create by the limiting adjuncts are destroyed-Me who am the supreme Person comparable to space [In points of all-pervasiveness and non-attachment.] and one-without-a-second, absolute, homogeneous Consciousness, birthless, ageless, immortal, fearless and deathless.
Tatah, then; jnatva, having known; mam, Me, thus; tattvatah, in truth; visate, he enters into Me, Myself; tadanantaram, immediately after that (Knowledge). Here, by saing, 'having known, he enters without delay', it is not meant that the acts of 'knowing' and 'entering immediately after' are different. What then? What is meant is the absolute Knowledge itself that has to no other result, [In place of phalantarabhava-jnana-matram eva, Ast. reads 'phalantarbhavat jnanamatram eva, absolute Knowledge itself, since there is no other result'.-Tr.] for it has been said, 'And৷৷.understand Me to be the "Knower of the field", (13.2).
Opponent: Has it not been contradictory to say, he knows Me through that which is the supreme steadliness (nistha) in Knowledge?
Vedantin: If it be asked, How it is contradictory?
Opponent: The answer is: Whenever any Knowledge of something arises in a knower, at that very moment the knower knows that object. Hence, he does not depend on steadfastness in Knowledge which consists in the repetition of the act of knowing. And therefore, it is contradictory to say one knows not through knowledge, but through steadfastness in knowledge which is a repetition of the act of knowing.
Vedantin: There is no such fault, since the culmination of Knowledge-which (Knowledge) is associated with the causes of its unfoldment and maturity, and which has nothing to contradict it- in the conviction that one's own Self has been realized is what is referred to by the word nistha (consummation): When knowledge-which concerns the identity of the 'Knower of the field' and the supreme Self, and which remains associated with the renunciation of all actions that arise from the perception of the distinction among their accessories such as agent etc., and which unfolds from the instruction of the scriptures and teachers, depending on purity of the intellect etc. and humility etc. which are the auxiliary cuases of the origin and maturity of Knowledge-continues in the form of the conviction that one's own Self has been realized, then that continuance is called the supreme steadfastness (nistha) in Knowledge.
This steadfastness in Knowledge that is such has been spoken of as the highest, the fourth kind of devotion in relation to the three other devotions viz of the afflicted, etc. (cf. 7.16). Through that highest devotion one realizes the Lord in truth. Immediately after that the idea of difference between the Lord and the Knower of the field vanishes totally. There-fore the statement, 'one knows Me through devotion in the form of steadfastness in Knowledge', is not contradictory. And, in this sense, all the scriptures-consisting of Vedanta (Upanisads etc.), History, Mythology and Smrtis-, as for instance, 'Knowing (this very Self the Brahmanas) renounce৷৷.and lead a mendicant's life' (Br. 3.5.1), 'Therefore they speak of monasticism as excellent among these austerities' (Ma. Na. 24.1), 'Monasticism verily became supreme' (ibid. 21.2), which enjoin renunciation become meaningful. Thus, monasticism means renunciation of rites and duties. There are also the texts, 'Having renounced the Vedas as well as this world and the next' (Ap. Dh. Su. 2.9.13), and 'Give up religion and irreligion' (Mbh. Sa. 329.40; 331.44), etc. And here (in the Gita) also various relevant) passages have been pointed out. In is not porper that those texts should be meaningless. Nor are they merely eulogistic, since they occur in their own contexts. Besides, Liberation consists in being established in the changeless real nature of the indwelling Self. Indeed, it is not possible that one who wants to go to the eastern sea and the other who wants to go in the opposite direction to the western sea can have the same course!
And steadfastness in Knowledg consists in being totally absorbed in maintaining a current of thought with regard to the indwelling Self. And that is opposed to coexistence with duties, like going to the western sea. It has been the conclusion of those versed in the valid means of knowledge that the difference between them is as wide as that between a mountain and a mustard seed! Therefore it is established that one should have recourse to steadfastness in Knowledge only, by relinishing all rites and duties.
The fruit of the attainment of success from the Yoga of Devotion consisting in worshiping the Lord with one's own actions is the ability to remain steadfast in Knowledge, from which, follows stead-fastness in Knowledge, culminating in the result, Liberation. That Yoga of Devotion to the Lord is now being praised in this concluding section dealing with the purport of the Scripture, with a veiw to generating a firm conviction with regard to it (the purport of the Scripture):
18.56 Doing all actions always having taken refuge in Me, by My grace he obtains the eternal indestructible state of being.
18.56 Relying on Me in all his action and doing them for My sake, he attains, by My Grace, Eternal and Unchangeable Life.
18.56. Performing all [his] actions all the time and taking refuge in Me, he attains, through My Grace, the eternal, changeless state.
18.56 Taking refuge in Me and performing all works constantly, one, by My grace, attains the eternal and immutable realm.
18.56 Ever engaging even in all actions, one to whom I am the refuge, attains the eternal, immutable State through My grace.
18.56 'Taking refuge in Me' means leaving agency etc., to Me. He who performs 'all works constantly' means works that are not only obligatory and occasional acts but even those meant to fulfil desires (Kamya Karmas) - he attains, by My grace, the eternal realm which is immutable. 'Pada' means that which is attained. The meaning is that he attains Me. [The idea is that the performance of even those ritualistic actions enjoined for those having the fulfilment of certain desires in view, even these actions, if done without any such desire but only as the worship of the Supreme Person - the have the same effect as the performance of the enjoined daily and occasional rituals to which no effect except the purification of the self is offered by the Sastras.]

Since it is so, therefore:
18.56 See Comment under 18.60
18.56 Sada, ever; kurvanah api, engaging even in; sarva-karmani, all actions, even the prohibited ones; madvyapasrayah, one to whom I am the refuge, to whom I, Vasudeva the Lord, am the refuge, i.e. one who has totally surrendered himself to Me; even he, apnoti, attains; the sasvatam, eternal; avyayam, immutable; padam, State of Visnu; mat-prasadat, through My, i.e. God's, grace.
Since this is so, therefore,
18.57 Mentally renouncing all actions in Me, having Me as the highest goal, resorting to the Yoga of discrimination do thou ever fix thy mind on Me.
18.57 Surrender then thy actions unto Me, live in Me, concentrate thine intellect on Me, and think always of Me.
18.57. [Hence] renouncing by mind all actions in Me, O descendant of Bharata, and taking hold of the knowledge-Yoga,  you must always be with your thought-organ [turned] towards Me.
18.57 Surrendering all acts to me by your mind, thinking of Me as the goal, and resorting to Buddhi-yoga, focus your thought ever on Me.
18.57 Mentally surrendering all actions to Me and accepting Me as the supreme, have your mind ever fixed on Me by resorting to the concentration of your intellect.
18.57 'By your mind' means with thought which considers the self as belonging to Me and as controlled by Me. For, it has been declared:  'Surrendering all your acts to Me with a mind focussed on the self' (3.30). Surrendering all acts to Me along with agentship and the object of worship and regarding 'Me as the goal,' i.e., constantly contemplating that I alone am to be attained as the goal; performing all acts; and resorting to Buddhi-Yoga  - focus your mind on Me always. Buddhi Yoga here implies the mental attitude special to the seeker of salvation in regard to agency of works, the fruits etc.

Thus
18.57 See Comment under 18.60
18.57 Cetasa, mentally, with a discriminating intellect; sannyasya, surrendering; sarva-karmani, all actions meant for seen or unseen results; mayi, to Me, to God, in the manner described in, 'Whatever you do, whatever you eat' (9.27); and matparah, accepting Me as the supreme-you to whom I, Vasudeva, am the supreme, are matparah; becoming so; satatam, ever; maccittah bhava, have your kind fixed only on Me; upasritya, by resorting-resorting implies not taking recourse to anything else-; buddhi-yogam, to the concentration of your intellect. Having the intellect (buddhi) concentrated on Me is buddhi-yoga.
18.58 Fixing thy mind on Me, thou shalt by My grace overcome all obstacles; but if from egoism thou wilt not hear Me, thou shalt perish.
18.58 Fix but thy mind on Me, and by My grace thou shalt overcome the obstacles in thy path. But if, misled by pride, thou wilt not listen, then indeed thou shalt be lost.
18.58. Having your thought-organ turned towards Me, you shall pass over all obstacles by  Me Grace.  On the other hand, if you don't give up your sense of ego, you will not liberated yourself,  [instead] you will perish.
18.58 Focusing your thought on Me, you shall, by My grace, cross over all difficulties. If, however, out of self-conceit, you do not heed Me, you shall perish.
18.58 Having your mind fixed on Me, you will cross over all difficulties through My grace. If, on the other hand, you do not listen out of egotism, you will get destroyed.
18.58 Thus, focusing your thought on Me, if you can perform all acts, you will, by My grace, cross over all difficulties of Samsara. If, however, out of 'self-conceit,' i.e., out of the feeling, 'I know well what is to be done and what is not to be done' - out of such a feeling, if you do not heed My words, you shall perish. Except Myself, there is none who knows what ought and what ought not to be done by all living beings; there is also none other than Myself who is in the position of a law-giver to them.
18.58 See Comment under 18.60
18.58 Maccittah, having your mind fixed on Me; tarisyasi, you will cross over; sarva-durgani, alldifficulties, all cuases of transmigration which are difficult to overcome; mat-prasadat, through My grace. Atha cet, if, on the other hand; tvam, you; na srosyasi, will not listen to, will not accept, My words; ahankarat, out of egotism, thinking 'I am learned'; then vinanksyasi, you will get destroyed, will court ruin.
And this should not be thought of by you-'I am independent. Why should I follow another's bidding?'
18.59 If, filled with egoism, thou thinkest: "I will not fight", vain is this, thy resolve; Nature will compel thee.
18.59 If thou in thy vanity thinkest of avoiding this fight, thy will shall not be fulfilled, for Nature herself will compel thee.
18.59. In case, holding fast to the sense of ego, you think (decide)   'I shall not fight', that resolve of yours will be just useless.  [For] your own natural condition will incite you  [to fight].
18.59 If, in your self-conceit, you think, 'I will not fight,' your resolve is in vain. Nature will compel you.
18.59 That you think 'I shall not fight', by relying on egotism,-vain is this determination of yours. (Your) nature impel you!
18.59 If, in your 'self-conceit,' i.e., under a false sense of independence that you know what is good for you and what is not - if, not heeding My ?nd, you think, 'I will not fight,' then this resolve based on your sense of independence will be in vain. For Nature will compel you to go against your resolve - you who are ignorant and who adversely react to my sovereignty.

He elucidates the same:
18.59 See Comment under 18.60
18.59 Yat, that; manyase, you think, resolve; this-'na yotsye, I shall not fight'; asritya, by relying; on ahankaram, egotism, mithya, vain; is esah, this; vyava-sayah, determination; te, of yours; because prakrtih, nature, your own nature of a Ksatriya; niyoksyati, will impell; ;tvam, you!
18.6 But even these actions should be performed leaving aside attachment and the desire for rewards, O Arjuna; this is My certain and best conviction.
18.6 But they should be done with detachment and without thought of recompense. This is my final judgment.
18.6. Even these actions too must be performed by relinishing attachment and fruits :  This is my considered best opinion, O son of Prtha !
18.6 It is My decided and final view that even these acts should be done, O Arjuna, with relinishment of attachment and the fruits thereof.
18.6 But even these actions have to be undertaken by renouncing attachment and (hankering for) results. This is My firm and best conclusion, O Parhta.
18.6 Since sacrifices, gifts, austerities etc., are the means for the purification of the wise, therefore, it is My decided and final view that they should be performed as a part of my worship until one's death, renouncing attachment, viz., possessiveness towards actions and their fruits.
18.6 See Comment under 18.11
18.6 Tu, but; api, even; etani, these; karmani, actions, viz sacrifice, charity and austerity, which have been spoken of as purifiers; kartavyani, have to be undertaken; tyaktva, by renouncing; sangam, attachment to them; and by giving up (hankering for) their phalani, results. Iti, this; is me, My; niscitam, firm; and uttamam, best; matam, conculsion.
Having promised, 'hear from Me the firm conclusion regarding that (tyaga)' (4) and also adduced the reason that they are purifiers, the utterance, 'Even these actions have to be performed. This is the firm and best conclusion', is only by way of concluding the promised subject-matter; this sentence does not introduce a fresh topic. For it stands to reason that the phrase 'even these' refers to some immediate topic under discussion. The implication of the word api (even) is: 'Even these acts, which are causes of bondage to one who has attachment and who hankers after their results, have to be undertaken by a seeker of Liberation.' But the phrase 'even these' is not used in relation to other acts.
Others explain (thus): Since the nityakarmas have no results, therefore (in their case) it is illogical to say, 'by giving up attachment and (hankering for their) results'. The meaning of the phrase etani api (even these) is that, 'even these rites and duties, which are undertaken for desired results and are different from the nityakarmas, have to be undertaken. What to speak of the nityakarmas like sacrifice, charity and austerity!'
(Reply:) This is wrong since it has been established by the text, 'sacrifice, charity and austerity are verily the purifiers,' that even the nityakarmas have results. For a seeker of Liberation who wants to give up even the nityakarmas from fear of their being causes of bondage, how can there be any association with actions done for desired results? Moreover, the phrase etani api cannot apply to actions done for desired results (kamyakarmas), since they have been denigrated in, '৷৷.indeed, actions is ite inferior' (2.49), and in, '৷৷.by actions other than that action meant for God' (3.9), and since, on the strength of the texts [Which support the two earlier arguments.], 'the Vedas have the three alities as their object' (2.45), 'Those who are versed in the Vedas, who are drinkers of Soma,৷৷.(pray for the heavenly goal by worshipping) Me' (9.20), and 'they enter into the human world on the exhaustion of their merit' (9.21), it has been definitely stated that actions done for desired results are causes of bondage; and also because they are far removed from the context.
18.60 O Arjuna, bound by thy own Karma (action) born of thy own nature, that which from delusion thou wishest not to do, even that thou shalt do helplessly.
18.60 O Arjuna! Thy duty binds thee. From thine own nature has it arisen, and that which in thy delusion thou desire not to do, that very thing thou shalt do. Thou art helpless.
18.60. O son of Kunti !  Being bound fully by your own  duty, born of your own nature, and also being [hence] not independent, you would perform what you do not wish to perform, because of your-delusion.
18.60 O Arjuna, bound by your own duty born out of your own inner disposition, and having no control over your own will, you will be compelled to do that very thing which you now desire not to do through delusion.
18.60 Being bound by your own duty born of nature, O son of Kunti, you, being helpless, will verily do that which you do not wish to do owing to indiscrimination.
18.60 For, heroism is the duty of a Ksatriya born of his nature. Impelled by your own duty of heroism born of your own nature, you will lose self-control when you get the taunts of your enemies. Unable to suffer it, you will be compelled to engage them in battle, which, now, out of delusion and ignorance, you do not desire to do.

All beings have been ordained by Me to follow their Prakrti acired by their previous Karmas. Listen about it:
18.41-60 Brahmana - etc. upto avasopitat.  Surely the intrinsic nature of the Brahmanas etc., does not voilate what has been  difined (above) by way of classifying their duties.  Therefore, as far as you are concerned, you have the intrinsic ality of the Ksatriya (warrior), and your nature i.e., intrinsic ality, does, without fail, assume the part of the inciter of yourself, even though you don't like it.  For, a person who acts simply being incited by that (natural condition), there is the strong bondage of the merit or demerit. Therefore, perform actions following the means of correct knowledge, taught by Me.  In that case, the bondage would disappear.  The intention of the principal sentence  (statement of the entire passage under study) is to help to get this idea.  The meaning of the subordinate sentences (statements) is evident.
 
Briefly  (verse 50) :  in short.  Knowledge : i.e. the one which has been explained earlier.  Nistha conveys, avoiding verbal jugglary, the meaning  'what has been determined'.  He who is endowed with intellect totally pure etc. :  All this has been almost explained already.  Hence, no more trouble is taken [to comment upon it].
18.60 And because of nibaddhah, being securely bound; svena, by your own; karmana, duty; svabhavajena, born of nature [Svabhava means those tendencies which are created by good bad actions performed in previous births, and which become the cause of performance of duties, renunciation, experience of happiness, sorrow, etc. in the present birth.-S.]-herosim etc. as stated (in 43); O son of Kunti, you avasah, being helpless, under another's control; karisyasi api, will verily do; tat, that duty; yat, which duty; you na, do not; icchasi, wish; kartum, to do; mohat, owing to indiscrimination.
For,
18.61 The Lord dwells in the hearts of all beings, O Arjuna, causing all beings, by His illusive power, to revolve as if mounted on a machine.
18.61 God dwells in the hearts of all beings, O Arjuna! He causes them to revolve as it were on a wheel by His mystic power.
18.61. O Arjuna !  This Lord dwells in the heart of all beings, causing, by His trick-of-Illusion, all beings to whirl round [as if they are]  mounted on a [revolving] mechanical contrivance.
18.61 The Lord, O Arjuna, abides in the heart of every being, spinning them round and round, mounted on a wheel as it were, by His power.
18.61 O Arjuna, the Lord resides in the region of the heart of all creatures, revolving through Maya all the creatures (as though) mounted on a machine!
18.61 Lord Vasudeva, who is the ruler over all, lives in 'the heart of all beings,' i.e., in the region from which arises all knowledge which is at the root of all secular and spiritual activities. How and doing what does He exist?  He exists enabling, by His Maya (power), 'all beings who are mounted, as it were, on the machine Prakrti' in the form of body and senses created by Himself, to act in accordance with their Gunas of Sattva and others. It was already expressed in 'And I am seated in the hearts of all. From Me are memory, knowledge and their removal also' (15.15) and in 'From Me proceed everything' (10.8). The Srutis also proclaim 'He who, dwelling in the self' (Br. U. Madh., 3.7.22).

He now explains the way to get rid of the Maya:
18.61 See Comment under 18.62
18.61 Arjuna, O Arjuna-one whose self is naturally white (pure), i.e. one possessing a pure internal organ. This follows from the Vedic text, 'The day is dark and the day is arjuna (white) (Rg. 6.9.1). Isvarah, the Lord , Narayana the Ruler; tisthati, resides, remains seated; hrd-dese, in the region of the heart; sarva-bhutanam, of all creatures, of all living beings. How does He reside? In answer the Lord says: bhramayan, revolving; mayaya, through Maya, through delusion; sarva-bhutani, all the creatures; as though yantra-arudhani, mounted on a machine-like man' etc., made of wood, mounted on a machine. The word iva (as though) has to be thus understood here. Bhramayan, revolving, is to be connected with tisthati, resides (conveying the idea, 'resides৷৷.while revolving').
18.62 Fly unto Him for refuge with all thy being, O Arjuna; by His grace thou shalt obtain supreme peace (and) the eternal abode.
18.62 With all thy strength, fly unto Him and surrender thyself, and by His grace shalt thou attain Supreme Peace and reach the Eternal Home.
18.62. To Him alone you must go for refuge with all your thought,  O descendant of Bharata !  Through My Grace you will attain the success, the eternal abode.
18.62 Seek refuge in Him alone, O Arjuna, with the whole of your being. By His grace, you shall find supreme peace and eternal abode.
18.62 Take refuge in Him alone with your whole being, O scion of the Bharata dynasty. Through His grace you will attain the supreme Peace and the eternal Abode.
18.62 Such being the case, take refuge with all your heart (Sarvabhavena), by every disposition of your body, senses and mind (Sarvatmana) in Him - Him, the ruler of all, who has become your charioteer out of compassion for dependents, and who orders you, 'Act thus' and so on. Even if you do not do so now, fighting in battle etc., is inevitable for you who are ignorant and actuated by His Maya, but then you will get ruined. Therefore, fight etc., in the manner which has been explained by Him. Such is the meaning.

Acting in this way, you will attain supreme peace, release from all bondage, and the eternal abode. Hundreds of Srutis declare it:  'That supreme place of Visnu which the sages see' (Rg. S., 1.2.6.5); 'They become meritorious and reach this heaven where Devas and Sadhyas dwell' (Tai. A., 3.12); 'Where dwell the ancient sages, the first-born' (Tai.Sam., 4.7.13.1); 'The supreme place above the paradise in the heart of the Supreme Heaven' (Ma. Na., 8.14); 'He who is in the Supreme Heaven and presides over this' (Rg. S., 8.7.17.7); 'Now that light which shines above this Supreme Heaven' (Cha. U., 3.13.7); and 'He reaches the end of the journey, the Highest abode of Visnu' (Ka. U., 3.9).
18.61-62 Isvarah etc.  Tam eva etc.  This Lord, the Supreme Self, must be taken hold of as refuge.  When that Supreme Ruler, the [real]  Agent-of-all-actions, the  [real]  Knower, the very Self of your own, is reflected upon, there (in the heart) the [effects of]  actions do not enjoy any locus standi.  Indeed, the deer-calves which are of wavering mind [by nature] and are noted only for their power of running away to escape, do not take recourse to their skill in pursuing freely their [usual] activities while there dwells in the [nearby]  cave a loin-calf, the glory of whose valour has been made evident by the accessories in the form of the heaps of pearls scattered from the elephants'  temples broken upon with the very sharp  edges of his (lion-calf's)  excellent claws.
 
By the cocluding statement that  commences  'To Him alone you must go for refuge' and [runs] as  'Through My Grace etc.',  the Bhagavat indicates the Lord Supreme Self, and Vasudeva krsna to be identical.
18.62 Gaccha saranam, take refuge; tam eva, in Him, the Lord alone; sarva-bhavena, with your whole being, for getting rid of your mundane sufferings, O scion of the Bharata dynasty. Tat-prasadat, through His grace, through God's grace; prapsyasi, you will attain; param, the supreme; santim, Peace, the highest Tranillity; and the sasvatam, eternal; sthanam, Abode, the supreme State of Mine who am Visnu.
18.63 Thus has wisdom, more secret than secrecy itself, been declared unto thee by Me; having reflected over it fully, then act as thou wishest.
18.63 Thus have I revealed to thee the Truth, the Mystery of mysteries. Having thought it over, thou art free to act as thou wilt.
18.63. Thus the [path of] wisdom, a better secret  than all the secrets has been expounded to you by Me; comprehend it fully and then act as you please.
18.63 Thus the knowledge, the mystery of mysteries, has been declared to you be Me. Reflecting on it fully, do what you will.
18.63 To you has been imparted by Me this knowledge [Derived in the instrumental sense of 'means of knowledge'; i.e. the scripture Gita.] which is moe secret than any secret. Pondering over this as a whole, do as you like.
18.63 Thus, in this manner, has been set forth everything that is to be acired by those aspirants for release - the mystery of mysteries, concerning Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga. Reflecting on it fully, do what you wish to do according to your alification - i.e., follow Karma Yoga, or Jnana Yoga or Bhakti Yoga according to your liking. Such is the meaning.
18.63 Iti te etc. : The [path of] wisdom has been taught to you.  It is a better secret than the secret literature i.e.,  the last portion of the Vedas  (the Upanisads), as it reveals the supreme Non-duality  (Advaita-philosophy).  Comprehend it fully and then :  Deliberate on the purport of it and then.				
 The purport has been, no doubt, elucidated by us by taking-by-horn-method  (directly)  whenever occasion arose.  Yet, a clear reflection of the entire subject matter is shown here.  Because it is the choicest one, the mind is never satisfied, when it is being elucidated and listened to.  The most secret thing is being determined here. The method by which that is known, you must listen to now - so He says :-
18.63 Te, to you; akhyatam, has been imparted, spoken of; maya, by Me who am the omniscient God; iti, this; jnanam, knowledge; which is guhyataram, more secret; guhyat, than any secret-i.e. it is extremely profound, mystical. Vimrsya, pondering over, contemplating on; etat, this, the Scripture as imparted; asesena, as a whole, and also on all the subjects dealt with; kuru, do; yatha icchasi tatha, as you like.
'Once again, hear what is beng said by Me:'
18.64 Hear thou again My supreme word, most secret of all; because thou art dearly beloved of Me, I will tell thee what is good.
18.64 Only listen once more to My last word, the deepest secret of all; thou art My beloved, thou are My friend, and I speak for thy welfare.
18.64. Yet again, you must listen to My ultimate (or supreme) message which is the highest secret of all.  You are My dear one and have a firm intellect.  Hence I shall tell you what is good to you :
18.64 Hear again My supreme word, the most secret of all; as you are exceedingly loved by Me, I am telling what is good for you.
18.64 Listen again to My highest utterance which is the profoundest of all. Since you are ever dear to Me, therefore I shall speak what is beneficial to you.
18.64 It has been said that Bhakti Yoga is the most secret of all secrets, in such texts as 'I will declare to you, who does not cavil, this most mysterious knowledge' (9.1). Hear again My supreme word concerning it (i.e., Bhakti Yoga). As you are exceedingly dear to Me, therefore, I shall declare what is good for you.
18.64 See Comment under 18.65
18.64 Srnu, listen; bhuyah, again; to me, My; paramam, highest; vacah, utternace; which is sarva-guhyatamam, profundest of all, most secret of all secrets, though it has been repeatedly stated. Neither from fear nor even for the sake of money am I speaking! What then? Iti, since, considering that; asi, you are; drdham, ever, unwaveringly; istah, dear; me, to Me; tatah, therefore, for that reason; vaksyami, I shall speak; what is hitam, beneficial; te, to you, what is the highest means of attaining Knowledge. That is indeed the most beneficial of all beneficial things.
'What is that (You are going to tell me)?' In answer the Lord says:
18.65 Fix thy mind on Me, by devoted to Me, sacrifice to Me, bow down to Me. Thou shalt come even to Me; truly do I promise unto thee, (for) thou art dear to Me.
18.65 Dedicate thyself to Me, worship Me, sacrifice all for Me, prostrate thyself before Me, and to Me thou shalt surely come. Truly do I pledge thee; thou art My own beloved.
18.65. Be with your mind fixed in Me; be My devotee; offer oblation to Me and render salutation to Me; you shall come to Me alone.  Really I promise you, (because) you are dear to Me.
18.65 Focus your mind on Me. Be My devotee. Be My worshipper. Prostrate before Me. You shall come to Me alone. I promise you, trully; for you are dear to Me.
18.65 Have your mind fixed on Me, be My devotee, be a sacrificer to Me and bow down to Me. (Thus) you will come to Me alone. (This) truth do I pormise to you. (For) you are dear to Me.
18.65 What is enjoined in Vedanta texts such as 'I know the Great Person of the radiance of the sun, who is beyond this Prakrti. Knowing Him thus, one becomes here immortal; there is no path for immortality' (Sve. U., 3.8); what is designated by words such as knowledge (Vedanta), meditation (Dhyana) and worship (Upasana); what is of the form of direct perception (Darsana) having the character of continuous succession of memory of a surpassingly loving nature to the worshipped - it is this that is enjoined herein by the words 'Focus your mind on Me,' 'Be My devotee.' It means, be one to whom I am incomparably dear. Since I am the object of superabundant love, meditate on Me, i.e., practise the succession of memory of unsurpassed love of Me. Such is the meaning. Be My worshipper (yaji). Here also the expression, 'Be My devotee' is applicable. Yajna is worship. Worship Me as one exceedingly dear to you. Worship (Aradhana) is complete subservience to the Lord. Prostrate before Me. Prostration means bowing down. The meaning is:  Bow down humbly before Me with great love.

Renouncing thus all ego-centredness, you shall come to Me. I make this solemn promise to you. Do not take it as a mere flattery. For you are dear to Me. It has been already stated, 'For I am inexpressibly dear to the man of knowledge and dear is he to Me' (7.17). He in whom there is surpassing love for Me, I hold him also as surpassingly dear to Me. Conseently, not being able to bear separation from him, I myself will enable him to attain Me. It is this truth alone that has been solemnly declared to you in the expression that 'you shall come to Me alone.'
18.64-65 Sarva - etc.  Manmanah etc, By the portion  'Be with your mind fixed in Me' etc., it is determined that in the scriptures the importance completely lies only in dedicating [everything] to the Brahman; and it is declared that this present scripture  (the Holy Bhagavatgita) is of use [only] in the case of  one who cultivates [the attitude of]  dedication to the Brahman.  			
 Also He says -
18.65 Bhava manmana, have your mind fixed on Me; be mad-bhaktah, My devotee; be a madyaji,sacrificer to Me, be engaged in sacrifices to Me; namaskuru, bow down; mam, to Me. Offer ever your salutations to Me alone. Continuing thus in them, by surrendering all ends, means and needs to Vasudeva only, esyasi, you will come; mam, to Me; eva, alone. (This) satyam, truth: do I pratijane, promise; te, to you, i.e. in this matter I make this true promise. For, asi, you are; priyah, dear; me, to Me.
The idea conveyed by the passage is: Having thus understood that the Lord is true in His pormise, and knowing for certain that liberation is the unfailing result of devotion to the Lord, one should have dedication to God as his only supreme goal.
Having summed up surrender to God as the highest secret of steadiness in Karma-yoga, there-after, with the idea that complete realization, which is the fruit of adherence to Karma-yoga and which has been enjoined in all the Upanisads, has to be spoken about, the Lord says:
18.66 Abandoning all duties, take refuge in Me alone: I will liberate thee from all sins; grieve not.
18.66 Give up then thy earthly duties, surrender thyself to Me only. Do not be anxious; I will absolve thee from all thy sin.
18.66. Abandoning all attributes, come to Me as your sole refuge;  I shall rescue you from all sins; don't be sorrowful.
18.66 Completely relinishing all Dharmas, seek Me alone for refuge. I will release you from all sins. Grieve not:
18.66 Abandoning all forms of rites and duties, take refuge in Me alone. I sahll free you from all sins. (Therefore) do not grieve.
18.66 'Relinishing all Dharmas means the complete relinishment of the sense of agency, possessiveness, fruits etc., in the practising of Karma, Jnana and Bhakti Yogas in the way instructed, and the realising of Me as the agent, object of worship, the means and the end. It means that relinishment is not of all devotional duties but only of the sense of agency and the fruits. This is the Sastraic relinishment of all Dharmas. It is firmly established in the beginning of this chapter commencing from, 'Listen regarding My decision, O Arjuna, about abandonment; for abandonment is declared to be of three kinds' (18.4), and 'Renouncing attachments and also the fruit, such abandonment is regarded as Sattvika ৷৷. for it is impossible for one who bears the body to abandon acts entirely. But he who gives up the fruits of works, is called the abandoner' (18.9-11).

If you practise such abandonment of the sense of agency and fruits, I will release you from all 'sins' - i.e., I will release you from all evil incompatible with the attainment of Myself, consisting of innumerable acts of the nature of doing what ought not to be done and not doing what ought to be done. These piled up from beginningless times from the obstruction in the way. Grieve not, you should not despair; for I shall release you from all these obstructions.

Another (alternative) explanation is this:  Bhakti Yoga is possible only for those people to whom the Lord is exceedingly dear and who are free from all evils. Those evils are so huge in their case that the expiatory rites which could wash them off, could not be performed in the limited time of one's life span. Ajuna therefore thought that he was unfit for commencing Bhakti Yoga. To remove the grief of Arjuna the Lord said:  'Completely relinishing all Dharmas, seek Me alone for refuge.' Expiatory rites can be taken here as what is meant by Dharma, Completely forsake these rites (Dharmas) appropriate for the removal of numerous and varied sins piled up from beginningless time and obstructing the starting of Bhakti Yoga. The expiatory rites consist of practices like Krcchra, Candrayana, Kusmanda, Vaisvanara, Vratapati, Pavitresti, Trvrit, Agnistoma etc., which are of manifold varieties, and which are difficult to perform on account of the brevity of life. So in order to succeed in commencing Bhakti Yoga, seek Me alone for refuge. I am supremely compassionate, the refuge of all without considering the differences of character among them, and am an ocean of tenderness for those dependent on Me. I will release you from all evil, the nature of which has been explained as incompatible with the commencement of Bhakti Yoga. Grieve not. [Both these interpretations of this famous verse are said to teach only Bhakti Yoga and not Prapatti. But the estion will rise in one's mind - why should it not be so taken?]
18.66 Sarvadharman etc.  Abandoning all attributes :  This act of slaying the kinsmen and the like that arises incidentally while fighting a war - not owning those acts as your own attribute by your thought  'I am the doer of all these';  also giving up by mind, the notion  'If the act of slaying the teacher etc., is avoided, merit will accrue to me'.  come to Me:  Come to Me alone, the Agent-of-all-actions, the Supreme Lord, the Sovereign.  As your Refuge :  as the Guardian of all your natural impulses.  On that account I, the Omniscient, shall rescue you from all the sins.  Don't be sorrowful :  Don't get perplexed 'What to be done'.
18.66 Sarva-dharman, all forms of rites and duties: Here the word dharma (righteousness) includes adharma (unrighteousness) as well; for, what is intended is total renunciation of all actions, as is enjoined in Vedic and Smrti texts like, 'One who has not desisted from bad actions' (Ka. 1.2.24), 'Give up religions and irreligion' (Mbh. Sa. 329.40), etc.
Parityajya, abandoning all rites and duties; [Being a Ksatriya, Arjuna is not alified for steadfastness in Knowledge through monasticism in the primary sense. Still, the Gita being meant for mankind as a whole, monasticism is spoken of here by accepting Arjuna as a representative man.] saranam vraja, take refuge; mam ekam, in Me alone, the Self of all, the same in all, existing in all beings, the Lord, the Imperishable, free from being in the womb, birth, old age and death-by knowing that I am verily so. That is, know it for certain that there is nothing besides Me. By revealing My real nature, aham, I; moksayisyami, shall free; tva, you, who have this certitude of understanding; sarva-paphyah, from all sins, from all bondages in the form of righteousness and unrighteousness. It has also been stated, 'I, residing in their hearts, destroy the dark-ness born of ignorance with the luminous lamp of Knowledge' (10.11). Therefore, ma, do not; sucah, grieve, i.e. do not sorrow.
In this scripture, the Gita, has knowledge been established as the supreme means to Liberation, or is it action, or both?
Why does the doubt arise?
(Because) the passages like, '৷৷.by realizing which one attains Immortality' (13.12), 'Then, having known Me in truth, he enters (into Me) immediately after that (Knowledge)' (55), etc. point to the attainment of Liberation through Knowledge alone. Texts like, 'Your right is for action alone' (2.47), '(you undertake) action itself (4.15), etc. show that actions have to be under-taken as a matter of compulsory duty. Since both Knowledge and action are thus enjoined as duties, therefore the doubt may arise that they, in combination as well, may become the cause of Liberation.
Objection: What, again, would be the result of this iniry?
Vedantin: Well, the resut will verily be this: The ascertainment of one of these as the cuase of the highest good. Hence this has to be investigated more extensively.
Knowledge of the Self, however, is exclusively the cause of the highest good; for, through the removal of the idea of differences, it culminates in the result that is Liberation. The idea of distinction among action, agent and result is ever active with regard to the Self because of ignorance. This ignorance in the form, 'My work; I am the agent; I shall do this work for that resut', has been at work from time without beginning. The dispeller of this ignorance is this Knowledge regarding the Self-in the form, 'I am the absolute, non agent, free from action and result; there is none else other than myself because, when it (Knowledge) arises it despels the idea of differences which is the cause of engagement in action.
The word 'however' above is used for ruling out the other two alternatives. This refutes the two other alternative views by showing that the highest good cannot be attained through mere actions, nor by a combination of Knowledge and action. Besides, since Liberation is not a product, therefore it is illogical that it should have action as its means. Indeed, an eternal entity cannot be produced by either action of Knowledge.
Objection: In that case, ever exclusive Knowledge is purposeless.
Vedantin: No, since Knowledge, being the destroyer of ignorance, culminates in Liberation which is directly experienced result. The fact that Knowledge, which removes the darkness of ignorance, culminates in Liberation as its result is directly perceived in the same way as is the result of the light of a lamp which removes ignorance the form of sanke etc. and darkness from objects such as rope etc. Indeed, the result of light amounts to the mere (awareness of the) rope, free from the wrong notions of snake etc. So is the case with Knowledge.
As in the case of the acts like 'cutting down', 'producing fire by friction' etc., in which accessories such as the agent and others operate, and which have perceivable results, there is no possiblity of (the agent etc.) engaging in any other activity giving some other result apart from 'splitting into two', 'seeing (or lighting of) fire' etc, similarly, in the case of the agent and the other factors engaged in the 'act' of steadfastness in Knowledge which has a tangible result, there is no possibility of (their) engagement in any other action which has a result different from that in the form of the sole existence of the Self. Hence, steadfastness in Knowledge combined with action is not logical.
Objection: May it not be argued that this is possible like the acts of eating and Agnihotra sacrifice etc.? [As such a common action as eating can go hand in hand with such Vedic rites as the Agnihotra-sacrifice, so, actions can be combined with Knowledge.]
Vedantin: No, since it is unreasonable that, when Knowledge which resutls in Liberation is attained, there can remain a hankering for results of actions. Just as there is no desire for an action or its result [Action, i.e. digging etc.; result, i.e. bathing etc.] in connection with a well, pond, etc. when there is a flood all around, similarly when Knowledge which has Liberation for its result is attained there can be no possibility of hankering for any other result or any action which leads to it. Indeed, when somody is engaged in actions aimed at winning a kingdom, there can be no possibility of his engaging in any activity for securing a piece of land, or having a longing for it!
Hence, action does not constitute the means to the highest good. Nor do Knowledge and action in combination. Further, Knowledge which has Liberation as its result can have no dependence on the assistance of action, because, being the remover of ignorance, it is opposed (to action). Verily, darkness cannot be the dispeller of darkness. Therefore Knowledge alone is the means to the highest good.
Objection: Not so, because from non-performance of nityakarmas one incurs sin. Besides, freedom (of the Self) is eternal. As for the view that Liberation is attainable through Knowledge alone, it is wrong. For, if nityakarmas [As also the occasional duties (naimittika-karmas).] which are prescribed by the Vedas are not performed, then one will incur evil in the form of going to hell etc.
Counter-objection: If this be so, then, since Liberation cannot come from action, will there not arise the contingency of there being no Liberation at all?
Pseudo-Vedantin: Not so, for Liberation is eternal. as a result of performing nityakarmas there will not be incurring of evil, and as a result of not doing any prohibited action (nisiddha-karma) there will not be any possibility of birth in an undesirable body; from relinishing actions meant for desired results (kamya-karmas) there will be no possibility of being born in some desirable body. Since there is no cause to produce another body when the present body falls after the results of actions that produced this body get exhausted by experiencing them, and since one does not have attachment etc., therefore Liberation consists in the mere continuance of the Self in Its own natural state. Thus, Liberation is attained without effort.
Objection: May it not be argued that, since in the case of actions done in many past lives-which are calculated to yield such results as attainment of heaven, hell, etc. but have not commenced bearing results-there is no possiblity of their being experienced, therefore they cannot be exhausted?
Pseudo-Vedantin: No, since the suffering of pain from the effort involved in the nityakarmas can reasonably be (considered to be) the experiencing of their [i.e. of actions done in past lives, which have not commenced bearing their fruits.-Tr.] results. Or, since the nityakarmas, like expiations, may be considered as being meant for eliminating the sins incurred earlier, and since actions that have begun bearing their fruits get exhausted merely through their being experienced, therefore Liberation is attained without effort-provided no fresh actions are performed.
Vedantin: No, since there is the Upanisadic text, 'Knowing Him alone, one goes beyond death; there is no other way to go by' (Sv. 3.8), which states that for Liberation there is no other path but enlightenment; also because there is the Upanisadic statement that Liberation for an unenlightened person is as impossible as the rolling up of the sky like leather (Sv. 6.20); and since it is mentioned in the Puranas and the Smrtis that Liberation follows only from Knowledge.
(From your view) it also follows that there is no possibility of the exhaustion of the results of virtuous deeds which have not as yet begun yielding their fruits. And, as there is the possibility of the persistence of sins which were incurred in the past but have not yet commenced yielding results, similarly there can be the possibility of the persistence of virtues which have not yet begun bearing fruits. And so, if there be no scope of their being exhausted without creating another body, then there is no possibility of Liberation. And since attachment, hatred and delusion, which are the causes of virtue and vice, cannot be eradicated through any means other than Knowledge, therefore the eradication of virtue and vice becomes impossible. Besides, since the Sruti [See Ch. .2.23.1 and Br. 1.5.16-Tr.] mentions that nityakarmas have heaven as their result, and there is the Smrti text, 'Persons belonging to castes and stages of life, and engaged in their own duties' ['৷৷.attain to a high, immeasurable happiness.'-Tr.] (Ap. Dh. Su. 2.2.2.3), etc., therefore the exhaustion of (the fruits of) actions (through nityakarmas) is not possible.
As for those who say, 'The nityakarmas, being painful in themselves, must surely be the result of evil deeds done in the past; but apart from being what they are, they have no other result because this is not mentioned in the Vedas and they are enjoined on the basis of the mere fact that one is alive'-(this is) not so, because actions which have not become operative cannot yield any result. Besides, there is no ground for experiencing a particular conseence in the form of pain [Pain involved in the performance of nityakarmas.] The statement, that the pain one suffers from the effort involved in performing the nityakarmas is the result of sinful acts done in past lives, is false. Indeed, it does not stand to reason that the result of any action which did not become operative at the time of death to yield its fruit is experienced in a life produced by some other actions. Otherwise, there will be no reason why the fruit of some action that is to lead to hell should not be experienced in a life that is produced by such actions as Agnihotra etc. and is meant for enjoying the result in the form of heaven! Besides, that (pain arising from the effort in performing nityakarmas) cannot be the same as the conseence in the form of the particular suffering arising from sin.
Since there can be numerous kinds of sins with results productive of various kinds of sorrows, therefore, if it be imagined that their (sins') result will be merely in the form of pain arising from the effort in undertaking the nityakarmas, then it will certainly not be possible to suppose that they (the sins incurred in the past) are the causes of such obstacles as the pairs of opposites (heat and cold, etc.), disease etc., and that the result of sins incurred in the past will be only the pain arising from the exertion in performing nityakarmas, but not the sufferings like carrying stones on the head etc. Further, it is out of context to say this, that the pain resulting from the effort in performing nityakarmas is the result of sinful acts done in the past.
Objection: How?
Vedantin: What is under discussion is that the sin committed in the past, which has not begun to bear fruit, cannot be dissipated. In that context you say that pain resulting from the effort in undertaking nityakarmas is the result of action which has begun bearing fruit, not of that which has not yet commenced yielding fruit!
On the other hand, if you think that all sins committed in the past have begun yielding their results, then it is unreasonable to specify that the pain resulting from the exertion in performing the nitya-karmas is their only result. And there arises the contingency of the injunction to perform nityakarmas becoming void, because the sinful deed which has begun bearing fruit can ligically be dissipated only be experiencing its result. Further, if pain be the result of nityakarmas enjoined by the Vedas, then it is seen to arise from the very effort in undertaking nityakarmas-as in the case of excercise etc. To imagine that it is the result of something else is illogical. [The pain arising from bodily excercise is the result of the excercise itself, and not the result of any past sin! Similarly, the pain resulting from undertaking nityakarmas is the conseence of that performance itself, and need not be imagined to be the result of any past sin.]
And if the nityakarmas have been enjoined simply on the basis of a person's being alive, it is unreasonable that it should be the result of sins committed in the past, any more than expiation is. An expiation that has been enjoined following a particular sinful act is not the result of that sin! On the other hand, if the suffering arising from expiation be the reslut of that very sin which is its cause, then the pain from the effort in performing nityakarmas, though prescribed merely on the fact of one's being alive, may become the fruit of that very fact of one's being alive-which was itself the occasion (for enjoining the nityakarmas)-, because both the nityakarmas and expiatory duties are indistinguishable so far as their being occasioned by something is concerned.
Moreover, there is the other fact: There can be no such distinction that only the pain resulting from the performance of nityakarmas is the result of past sinful deeds, but not so the pain from performing kamya-karmas (rites and duties undertaken for desired results), because the pain in performing Agnihotra-sacrifice etc. is the same when it is performed as a nityakarma or as a kamya-karma. Thus the latter also may be the result of past sinful acts.
This being the case, it is untenable to assume on the ground of circumstantial inference that, since no result is enjoined in the Vedas for nityakarmas and since its prescription cannot be justified on any other ground, therefore pain from the effort in performing nityakarmas is the result of sinful past deeds. Thus, the (Vedic) injunction being unjustifiable otherwise, it can be inferred that nityakarmas have got some result other than the pain arising from the effort in undertaking them. It also involves this contradiction: It is contradictory to say that through the performance of nityakarma a result of some other action is experienced. And when this is admitted, it is again a contradiction to say that that very experience is the result of the nityakarma, and yet that niyakarma has no result!
Moreover, when Agnihotra and other sacrifices are performed for desirable results (Kamya-Agnihotra), then the Agnihotra etc. which are performed as nityakarma (Nitya-Agnihotra) become accomplished simultaneously (on a account of its being a part ofthe former). Hence, since the Kamya-Agnihotra (as an act) is dependent on and not different from the Nitya-Agnihotra, therefore the result of the Agnihotra and other sacrifices performed with a desire for results will get exhausted through the suffering involved in the exertion in undertaking it (the Nitya-Agnihotra). On the other hand, if the result of Kamya-Agnihotra etc. be different, viz heaven etc., then even the suffering arising from the exertion in performing them ought to be necessarily different (from the suffering involved in the Nitya-Agnihotra). And that is not the fact, because it contradicts what is directly perceived; for the pain resulting from the effort in performing only the Nitya-(-Agnihotra) does not differ from the pain resulting from the exertion in undertaking the Kamya (-Agnihotra).
Besides, there is this other consideration: Actions which have not been enjoined or prohibited (by the scriptures) produce immediate results. But those enjoined or prohibited by the scriptures do not produce immediate results; were they to do so, then there would be no effort even with regard to heaven etc. and injunctions concerning unseen results.
And it cannot be imagined that only the fruit of (Nitya-) Agnihotra etc. gets exhausted through the suffering arising from the effort in performing them, but the Kamya (-Agnihotra) has exalted results like heaven etc. merely as a conseence of the fact of desire for results, though as acts there is no essential difference between them (the Nitya and the Kamya) and there is no additional subsidiary part, processes of performance, etc. (in the kamya-Agnihotra). Therefore, it can never be established that nitya-karmas have no unseen results. And hence, enlightenment alone, not the performance of nityakarmas, is the cuase of the total dissipation of actions done through ignorance, be they good or bad. For, all actions have for their origin ignorance and desire.
Thus has it been established (in the following passages) that action (rites and duties) is meant for the ignorant, and steadfastness in Knowledge-after renunciation of all actions-is meant for the enlightened: 'both of them do not know' (2.19); 'he who knows this One as indestructible, eternal' (2.21); 'through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization; through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' (3.3); 'the ignorant, who are attached to work' (3.26); 'But৷৷.the one who is a knower৷৷.does not become attached, thinking thus: "The organs rest on the objects of the organs"' (3.28); 'The embodied man৷৷.having given up all actions mentally, continues' (5.13); 'Remaining absorbed in the Self, the knower of Reality should think, "I certainly do not do anything"' (5.8); i.e; the unenlightened person thinks, 'I do'; 'For (the sage) who wishes to ascend (to Dhyana-yoga), action is said to be the means৷৷.when he has ascended (when he is established in the Yoga of Meditation), inaction alone is said to be the means' (6.3); 'noble indeed' are all the three (classes of) unenlightened persons, 'but the man of Knowledge is the very Self. (This is) My opinion' (7.18); the unenlightened who perform their rites and duties, 'who are desirous of pleasures, attain the state of going and returning' (9.21); 'becoming non-different from Me and meditative' (9.22) and endowed with steadfast devotion, they worship (Me) the Self which has been described as comparable to space and taintless; and 'I grant that possession of wisdom by which they reach Me' (10.10); i.e., the unenlightened persons who perform rites and duties 'do not reach Me.'
Those who perform works for the Lord and who, though they be the most devout, are ignorant persons performing rites and duties,-they remain involved in practices which, in a descending order, culminate in giving up the fruit of actions (cf. 12.6-11). But those who meditate on the indefinable Immutable take recourse to the disciplines stated in the passages beginning with 'He who is not hateful towards any creature' (12.13) and ending with that Chapter, and also resort to the path of Knowledge presented in the three chapters beginning with the Chapter on the 'field'. The three results of actions, viz the undesirable etc. (cf. 12), do not accrue only to the mendicants belonging to the Order of Paramahamsas (the highest Order of monks)-who have renounced all actions that originate from the five causes beginning with the locus (cf. 14), who possess the knowledge of the oneness and non-agentship of the Self (17,20), who continue in the supreme steadfastness in Knowledge, who know the real nature of the Lord, and who have taken refuge in the unity of the real nature of the Lord with the Self. It does accrue to the others who are not monks, the ignorant persons who perform rites and duties. Such is this distinction made in the scripture Gita with regard to what is duty and what is not.
Objection: May it not be argued that it cannot be proved that all actions are due to ignorance?
Reply: No, (it can be proved,) as in the case of slaying a Brahmin. Although the nityakarmas are known from the scriptures, still they are meant only for the ignorant. As such an action as killing a Brahmin, even though known to be a source of evil from the scripture prohibiting it, is still perpetrated by one who has defects such as ignorance, passion, etc.-because impulsion to any action is otherwise not possible-, so also is it with regard to the nitya, naimittika and kamya actions.
Objection: May it not be held that impulsion to nityakarma etc. is not possible if the Self be not known as a distinct entity? [Unless one knows the Self to be distinct from the body etc. he will not perform the nityakarmas etc. meant for results in the other worlds, viz heaven etc.
(Tr.:) In place of vyatiriktatmani, Ast. reads 'deha-vyatiriktatmani, the Self which is distinct from the body'.]
Reply: No, since it is seen that with regard to actions which are of the nature of motion and are accomplished by the not-Self, one engages in them with the idea, 'I do.' [The actionless Self is not the agent of the movements of the body etc. Still agentship is superimposed on It through ignorance.]
Objection: Can it not be said that the notion of egoism with regard to the aggregate of body etc. occurs in a figurative sense; it is not false?
Reply: No, since its effects [i.e. the effects of the notion of egoism.] also will become figurative.
Objection: The notion of 'I' with regard to the aggregate of one's own body etc. occurs in a figurative sense. As with regard to one's own son it is said (in the Veda), 'It is you yourself who is called the son' (Sa. Br. 14.9.4.26), and in common parlance also it is said, 'This cow is my very life', so is the case here. [As the use of the word 'I' with regard to a son is figurative, so also with regard to the body.] This is certainly not a false notion. However, a false notion (of identity) occurs in the case of a stump and a man, when the distinction between them is not evident (due to darkness).
Reply: A figuratively expressed notion cannot lead to an effect in the real sense, because that (notion) is used for the eulogy of its basis with the help of a word of comparison which remains understood. As for instance, such sentences as, 'Devadatta is a lion', 'The boy is a fire'-implying 'like a lion', 'like a fire', on the basis of the similarity of cruelty, the tawny colour, etc.-are meant only for eulogizing Devadatta and the boy who are the basis (i.e. the subjects of the two sentences). But no action of a lion or a fire is accomplished because of the use of the figurative words or ideas. On the contrary, one experiences the evil effects of false notions. [Therefore the idea of 'I' with regard to one's body etc. does not occur in a secondary sense, but it does so falsely.] And with regard to the subjects of the figurative notions, one understands, 'This Devadatta cannot be a lion; this boy cannot be a fire.' Similarly, actions done by the aggregate of body etc., which is the 'Self' in a figurative sense, cannot be held to have been done by the Self which is the real subject of the notion of 'I'. For, actions done by the figurative lion or fire cannot be considered to have been accomplished by the real lion or fire. Nor is any action of the real lion and fire accomplished through the (figurative) cruelty or tawnyaness; for, their purpose is fully served by being used for eulogy. And those who are praised know, 'I am not a lion; I am not fire; and neither is the work of a lion or fire mine.' So the more ligical notion is, 'The action of the aggregate (of body etc.) do not belong to me who am the real Self', and not, 'I am the agent; it is my work.'
As for the assertion made by some that the Self acts through Its own memory, deisre and effort, which are the causes of activity-that is not so, for they are based on false knowledge. Memory, desire, effort, etc. indeed follow from the tendencies born from the experience of the desirable and the undesirable results of actions (-which actions themselves arise from the notions of the 'desirable' and the 'undesirable') caused by false knowledge. [False knowledge gives rise to the ideas of the desirable and the undesirable. From these arise desire and repulsion. Actions which follow give rise to the experience of their desirable and undesirable results. Such experiences create impressions in the mind, from which are born memory etc.] Just as in this life virtue, vice and the experience of their results are cuased by the identification (of the Self) with the aggregate of body etc. and attraction, repulsion, etc., so also was it in the previous birth, and even in the life preceding that. Thus it can be inferred that past and future mundane existence is without beginning and is a product of ignorance. And from this it becomes proved that the absolute cessation of mundane existence is caused by steadfastness in Knowledge, accompanied by renunciation of all rites and duties.
Besides, since self-identification with the body is nothing but ignorance, therefore, when the (ignorance) ceases, there remains so possibility of re-birth, and so, mundane existence becomes impossible. The identification of the Self with the aggregate of body etc. is nothing but ignorance, because in common life it is not seen that anybody who knows, 'I am different from cattle etc., and the cattle etc. are different from me', entertains the notion of 'I' with regard to them. However, mistaken perceiving a stump to be a man, one may out of indiscrimination entertain the idea of 'I' with regard to the aggregate of body etc.; not so when perceiving them as distinct. As for that notion of considering the son to be oneself-as mentioned in, 'It is you yourself who is called the son' (Sa. Br. 14.9.4.26)-, that is a metaphor based on the relationship between the begotten and the begetter. And no real action like eating etc.can be accomplished through something considered metaphorically as the Self, just as actions of the real lion or fire (cannot be accomplished) by someone metaphorically thought of to be a lion or fire.
Objection: Since an injunction relating to an unseen result is valid, therefore, may it not be said that the purposes of the Self are accomplished by the body and organs which are figuratively considered to be the Self?
Reply: No, since the thinking of them as the Self is the result of ignorance. The body, organs, etc. are not the Self in a figurative sense.
Objection: How then?
Reply: Although the Self is devoid of relationship, still, by an ascription of relationship (to the Self), they (body etc.) come to be regarded as the Self, verily through a false notion. For, this identification (of body etc.) with the Self exists so long as the false notion is there, and ceases to exist when it is not there. So long as ignorance lasts, identification of the Self with the aggregate of body and organs is seen only in the case of non-discriminating, immature, ignorant poeple who say, 'I am tall', 'I am fair'. But in the case of discriminating persons who possess the knowledge, 'I am different from the aggregate of body etc.', there does not arise the idea of egoism with regard to the body etc. at that time (i.e. simultaneously with that knowledge). Hence, since it (i.e. identification of the Self with the body etc.) ceases in the absence of the false notion, therefore it is a creation of that (false notion), and not a figurative notion.
It is only when the common and the uncommon features of the lion and Devadatta, or of fire and the boy, are known distinctly, that a figurative notion or verbal expression can occur; not when the common and the uncommon features are unknown.
As for the argument that (the figurative notion should be accepted) on the authority of the Vedas, we say, 'No', because their validity concerns unseen results. The validity of the Vedas holds good only with regard to matters concerning the relation between ends and means of Agnihotra etc., which are not known through such valid means of knowledge as direct perception; but not with regard to objects of direct perception etc., because the validity of the Vedas lies in revealing what is beyond direct perception. Therefore it is not possible to imagine that the idea of egism with regard to the aggregate of body etc., arising from an obviously of false knowledge, is a figurative notion. Surely, even a hundred Vedic texts cannot become valid if they assert that fire is cold or non-luminous! Should a Vedic text say that fire is cold or non-luminous, even then one has to assume that the intended meaning of the text is different, for otherwise (its) validity cannot be maintained; but one should not assume its meaning in a way that might contradict some other valid means of knowledge or contradict its own statement.
Objection: May it not be said that since actions are undertaken by one possessed of a false idea of agentship, therefore, when the agent ceases to be so ['According to you (the Vedantin), an ignorant man alone can be an agent. Therefore, when he becomes illumined, he will cease to be ignorant and conseently the Vedas will cease to be valid for him.'] the Vedas will become invalid?
Reply: No, since the Vedas become logically meaningful in respect of knowledge of Brahman. [Though the Vedic injunctions about rituals etc. be inapplicable in the case of an enlightened person, still they have empirical validity before enlightenment. Besides, the Vedas have real validity with regard to the knowledge of Brahman.]
Objection: May it not be said that there arises the contingency of the Vedic texts enjoining knowledge of Brahman becoming as invalid as those texts enjoining rites and duties?
Reply: No, since there cannot possibly be any notion which can remove (the knowledge of Brahman). Unlike the manner in which the idea of egoism with regard to the aggregate of body etc. is removed after the realization of the Self from hearing the Vedic injunctions regarding the knowledge of Brahman, the realization of the Self in the Self can never be removed in any way in that manner by anything whatsoever-just as the knowledge that fire is hot and luminous is irremovable-, since (Self-) realization is inseparable from its result (i.e. cessation of ignorance).
Besides, the Vedic texts enjoining rites (and duties) etc. are not invalid, because they, through the generation of successively newer tendencies by eliminating the successively preceding tendencies, are meant for creating the tendency to turn towards the indwelling Self. [The Vedic injunctions make people up rituals etc. by giving up their earlier worldly tendencies. Thery their minds become purified. The purified mind then aspires to know the indwelling Self. Thus, since the ritualistic injunctions are meant for making a person turn towards the knowledge ofthe indwelling Self, they are not invalid.] Although the means be unreal (in itself), still it may be meaningful in relation to the truth of the purpose it serves, as are the eulogistic sentences (arthavada) [See note on p. 40.-Tr.] occuring along with injunctions. Even in the world, when it becomes necessary to make to child or a lunatic drink milk etc. it is said that it will help growth of hair [Cuda, lit. hair on the top of the head; or single lock of hair left on the crown of the head after tonsure. See V.S.A.] etc.! Before the dawn of Knowledge, the (ritualistic) Vedic texts concerned with a different situation [The situation obtaining before the dawn of Self-knowledge.] are also as valid in themselves as are direct perception etc. occuring due to Self-identification with the body etc. On the other hand, as for your view 'The Self, though inactive by Itself, acts through Its mere proximity; and that itself constitutes agentship of the Self in the primary sense. Just as it is well known that a king, though not himself engaged in a battle, is, merely by virtue of his being in charge, said to be fighting when his soldiers are fighting, and that he is victorious or defeated; similarly, as the ?nder of an army acts through his mere orders, and it is seen that the results of the actions accrue to the king or to the ?nder; or, just as the actions of the priests are ascribed to the sacrificer,-in that very manner are the actions done by the body etc. ought to be of the Self because the result of those actions accrues to the Self. And, as the agentship of a magnet which, in fact, is not active, is attributed to it in the primary sense because it causes a piece of iron to move, similar is the agentship of the Self'-that is wrong, since it will amunt to an inactive entity becoming an agent.
Objection: May not agentship be of various kinds? 
Reply: No, for in the case of the 'king' and others it is seen that they have agentship even in the primary sense. As for the king, he fights even through his personal engagement. And he has agentship in the primary sense by virtue of making (his) warriors fight, distributing wealth, and also reaping the fruits of victory or defeat. Similarly, the agentship of a sacrificer is primary by virtue of his offering the main oblation and giving gifts due to the priests. Therefore it is understood that the agentship which is attributed to an inactive entity is figurative.
If primary agentship consisting in their personal engagement is not perceived in the case of the king, a sacrificer and others, then it could be assumed that they have primary agentship owing to the mere fact of their presence, just as a magnet has by virtue of making the iron move. But in the case of the king and others it is not perceived that they have no personal engagement in that way. Therefore, even the agentship owing to mere presence is a figurative one. And if that be so, the connection with the result of such agentship will also be figurative. No action in the primary sense is performed by an agent figuratively thought to be so. Hence the assertion is certainly wrong that owing to the activities of the body etc. the actionless Self becomes an agent and experiencer. But everything becomes possible due to error. This is just as it happens in dream or in jugglery!
Besides, in deep sleep, absorption in Brahman, etc. where the current of the mistaken idea of Self-identity with the body etc. ceases, evils like agentship, enjoyership, etc. are not perceived. Therefore this delusion of mundane existence is surely due to false knowledge; but it is not reality. Conseently, it is established that it ceases absolutely as a result of full enlightenment.
Having summed up in this chapter the import of the whole of the scripture Gita, and having again summarized it specially here at the end (in verse 66) for the sake of emphasizing the purport of the Scripture, now after that, the Lord states the rules for handing down the Scripture:
18.67 This is never to be spoken by thee to one who is devoid of austerities or devotion, nor to one who does not render service or who does not desire to listen, nor to one who cavils at Me.
18.67 Speak not this to one who has not practised austerities, or to him who does not love, or who will not listen, or who mocks.
18.67. This  [knowledge] is for you,  and it should never be imparted to one who does not observe austerities; to him who has no  devotion; to him who has no desire to listen; and to him who is indignant towards Me.
18.67 Never should this be told by you to one who is not austere, who is not a devotee, nor to one who has no wish to listen, nor certainly to him who traduces Me.
18.67 This (that I have taught) you should not ever be taught to one who is devoid of austerities and to one who is not a devotee; also, neither to one who does not render service, nor as well to one who cavils at Me.
18.67 I have taught you this most secret doctrine. This should not be imparted by you to someone who has not practised austere disciplines. Never should this be taught to someone who is not devoted to Me and to you, the teacher (i.e., when you have to play the role of a teacher of this doctrine). The meaning is that it should not be taught by you to someone who, though practising austerities, is not a devotee and does not serve Me. It is also never to be taught to one who has no wish to listen, even though he is a devotee. Nor should it be imparted to one who traduces Me, that is, who - when My nature, glories and attributes are described - discovers defects in them. The differences of case (from ablative to nominative form) is to teach that the last one is the most despicable character.
18.67 Idam etc.  If the secrecy of this knowledge is maintained it would yield success, because It is out of reach of all [ordinary]  persons.  When the knot of sin is cut off through observing  austerities, then only the results of good act is ready to become ripe.  Hence, austerity comes first.  Due to austerity, faith is born.  The same (faith) is devotion here.  The faith, even if it is born, does not grow well, in case it becomes visible only for a moment  and then perishes like lightning.  Therefore to help its growth, the desire to listen to is [next].  In the case of certain person, even all this arises with regard to the useless knowledge of the dry Sankhya (reasoning) system that admits no Supreme Lord.  Even with regard to a system  that adimts the Supreme Lord, it may, n the case of  another person-on account of his craving for fruit of action-emerge by raising the fruit-of-action alone to the status of importance and by humbling down one's own Worshipful Self to the role of an instrument in achieving that fruit It has been declared :
 
'The agent also [is an auxiliary], because he is for the action [enjoined].'					(JS, III, i, 6);
and  
'Actions also [are auxiliary] because they are for the purpose of fruits.'						(JS, III, i, 4).
 
Thus in both the instances there is indignation, meaning  'disregard' with the Bhagavat (Self) - This is the purport.
18.67 Idam, this Scripture; which has been taught by Me te, to you, for your good, for terminating mundane existence; an vacyam, should not be taught (-na is connected with the remote word vacyam-); atapaskaya, to one who is devoid of austerities. It should kadacana, never, under any condition whatsoever; be taught abhaktaya, to one who is not a devotee, who is devoid of devotion to his teacher and God, even if he be a man of austerity. Neither should it be taught even asurusave, to one who does not redner service-even though he may be a devotee and a man of austerity. Na ca, nor as well; to him yah, who; abhyasuyati, cavils; mam, at Me, at Vasudeva-thinking that I am an ordinary person; to him who, not knowing My Godhood, imputes self-adulation etc. to Me and cannot tolerate Me. He too is unfit; to him also it should not be imparted.
From the force of the context it is understood that the Scripture should be taught to one who has devotion to the Lord, is austere, renders service, and does not cavil. As to that, since it is seen (in a Smrti)-'to one who is intelligent or to one who is austere'-that there is an option between the two, it follows that this should be imparted either to an austere person given to service and devotion, or to an intelligent person endowed with them. It should not be imparted to an austere or even an intelligent person if he lacks service and devotion. It should not be taught to one who cavils at the Lord, even though he be possessed of all the good alities. And it should be taught to one whoserves his teacher and is devout. This is the rule for transmitting the Scripture.
Now the Lord states the fruit derived by one who transmits the Scripture:
18.68 He who with supreme devotion to Me will teach this supreme secret to My devotees, shall doubtlessly come to Me.
18.68 But he who teaches this great secret to My devotees, his is the highest devotion, and verily he shall come unto Me.
18.68. Whosoever shall declare this highest  secret to My devotees, he, cultivating an utmost devotion towards Me, and not entertaining any doubt, shall reach Me.
18.68 He who proclaims among My devotees this supreme mystery, shall come to Me, aciring supreme devotion towards Me. There is no doubt about this.
18.68 He who, entertaining supreme devotion to Me, will speak of this highest secret, to My devotees will without doubt reach Me alone.
18.68 Whose expounds or elucidates this supreme mystery to My devotees, he, aciring supreme devotion towards Me, will reach Me only. There is no doubt about this.
18.68 See Comment under 18.72
18.68 Yah, he who; abhi-dhasyati, will speak of, i.e., will present with the help of the text and its meaning, as I have done to you; imam, this; paramam, highest-that which has Liberation as its purpose; guhyam, secret, as spoken of above-(i.e.) the text in the form of a conversation between Kesava and Arjuna; madbhaktesu, to My devotees-. How will present? This is being stated: Krtva, entertaining; param, supreme; bhaktim, devotion; mayi, to Me, i.e., entertainting an idea thus-'A service is being rendered by me to the Lord who is the supreme Teacher'-. Tho him comes this result: esyati, he will reach; mam, Me; eva, alone. He is certainly freed. No doubt should be entertained in this regard.
By the repetition of (the word) bhakti (devotion) [In the word madbhaktesu.], it is understood that one becomes fit for being taught (this) Scripture by virtue of devotion alone to Him. 
Besides,
18.69 Nor is there any among men who does dearer service to Me, nor shall there be another on earth dearer to Me than he.
18.69 Nor is there among men any who can perform a service dearer to Me than this, or any man on earth more beloved by Me than he.
18.69. And, excepting him there would be none among men who is the best performer of what is dear to Me;  and other than him there shall be none else who is dearer to Me on earth.
18.69 Not among men is there any one who does dearer service to Me than he. Nor shall there be another on earth dearer to Me than he.
18.69 And as compared with him, none else among human beings is the best accomplisher of what is dear to Me. Moreover, nor will there be anyone else in the world dearer to Me than he.
18.69 There never exists nor has existed anyone other than such a person as described, who does greater service to Me than he. In the future too, there will not be another such. The first reference is to those who are not worthy to hear the Gita. It is meant to teach that explaining it to them is more displeasing to the Lord than not teaching to those who are worthy.
18.69 See Comment under 18.72
18.69 Ca, and; tasmat, as compared with him, with the one who hands down the Scripture; na kascit, none else; manusyesu, among human beings; is priya-krt-tamah, the best accomplisher of what is dear; me, to Me, i.e., among the present human beings, surely none else other than him exists who is a better accomplisher of what I cherish. Moreover, na bhavita, nor will there be in future; anyah, anyone else, a second person; bhuvi, in he world, here; priyatarah, dearer; tasmat, than him. [It may be argued that, since for a seeker of Liberation meditation is the best means for It, therefore he will have no inclination to transmit scriptural teachings. To this the Lord's answer is: One longing for Liberation has a duty to impart this scriptural teaching to one possessing the aforesaid alities.]
18.7 Verily the renunciation of obligatory action is not proper; the abandonment of the same from delusion is declared to be Tamasic.
18.7 It is not right to give up actions which are obligatory; and if they are misunderstood, it is the result of sheer ignorance.
18.7. The renunciation of the enjoined action does not stand to reason; and completely relinishing it, out of ignorance is proclaimed, on all sides, as an act of the Tamas (Strand).
18.7 But the renunciation of obligatory acts is not proper. Abandonment of these through delusion is declared to be Tamasika.
18.7 The abandoning of daily obligatory acts (nityakamas) is not justifiable. Giving up that through delusion is declared to be based on tamas.
18.7 Obligatory acts consist of daily, and occasional ceremonies like the five great sacrifices; their abandonment is not proper, for without actions even the sustenance of the body would be impossible, as already stated:  'From no-work, not even the body can be sustained' (3.8). The sustenance of the body by eating the sacrificial remnants produces perfect knowledge. Otherwise, as declared in the statement, 'But the sinful ones eat sin' (3.13). The satisfaction that comes by eating food which is not the remnant of sacrifice and which is therefore of the form of sin, is productive of erroneous knowledge in the mind. For, as declared in the Sruti, 'The mind consists of food' (Cha. U., 6.5.4), the mind is sustained by food. Also, there is the Sruti text, 'When the food is pure, the mind becomes pure; when the mind is pure, remembrance becomes firmly fixed; and when remembrance is acired, there is release from all knots of the heart' (Ibid., 7.26.2). It is therefore proved by the Sruti that knowledge of the form of direct perception of Brahman, is dependent on the purity of food. Hence the great sacrifices and such other obligatory and occasional rites are worthy of adoption till one's death, as they help in the knowledge of the Brahman. The renunciation of these is therefore not proper. Thus, the relinishment of these acts which produce knowledge through the delusion that they bind the self, is rooted in Tamas.

Tamasika renunciation has its roots in Tamas. Since such renunciation has its roots in ignorance which is the effect of Tamas, such renunciation is said to have its roots in Tamas. For Tamas is the root of ignorance as has been stated:  'From Tamas arise negligence and delusion, and also, ignorance' (14.17). Ignorance is erroneous knowledge which is antagonistic to right knowledge. So, it will be taught, 'That reason which, enveloped in Tamas, regards wrong as right, and which reverses every value, O Arjuna, is Tamasika' (18.32). It is for this reason that the renunciation of obligatory and occasional actions are said to have their roots in erroneous knowledge.

18.7 Therefore, sannyasah, the abandoning; niyatasya tu karmanah, of the daily obligatory acts, by the seeker of Liberation who is as yet unenlightened and is fit for rites and duites; na apapadyate, is not justifiable, because what is desired is the purification of unenlightened persons. Parityagah, giving up; tasya, of that, of the daily obligatory duty; mohat, through delusion, through ignorance; parikirtitah, is declared; to be tamasah, based on tamas.
Niyata is that duty which must be performed. That an act is niyata (obligatory) and it is relinished is contradictory. Therefore the giving up of that through delusion is declared to be based on tamas, for delusion is tamas.
Besides,
18.70 And he who will study this sacred dialogue of ours, by him I shall have been worshipped by the sacrifice of wisdom,  such is My conviction.
18.70 He who will study this spiritual discourse of ours, I assure thee, he shall thereby worship Me at the altar of Wisdom.
18.70. Whosoever would learn this sacred dialogue of both of us, by him I am worshipped (delighted) through the knowledge-sacrifice :  This is My opinion
18.70 And he who will study his dialogue of ours which is consistent with Dharma, by him I shall be worshipped through the sacrifice of knowledge; such is My view.
18.70 And he who will study this sacred conversation between us two, which is conducive to virtue, by him I shall be adored through the Sacrifice in the form of Knowledge. This is My judgement.
18.70 He who will study the dialogue between us, which is consistent with the path to realisation, by him I shall be worshipped through the sacrifice of knowledge. Such is My view. The meaning is that whateve sacrifice of knowledge is taught herein, by that I shall become worshipped by the mere fact of its study.

18.70 Ca, and; even he yah, who; adhyesyate, will study; imam, this; samvadam, conversation, the text in the form of a dialogue; between avayoh, us two; which is dharmyam, conducive to virtue, not divorced from virtue; tena, by him; this will be accomplished through that study; aham, I; syam, shall be; istah, adored; jnana-yajnena, through the Sacrifice in the form of Knowledge. Iti, this is me, My; matih, judgement. As compared with the various sacrifices, viz rituals, loud prayer, prayer uttered in a low voice and mental prayer, the Sacrifice in the from of Knowledge is the best [See 4.33.] because it is mental. Hence, the study of the scripture Gita is praised as that Sacrifice in the form of Knowledge. Or, this (verse) may merely be a judgement about the result. The idea is that the result of the study is comparable to the result of the Sacrifice in the form of the knowledge of gods and others.
Now, this is the reward for the hearer:
18.71 Also the man who hears this, full of faith and free from malice, he, too, liberated, shall attain to the happy worlds of those of righteous deeds.
18.71 Yea, he who listens to it with faith and without doubt, even he, freed from evil, shalt rise to the worlds which the virtuous attain through righteous deeds.
18.71. A man who would at least hear to [this] with faith and without indignation-he too, freed [from sins], will attain the auspicious worlds of men of meritorius acts.
18.71 And the man who listens to it with faith and without cavilling, he too shall be released, and shall reach the auspicious realms of those who have performed virtuous deeds.
18.71 Any man who, being reverential and free from cavilling, might even hear (this), he too, becoming free, shall attain the blessed worlds of those who perform virtuous deeds.
18.71 A man who, with faith and without cavilling, hears the Gita when faught by a alified teacher, he too is, by such hearing, released from all evil incompatible with devotional life. He shall reach the Lokas, i.e., the realms of the hosts of My devotees who have done virtuous acts, and who will facilitate the growth of devotion in these new arrivals and lead them ultimately to liberation.
18.71 See Comment under 18.72
18.71 Yah narah, any man who; being sraddhavan, reverential; and anasuyah, free from cavilling; srnuyat api, might even hear this text-the word even suggests that one who knows the meaning (of the Scripture) hardly needs to be mentioned-; sah api, he too; becoming muktah, free from sin; prapnuyat, shall attain; subhan, the blessed, auspicious; lokan, worlds; punya-karmanam, of those who perform virtuous deeds, of those who perform rites like Agnihotra etc.
In order to ascertaini whether or not the disciple has comprehended the meaning of the Scripture, the Lord asks (the following estion), the intention of the estioner beings, 'If it is known that it has not been comprehended, I shall again make him grasp it through other means.' Hery is shown the duty of the teacher that a student should be made to achieve his goal by taking the help of a different method.
18.72 Has this been heard, O Arjuna, with one-pointed mind? Has the delusion of thy ignorance been destroyed, O Dhananjaya?
18.72 O Arjuna! Hast thou listened attentively to My words? Has thy ignorance and thy delusion gone?
18.72. O son of Prtha !  Has this been heared by you with attentive mind ? O Dhananjaya !  Has your strong delusion, born of ignorance, been totally destroyed ?
18.72 Have you heard this, O Arjuna, with one-pointed mind?  Has your delusion, caused by ignorance, been dispelled?
18.72 O Partha, has this been listened to by you with a one-pointed mind? O Dhananjaya, has your delusion caused by ignorance been destroyed?
18.72 O Arjuna, have you heard attentively all that I have taught?  Has your delusion caused by ignorance, been dispelled - that ignorance deluded by which you said, 'I shall not fight'?
18.68-72 Ya idam etc. upto Dhananjaya. The very act of explaining this among My devotees is itself an act of cultivating devotion towards Me.  Whosoever shall declare etc :  Whosoever directs the mind [of the devotees] by face to face method, following the best procedure prescribed in the scriptures; i.e., he who shall impart  [this knowledge] - he becomes one with Me.  This is an injunction  [concerning the result]  and not a sentence of praise.  Likewise is  [the case] in other places also.
18.72 O Partha, kaccit etat, has this that has been said by Me; been srutam, listened to, grasped through hearing; ekagrena, with a none-pointed; cetasa, mind? Or have you been inattentive? O Dhananjaya, kaccit, has; te, your; ajnana-sammohah, delusion caused by ignorance, bewilderment, natural indiscrimination; been pranastah, destroyed, for which purpose has there been this effort on your part for hearing the Scripture, and on My part, the effort of being a teacher?
18.73 Arjuna said  Destroyed is my delusion as I have gained my knowledge (memory) through Thy grace, O Krishna. I remain freed from doubts. I will act according to Thy word.
18.73 Arjuna replied: My Lord! O Immutable One! My delusion has fled. By Thy Grace, O Changeless One, the light has dawned. My doubts are gone, and I stand before Thee ready to do Thy will."
18.73. Arjuna said  My delusion is destroyed; recollection is gained by me through your Grace, O Acyuta !  I stand firm, free of doubts;  I shall excute your ?nd.
18.73 Arjuna said  Destroyed is my delusion and I have, by your grace, O Krsna, gained knowledge (Smrti). Freed from doubts, I stand steadfast, I will fulfil Your world.
18.73 Arjuna said  O Acyuta, (my) delusion has been destroyed and memory has been regained by me through Your grace. I stand with my doubt removed; I shall follow Your instruction.
18.73 Arjuna said  'Delusion' or misapprehension is perverted knowledge. By Your grace it has been destroyed. 'Smrti' or memory is the knowledge of things as they really are. I have acired that. Misapprehension here is the misconception that the self is the Prakrti (body-mind) which is the non-self in reality. It consists in one not apprehending that all intelligent and non-intelligent entities, by reason of their forming the body of the Supreme Being, have Him as their Atman and are thus ensouled by Him. The misapprehension also consists in the lack of knowledge that actions, obligatory and occasional, do not cause bondage but actually form a means for the propitiation of the Supreme Being. All such misapprehensions are now destroyed.

The various phases of knowledge that cleared the misunderstanding may be catalogued as follows:  (1) The self is different from Prakrti and is therefore devoid of the alities of Prakrti. Its nature is that of the knower of Prakrti. (2) The self is a Sesa (sub-ordinate and servant) of the Supreme Person and is ruled by Him. The true knowledge about the Supreme Person is that He is what is signified by the expression Supreme Brahman. (3) He is the great ocean of all auspicious, excellent attributes such as knowledge, strength, glory, valour, power, brilliance etc., which are unbounded and natural. His essence consists solely of auspiciousness. He is antagonistic to all that is evil without exception. The origin, sustentation and dissolution of the entire universe are His sport. (4) You (Sri Krsna) are Vasudeva, the Supreme Person, known from the Vedanta, and who can be reached only by worship, which has taken the form of Bhakti. (5) Bhakti can be achieved by the control of the senses and the mind, the abandonment of prohibited acts and the performance of occasional and obligatory acts as solely intended for the goal of the satisfaction of the Supreme Person. Bhakti has to be developed day after day through the regular practice of the discriminatory knowledge of the higher and lower truths. All this has been attained by me (Arjuna).

Therefore I stand steadfast, freed from the doubts and devoid of the depression rooted in perverted knowledge nourished by compassion and love for relatives. Now I shall fulfil Your words, concerned with fighting etc., which ought to be done by me. I shall fight as instructed by You. Such is the meaning.

Sanjaya now relates to Dhrtarastra who had estioned him earlier as to what his sons and the Pandavas were doing in the battle:
18.73 Nastah etc.  By the passage  '[My] delusion is destroyed etc',  it is indicated that  [after hearing the Lord's instruction], only an inclination  to fight has risen in Arjuna, but the perfect realisation of the Brahman is not yet born in him.  While indicating so, [the sage Vyasa] provides a scope for the would-be subject matter for the Anugita.
18.73 O Acyuta, (my) mohah, born of ignorance and the cause of all evil in the form of mundane existence, and difficult to cross like an ocean;l nastah has been destroyed. And smrtih, memory, regarding the reality of the Self-on the acisition of which follows the loosening of all the bonds; labdha, has been regained, tvat-prasadat, through Your grace maya, by me, who am dependent on Your grace.
By this estion about the destruction of delusion and the answer to it, it becomes conclusively revealed that the fruit derived from understanding the import of the entire Scripture is this much alone-which is the destruction of delusion arising from ignorance and the regaining of the memory about the Self. And similarly, in the Upanisadic text beginning with 'I grieve because I am not a knower of the Self' (Ch. 7.1.3), it is shown that all bonds become destroyed when the Self is realized. There are also the words of the Upanisadic verses, 'The knot of the heart gets untied' (Mu. 2.2.8); 'at that time (or to that Self) what delusion and what sorrow can there be for that seer of oneness?' (Is.7).
Now then, sthitah, asmi, I stand under Your ?nd; gata-sandehah, with (my) doubts removed. Karisye, I shall follow; tava, Your; vacanam, instruction. By Your grace I have achieved the goal of life. The idea is, there is no duty, as such, for me.
The teaching of the Scripture is concluded. There-after, now in order to show the connection (of this) with the (main) narrative-.

18.78 Wherever is Krishna, the Lord of Yoga; wherever is Arjuna, the wielder of the bow; there are prosperity, victory, happiness and firm policy; such is my conviction.
18.78 Wherever is the Lord Shri Krishna, the Prince of Wisdom, and wherever is Arjuna, the Great Archer, I am more than convinced that good fortune, victory, happiness and righteousness will follow"
18.78. Where Krsna, the Lord of Yogins remains, where the son of Prtha holds his bow, there lie fortune, victory, prosperity and firm justice-so I believe.
18.78 Wherever there is Sri Krsna, the Lord of Yoga, and Arjuna the archer, there are ever fortune, victory, wealth and sound morality. This is my firm conviction.
18.78 Where there is Krsna, the Lord of yogas, and where there is Partha, the wielder of the bow, there are fortune, victory, prosperity and unfailing prudence. Such is my conviction.
18.78 Wherever there is Sri Krsna, the son of Vasudeva, the 'Yogesvara' who is the ruler of the various manifestations of Nature pertaining to all intelligent and non-intelligent entities that have high and low forms, and on whose volition depend the differences in the essential natures, existences and the activities of all things other than Himself, and wherever there is Arjuna, the archer, who is his paternal aunt's son and who took sole refuge at His feet - in such places there always will be present fortune, victory, wealth and sound morality. Such is my firm conviction.
18.74-78 Ityaham etc. upto matir mama While concluding the [Krsna-Arjuna]  dialogue with Sanjaya's speech, the [sage Vyasa] teaches this :  What leads to the Absolute Brahman is nothing but the recollection of the purport of the dialoguea recollection that is led finally to the status of the highly vivid, direct cognition admitting no differentiation  [between its subject and object],  resulting from the continuity helped by the series of incessant contemplations [on the purport of the dialogue] according to the method of firmly fixing.  Thus, only through the recollection of the dialogue of the Bhagavat and Arjuna, the Reality could be reached and due to that come fortunes, voctories and prosperity.
18.78 To be brief, yatra, where, the side on which; there is Krsna, yogeswarah, the Lord of yogas-who is the Lord of all the yogas and the source of all the yogas, since they originate from Him; and yatra, where, the side on which; there is Partha, dhanurdharah, the wielder of the bow, of the bow called Gandiva; tatra, there, on that side of the Pandavas; are srih, fortune; vijayah, victory; and there itself is bhutih, prosperity, great abundance of fortune; and dhruva, unfailing; nitih, prudence. Such is me, my ; matih, conviction.
18.8 He who abandons action on account of the fear of bodily trouble (because it is painful), does not obtain the merit of renunciation by doing such Rajasic renunciation.
18.8 To avoid an action through fear of physical suffering, because it is likely to be painful, is to act from passion, and the benefit of renunciation will not follow.
18.8. He who would, out of fear of bodily exertion, relinish an action, just because it is painful-that person, having [thus] made relinishment, an act of the Rajas (Strand), would not at all gain the fruit of [that] relinishment.
18.8 He who renounces acts as painful from fear of bodily suffering, performs a Rajasika abandonment; he does not gain the fruit of abandonment.
18.8 Whatever action one may relinish merely as being painful, from fear of physical suffering, he, having resorted to renunciation based on rajas, will surely not acire the fruits of renunciation.
18.8 Although actions constitute the indirect menas for release, yet they produce mental depression, since they can be done only by collecting materials involving painful effort and since they cause bodily strain on account of their reiring strenuous exertion. If, on account of such fear, one decides that the practice of knowledge alone should be tried for perfection in Yoga, and abandons actions like the great sacrifices applicable to one's station in life, he practises renunciation rooted in Rajas. Since that is not the meaning of the Sastras, one cannot win the fruit of renunciation in the form of the rise of knowledge. So it will be shown further one:  'That reason by which one erroneously knows, O Arjuna, is Rajasika' (18.31). In fact, actions do not directly cause purity of the mind but indirectly by winning the grace of God.
18.8 See Comment under 18.11
18.8 Yat, whatever; karma, action; tyajet, one may relinish, eva, merely; iti, as being; kuhkham, painful; [As being impossible to accomplish.] kaya-klesa-bhayat, from fear of physical suffering, out of fear of bodily pain; sah, he; krtva, having resorted; tyagam, to renunciation; rajasam, based on rajas, arising from rajas; will eva, surely; na labhet (shuld rather be labhate), not acire; tyaga-phalam, fruits of renunciation, the result called Liberation, which follows from renunciation of all actions as a conseence of Illumination.
Which, again, is the renunciation based on sattva?
18.9 Whatever obligatory action is done, O Arjuna, merely because it ought to be done, abandoning attachment and also the desire for reward, that renunciation is regarded as Sattvic (pure).
18.9 He who performs an obligatory action, because he believes it to be a duty which ought to be done, without any personal desire to do the act or to receive any return - such renunciation is Pure.
18.9. 'This is a thing to be performed.'-just on that ground whatever usual action is performed relinishing attachment and also fruit-that act of relinishment is deemed to be of the Sattva (Strand).
18.9 When actions are performed as what ought to be done, O Arjuna, renouncing attachment and also fruits, such abandonment is regarded as Sattvika.
18.9 Whatever obligatory duty is performed just because it is a bounden duty, O Arjuna, by giving up attachment and the result as well,-that renunciation is considered to be based on sattva.
18.9 When rites like obligatory and occasional ceremonies and the great sacrifices enjoined on one's station and stage in life, are practised for their own sake, as worship of Myself and as a duty, relinishing possessiveness and fruits - such abandonment is regarded as Sattvika. It is noted in Sattva. The idea is that it is rooted in the knowledge of the meaning of the Sastras as it really is. That Sattva generates the knowledge of things as they really are, has been taught in:  'From Sattva arises knowledge' (14.17), and it will be further declared:  'That reason by which one knows action and renunciation, what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, fear and fearlessness, bondage and release, O Arjuna, is Sattvika' (18.30).
18.9 See Comment under 18.11
18.9 Yat, whatever; niyatam karma, daily obligatory duty; kriyate, is performed, accomplished; iti eva, just because; it is karyam, a bounden duty; O Arjuna, tyaktva, by giving up; sangam, attachment; and phalam, the result; ca eva, as well; sah, that; tyagah, renunciation, giving up of attachment and (hankering for) the resutls of daily obligatory duties; matah, is considered; to be sattvikah, based on sattva, arising from sattva.
We said that the Lord's utterance is proof of the fruitfulness of daily obligatory duties. Or, even if the niyakarmas be understood (from the Lord's worlds) to be fruitless, still the ignorant man does certainly imagine that the nityakarmas (daily obligatory duites) when performed produce for oneself a result either in the form of purification of the mind or avoidance of evil. As to this, the Lord aborts even that imagination by saying, 'by giving up the result'. Hence it has been well said, 'by giving up attachment and the result'.
Objection: Well, is not the threefold relinishment of actions, also called sannyasa, under discussion? As regards this, the renunciation based on tamas and rajas have been stated. Why is the relinishment of attachment and (desire for their) results spoken of here as the third? This is like somody saying, 'Three Brahmanas have come. Of them two are versed in the six auxiliaries [The six auxiliaries are: Siksa (Phonetics), Kalpa (Code of Rituals and Sacrifices), Vyakarana (Grammar), Nirukta (Etymology), Chandas (Meter, Prosody), and Jyotisa (Astronomy).-Tr.] of the Vedas; the third is a Ksatirya!'
Reply: This is not wrong, for this is meant as a eulogy on the basis of the common factor of renunciation. Between renunciation of actions and renunciation. of hankering for results, there is, indeed, the similarity of the fact of renunciation. While on this subject, by condemning 'renunciation of actions' on account of its being based on rajas and tamas, the 'renunciation of desire for results of actions' is being praised on account of its being based on sattva, by saying, 'that renunciation is considered to be based on sattva.'
The internal organ of a person who is alified for rites and duties, who performs the nityakarmas by giving up attachment and hankering for results, becomes pure on account of its being untainted by attachment to results etc. and refined by the nitya-karmas. When it is pure and tranil, it becomes capable of contemplating on the Self. Since, for that very person whose internal organ has become purified by performing the nityakarmas and who has become ready for the knowledge of the Self, the process by which he can become steadfast in it has to be stated, therefore the Lord says:
2.1 Sanjaya said  To him who was thus overcome with pity and who was despondent, with eyes full of tears and agitated, Madhusudana (the destroyer of Madhu) or Krishna spoke these words.
2.1 Sanjaya then told how the Lord Shri Krishna, seeing Arjuna overwhelmed with compassion, his eyes dimmed with flowing tears and full of despondency, consoled him:
2.1. Sanjaya said  To him (Arjuna) who was thus possessed by compassion, whose eyes were confused and filled with tears and who was sinking in despondency, Madhusudana told this [following] sentence.
2.1 Sanjaya said   To him, who was thus overcome with pity, whose eyes were wet with tears, who was sorrow-stricken and who bore a bewildered look Sri Krsna spoke as follows:
2.1  Sanjaya said  To him who had been thus filled with pity, whose eyes were filled with tears and showed distress, and who was sorrowing, Madhusudana uttered these words:
2.1 - 2.3 Sanjaya said - Lord said  When Arjuna thus sat, the Lord, opposing his action, said:  'What is the reason for your misplaced grief?  Arise for battle, abandoning this grief, which has arisen in a critical situation, which can come only in men of wrong understanding, which is an obstacle for reaching heaven, which does not confer fame on you, which is very mean, and which is caused by faint-heartedness.
2.1 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
2.10 To him who was despondent in the midst of the two armies, Krishna, as if smiling, O Bharata, spoke these words.
2.10 Thereupon the Lord, with a gracious smile, addressed him who was so much depressed in the midst of the two armies.
2.10. O descendant of Bharata  (O Dhrtarastra) !  Hrsikesa,  as if  [he was]  smiling, spoke to him who was sinking in despondency in between two armies.
2.10 O King, to him who was thus sorrowing between the two armies, Sri Krsna spoke the following words, as if smiling (by way of ridicule).
2.10 O descendant of Bharata, to him who was sorrowing between the two armies, Hrsikesa, mocking as it were, said these words:
2.9 - 2.10 Sanjaya said  Thus, the Lord, the Supreme Person, introduced the Sastra regarding the self for the sake of Arjuna - whose natural courage was lost due to love and compassion in a misplaced situation, who thought war to be unrighteous even though it was the highest duty for warriors (Ksatriyas), and who took refuge in Sri Krsna to know what his right duty was -, thinking that Arjuna's delusion would not come to an end except by the knowledge of the real nature of the self, and that war was an ordained duty here which, when freed from attachment to fruits, is a means for self-knowledge. Thus,  has it been said by Sri Yamunacarya: 'The introduction to the Sastra was begun for the sake of Arjuna, whose mind was agitated by misplaced love and compassion and by the delusion that righteousness was unrighteousness, and who took refuge in Sri Krsna.'


The Supreme Person spoke these words as if smiling, and looking at Arjuna, who was thus overcome by grief resulting from ignorance about the real nature of the body and the self, but was nevertheless speaking about duty as if he had an understanding that the self is distinct from the body, and while he (Arjuna), torn between contradictory ideas, had suddenly become inactive standing between the two armies that were getting ready to fight. Sri Krsna said, as if in ridicule, to Arjuna the words beginning with, 'There never was a time when I did not exist' (II. 12), and ending with 'I will release you from all sins; grieve not!' (XVIII. 66) - which have for their contents the real nature of the self, of the Supreme Self, and of the paths of work (Karma), knowledge (Jnana) and devotion (Bhakti) which constitute the means for attaining the highest spiritual fulfilment.
2.7-10 Karpanya-etc. upto vacah. By the portion  'in between the two armies' etc., [the Sage] indicates this : Beings possessed by doubt, Arjuna had not abstained from the war totally;  for, he says thus : 'Please teach me, who am taking refuge in you'.  Therefore while he still remains just in between both knowledge and ignorance, he is taught by the glorious Bhagavat.
2.10 And here, the text commencing from 'But seeing the army of the Pandavas' (1.2) and ending with '(he) verily became silent, telling Him (Govinda), "I shall not fight"' is to be explained as revealing the cause of the origin of the defect in the from of sorrow, delusion, etc. [Delusion means want of discrimination. Etc. stands for the secondary manifestations of sorrow and delusion, as also ignorance which is the root cause of all these.] which are the sources of the cycles of births and deaths of creatures.
Thus indeed, Ajuna's own sorrow and delusion, cuased by the ideas of affection, parting, etc., originating from the erroneous belief, 'I belong to these; they belong to me', with regard to kingdom [See note under verse 8.-Tr.], elders, sons, comrades, well-wishers (1.26), kinsmen (1.37), relatives (1.34) and friends, have been shown by him with the words, 'How can I (fight)৷৷.in battle (against) Bhisma' (4), etc. It is verily because his discriminating insight was overwhelmed by sorrow and delusion that, even though he had become engaged in battle out of his own accord as a duty of the Ksatriyas, he desisted from that war and chose to undertake other's duties like living on alms etc. It is thus that in the case of all creatures whose minds come under the sway of the defects of sorrow, delusion, etc. there verily follows, as a matter of course, abandoning their own duties and resorting to prohibited ones. Even when they engage in their own duties their actions with speech, mind, body, etc., are certainly motivated by hankering for rewards, and are accompanied by egoism. [Egoism consists in thinking that one is the agent of some work and the enjoyer of its reward.]
Such being the case, the cycle of births and deaths  characterized by passing through desireable and undesirable births, and meeting with happiness, sorrow, etc. [From virtuous deeds follow attainment of heaven and happiness. From unvirtuous, sinful deeds follow births as beasts and other lowly beings, and sorrow. From the performance of both virtuous and sinful deeds follows birth as a human being, with a mixture of happiness and sorrow.] from the accumulation of virtue and vice, continues unendingly. Thus, sorrow and delusion are therefore the sources of the cycles of births and deaths. And their cessation comes from nothing other than the knowledge of the Self which is preceded by the renunciation of all duties. Hence, wishing to impart that (knowledge of the Self) for favouring the whole world, Lord Vasudeva, making Arjuna the medium, said, 'You grieve for those who are not to be grieved for,' etc.
As to that some (opponents) [According to A.G. the opponent is the Vrttikara who, in the opinion of A. Mahadeva Sastri, is none other than Bodhayana referred to in Sankaracarya's commentary on B.S. 1.1.11-19.-Tr.] say: Certainly, Liberation cannot be attained merely from continuance in the knowledge of the Self which is preceded by renunciation of all duties and is independent of any other factor. What then? The well-ascertained conclusion of the whole of the Gita is that Liberation is attained through Knowledge associated with rites and duties like Agnihotra etc. prescribed in the Vedas and the Smrtis. And as an indication of this point of view they ote (the verses): 'On the other hand, if you will not fight this righteous (battle)' (33); 'Your right is for action (rites and duties) alone' (47); 'Therefore you undertake action (rites and duties) itself' (4.15), etc. Even this objection should not be raised that Vedic rites and duties lead to sin since they involve injury etc.'.
Objection: How?
Opponent: The duties of the Ksatriyas, charaterized by war, do not lead to sin when undertaken as one's duty, even though they are extremely cruel since they involve violence against elders, brothers, sons and others. And from the Lord's declaration that when they are not performed, 'then, forsaking your own duty and fame, you will incur sin' (33), it stands out as (His) clearly stated foregone conclusion that one's own duties prescribed in such texts as, '(One shall perform Agnihotra) as long as one lives' etc., and actions which involve crutely to animals etc. are not sinful.
Vedantin: That is wrong because of the assertion of the distinction between firm adherence (nistha) to Knowledge and to action, which are based on two (different) convictions (buddhi).
The nature of the Self, the supreme Reality, determined by the Lord in the text beginning with 'Those who are not to be grieved for' (11) and running to the end of the verse, 'Even considering your own duty' (31), is called Sankhya. Sankhya-buddhi [Sankhya is that correct (samyak) knowledge of the Vedas which reveals (khyayate) the reality of the Self, the supreme Goal. The Reality under discussion, which is related to this sankhya by way of having been revealed by it, is Sankhya.] (Conviction about the Reality) is the conviction with regard to That (supreme Reality) arising from the ascertainment of the meaning of the context [Ascertainment৷৷.of the context, i.e., of the meaning of the verses starting from, 'Never is this One born, and never does It die,' etc. (20).]  that the Self is not an agent because of the absence in It of the six kinds of changes, viz birth etc. [Birth, continuance, growth, transformation, decay and death.] Sankhyas are those men of Knowledge to whom that (conviction) becomes natural. Prior to the rise of this Conviction (Sankhya-buddhi), the ascertained [Ast. and A.G. omit this word 'ascertainment, nirupana'-Tr.] of the performance of the disciplines leading to Liberation  which is based on a discrimination between virtue and vice, [And adoration of God]. and which presupposes the Self's difference from the body etc. and Its agentship and enjoyership  is called Yoga. The conviction with regard to that (Yoga) is Yoga-buddhi. The performers of rites and duties, for whom this (conviction) is appropriate, are called yogis.
Accordingly, the two distinct Convictions have been pointed out by the Lord in the verse, 'This wisdom (buddhi) has been imparted to you from the standpoint of Self-realization (Sankhya). But listen to this (wisdom) from the standpoint of (Karma-) yoga' (39). And of these two, the Lord will separately speak, with reference to the Sankhyas, of the firm adherence to the Yoga of Knowledge. [Here Yoga and Knowledge are identical. Yoga is that through which one gets connected, identified. with Brahman.] which is based on Sankya-buddhi, in, 'Two kinds of adherences were spoken of by Me in the form of the Vedas, in the days of yore.' [This portion is ascending to G1.Pr. and A.A.; Ast. omits this and otes exactly the first line of 3.3. By saying, 'in the form of the Vedas', the Lord indicates that the Vedas, which are really the knowledge inherent in God and issue out of Him, are identical with Himself.-Tr.] similarly, in, 'through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' (3.3), He will separately speak of the firm adherence to the Yoga [Here also Karma and Yoga are identical, and lead to Liberation by bringing about purity of heart which is followed by steadfastness in Knowledge.] of Karma which is based on Yoga-buddhi (Conviction about Yoga). Thus, the two kinds of steadfastness  that based on the conviction about the nature of the Self, and that based on the conviction about rites and duties  have been distinctly spoken of by the Lord Himself, who saw that the coexistence of Knowledge and rites and duties is not possible in the same person, they being based on the convictions of non-agentship and agentship, unity and diversity (respectively).
As is this teaching about the distinction (of the two adherences), just so has it been revealed in the Satapatha Brahmana: 'Desiring this world (the Self) alone monks and Brahmanas renounce their homes' (cf. Br. 4.4.22). After thus enjoining renunciation of all rites and duties, it is said in continuation, 'What shall we acheive through childeren, we who have attained this Self, this world (result).' [The earlier otation implies an injuction (vidhi) for renunciation, and the second is an arthavada, or an emphasis on that injunction. Arthavada: A sentence which usually recommends a vidhi, or precept, by stating the good arising from its proper observance, and the evils arising from its omission; and also by adducing historical instances in its support.-V.S.A] Again, there itself it is said that, before accepting a wife a man is in his natural state [The state of ignorance owing to non-realization of Reality. Such a person is a Brahmacarin, who goes to a teacher for studying the Vedas]. And (then) after his eniries into rites and duties, [The Brahmacarin first studies the Vedas and then enires into their meaning. Leaving his teacher's house after completing his course, he becomes a house holder.] 'he' for the attainment of the three worlds [This world, the world of manes and heaven.-Tr.] 'desired' (see Br. 1.4.17) as their means a son and the two kinds of wealth consists of rites and duties that lead to the world of manes, and the divine wealth of acisition of vidya (meditation) which leads to heaven. In this way it is shown that rites and duties enjoined by the Vedas etc. are meant only for one who is unenlightened and is passessed of desire. And in the text, 'After renouncing they take to mendicancy' (see Br. 4.4.22), the injunction to renounce is only for one who desires the world that is the Self, and who is devoid of hankering (for anything else).
Now, if the intention of the Lord were the combination of Knowledge with Vedic rites and duties, then this utterance (of the Lord) (3.3) about the distinction would have been illogical. Nor would Arjuna's estion, 'If it be Your opinion that wisdom (Knowledge) is superior to action (rites and duties)৷৷.,' etc. (3.1) be proper. If the Lord had not spoken earlier of the impossibility of the pursuit of Knowledge and rites and duties by the same person (at the same time), then how could Arjuna falsely impute to the Lord  by saying, 'If it be your opinion that wisdom is superior to action৷৷৷৷'  (of having spoken) what was not heard by him, viz the higher status of Knolwedge over rites and duties? Morevoer, if it be that the combination of Knowledge with rites and duties was spoken of for all, then it stands enjoined, ipso facto, on Arjuna as well. Therefore, if instruction had been given for practising both, then how could the estion about 'either of the two' arise as in, 'Tell me for certain one of these (action and renunciation) by which I may attain the highest Good' (3.2)? Indeed, when a physician tells a patient who has come for a cure of his biliousness that he should take things which are sweet and soothing, there can arise no such reest as, 'Tell me which one of these two is to be taken as a means to cure biliousness'! Again, if it be imagined that Arjuna put the estion because of his noncomprehension of the distinct meaning of what the Lord had said, even then the Lord ought to have answered in accordance with the estion: 'The combination of Knowledge with rites and duties was spoken of by Me. Why are you confused thus?' On the other hand, it was not proper to have answered, 'Two kinds of steadfastness were spoken of by Me it the days of yore,' in a way that was inconsistent and at variance with the estion.
Nor even do all the statements about distinction etc. become logical if it were intended that Knowledge was to be combined with rites and duties enjoined by the Smrtis only. Besides, the accusation in the sentence, 'Why then do you urge me to horrible action' (3.1) becomes illogical on the part of Arjuna who knew that fighting was a Ksatriya's natural duty enjoined by the Smrtis. Therefore, it is not possible for anyone to show that in the scripture called the Gita there is any combination, even in the least, of Knowledge of the Self with rites and duties enjoined by the Srutis or the Smrtis. But in the case of a man who had engaged himself in rites and duties because of ignorance and defects like the attachment, and then got his mind purified through sacrifices, charities or austerities (see Br. 4.4.22), there arises the knowledge about the supreme Reality  that all this is but One, and Brahman is not an agent (of any action). With regard to him, although there is a cessation of rites and duties as also of the need for them, yet, what may, appear as his diligent continuance, just as before, in those rites and duties for setting an example before people  that is no action in which case it could have stood combined with Knowledge. Just as the actions of Lord Vasudeva, in the form of performance of the duty of a Ksatriya, do not get combined with Knowledge for the sake of achieving the human goal (Liberation), similar is the case with the man of Knowledge because of the absence of hankering for results and agentship. Indeed, a man who has realized the Truth does not thingk 'I am doing (this)' nor does he hanker after its result.
Again, as for instance, person hankering after such desirable things as heaven etc. may light up a fire for performing such rites as Agnihotra etc. which are the mans to attain desirable things; [The Ast. reading is: Agnihotradi-karma-laksana-dharma-anusthanaya, for the performance of duties in the form of acts like Agnihotra etc.-Tr.] then, while he is still engaged in the performance of Agnihotra etc. as the means for the desirable things, the desire may get destroyed when the rite is half-done. He may nevertheless continue the performance of those very Agnihotra etc.; but those performance of those very Agnihotra etc.; but those Agnihotra etc. cannot be held to be for this personal gain.
 Accordingly does the Lord also show in various places that, 'even while perfroming actions,' he does not act, 'he does not become tainted' (5.7). As for the texts, '৷৷.as was performed earlier by the ancient ones' (4.15), 'For Janaka and others strove to attain Liberation through action itself' (3.20), they are to be understood analytically.
Objection: How so?
Vedantin: As to that, if Janaka and others of old remained engaged in activity even though they were knowers of Reality, they did so for preventing people from going astray, while remaining established in realization verily through the knowledge that 'the organs rest (act) on the objects of the organs' (3.28). The idea is this that, though the occasion for renunciation of activity did arise, they remained established in realization along with actions; they did not give up their rites and duties.
On the other hand, if they were not knowers of Reality, then the explanation should be this; Through the discipline of dedicating rites and duties to God, Janaka and others remained established in perfection (samsiddhi) either in the form of purification of mind or rise of Knowledge. This very idea [The idea that rites and duties become the cause of Knowledge through the purification of the mind.] will be expressed by the Lord in, '(the yogis) undertake action for the purification of oneself (i.e. of the heart, or the mind)' (5.11). After having said, 'A human being achieves success by adoring Him through his own duties' [By performing one's own duty as enjoined by scriptures and dedicating their results to God, one's mind becomes purified. Then, through Gods grace one becomes fit for steadfastness in Knowledge. From that steadfatness follows Liberation. Therefore rites and duites do not directly lead to Liberation. (See Common. under 5.12) (18.46), He will again speak of the steadfastness in Knowledge of a person who has attained success, in the text, '(Understand৷৷.from Me৷৷.that process by which) one who has achieved success attains Brahman' (18.50).
So, the definite conclusion in the Gita is that Liberation is attained only from the knowledge of Reality, and not from its combination with action. And by pointing out in the relevant contexts the (aforesaid) distinction, we shall show how this conclusion stands.
That being so, Lord Vasudeva found that for Arjuna, whose mind was thus confused about what ought to be done [The ast. and A.A., have an additional word  mithyajnanavatah, meaning 'who had false ignorance'.-Tr.] and who was sunk in a great ocean of sorrow, there could be no rescue other than through the knowledge of the Self. And desiring to rescue Arjuna from that, He said, '(You grieve for) those who are not to be grieved for,' etc. by way of introducing the knowledge of the Self. [In this Gita there are three distinct parts, each part consisting of six chapters. These three parts deal with the three words of the great Upanisadic saying, 'Tattvamasi, thou art That', with a view to finding out their real meanings. The first six chapters are concerned with the word tvam (thou); the following six chapters determine the meaning of the word tat (that); and the last six reveal the essential identity of tvam and tat. The disciplines necessary for realization this identity are stated in the relevant places.]
2.11 The Blessed Lord said  Thou hast grieved for those that should not be grieved for, yet thou speakest words of wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead.
2.11 Lord Shri Krishna said: Why grieve for those for whom no grief is due, and yet profess wisdom? The wise grieve neither for the dead nor the living.
2.11. While lamenting for those who cannot be lamented on and those who do not reire to be lamented on,  you do not talk like a wise man !  The learned do not lament for those of departed life and those of non-departed life.
2.11 The  Lord said  You grieve for those who should not be grieved for; yet you speak words of wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the dead nor for the living.
2.11 The Blessed Lord said  You grieve for whose who are not to be grieved for; and you speak words of wisdom! The learned do not grieve for the departed and those who have not departed.
2.11 The Lord said  You are grieving for those who do not deserve to be grieved for. You also speak words of wisdom about the nature of the body and the self as follows:  'The ancestors fall degraded, deprived of the ritual oblations of food and water' (I. 42). There is no reason for such grief for those who possess the knowledge of the nature of the body and the self. Those who know the exact truth will not grieve for those bodies from which life has departed and for those from whome the principle of life has not departed. They do not grieve for bodies or souls.

Hence, in you this contradiction is visible - your grief at the thought 'I shall slay them?'  and at the same time your talk about righteousness and unrighteousness, as if it were the result of knowledge of the self as distinct from the body. Therefore you do not know the nature of the body nor of the self which is distinct from the body and is eternal. Nor do you know of duties like war etc., which (as duty) constitute the means for the attainment of the self, nor of the fact that this war (which forms a duty in the present context), if fought without any selfish desire for results, is a means for the attainment of the knowledge of the true nature of the self.

The implied meaning is this:  This self, verily, is not dependent on the body for Its existence, nor is It subjected to destruction on the death of the body, as there is no birth or death for It. Therefore there is no cause for grief. But the body is insentient by nature, is subject to change, and its birth and death are natural; thus it (body) too is not to be grieved for.

First listen about the nature of the self.
2.11 Asocyan etc.  You lament for the body that cannot be lamented over, because it is of incessantly perishing nature; and also for the Soul that does not reire to be lamented.  No one, either of departed life, i.e., the dead, or of non-departed life, i.e.,  the living, is to be mourned for.  As for instance, the Soul is ever non-perishing.   What sort of lamentability can be for It,  as It is plessantly travelling in different bodies ?  Nor is it right to say that Its lamentability is due only to Its travel in another body.  For, in that case,  It should be lamented for, even when the stage of youth etc., is attained. 
 In this manner, the two ideas [the Lord] relates :
2.11 Bhisma, Drona and others are not to be grieved for, because they are of noble character and are eternal in their real nature. With regard to them, asocyan, who are not to be grieved for; tvam, you; anvasocah, grieve, (thinking) 'They die because of me; without them what shall I do with dominion and enjoyment?'; ca, and; bhasase, you speak; prajnavadan, words of wisdom, words used by men of wisdom, of intelligence. The idea is, 'Like one mad, you show in yourself this foolishness and learning which are contradictory.'
Because, panditah, the learned, the knowers of the Self  panda means wisdon about the Self; those indeed who have this are panditah, one the authority of the Upanisadic text, '৷৷.the knowers of Brahman, having known all about scholarship,৷৷.' (Br. 3.5.1) ['Therefore the knowers of Brahman, having known all about scholorship, should try to live upon that strength which comes of Knowledge; having known all about this strength as well as scholorship, he becomes meditative; having known all about both meditativeness and its opposite, he becomes a knower of Brahman.']  ; na anusocanti, do not grieve for; gatasun, the departed, whose life has become extinct; agatasun ca, and for those who have not departed, whose life has not left, the living. The ideas is, 'Your are sorrowing for those who are eternal in the real sense, and who are not to be grieved for. Hence your are a fool!.'
2.12 Nor at any time indeed was I not, nor thou, nor these rulers of men, nor verily shall we ever cease to be hereafter.
2.12 There was never a time when I was not, nor thou, nor these princes were not; there will never be a time when we shall cease to be.
2.12. Never indeed at any time [in the past] did I not exist,  nor you,  nor these kings; and never shall we all not exist hereafter.
2.12 There never was a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor any of these kings of men. Nor will there be any time in future when all of us shall cease to be.
2.12 But certainly (it is) not (a fact) that I did not exist at any time; nor you, nor these rulers of men. And surely it is not that we all shall cease to exist after this.
2.12 Indeed, I, the Lord of all, who is eternal, was never non-existent, but existed always. It is not that these selves like you, who are subject to My Lordship, did not exist; you have always existed. It is not that 'all of us', I and you, shall cease to be 'in the future', i.e., beyond the present time; we shall always exist. Even as no doubt can be entertainted that I, the Supreme Self and Lord of all, am eternal, likewise, you (Arjuna and all others) who are embodied selves, also should be considered eternal.

The foregoing implies that the difference between the Lord, the sovereign over all, and the individual selves, as also the differences among the individual selves themselves, are real. This has been declared by the Lord Himself. For, different terms like 'I', 'you', 'these', 'all' and 'we' have been used by the Lord while explaining the truth of eternality in order to remove the misunderstanding of Arjuna who is deluded by ignorance.

[Now follows a refutation of the Upadhi theory of Bhaskara and the Ignorance theory of the Advaitins which deny any ultimate difference between the Lord and the Jivas.]

If we examine (Bhaskara's) theory of Upadhis (adjuncts), which states that the apparent differences among Jivas are due to adjuncts, it will have to be admitted that mention about differences is out of place when explaining the ultimate truth, because the theory holds that there are no such differences in reality. But that the differences mentioned by the Lord are natural, is taught by the Sruti also:  'Eternal among eternals, sentient among sentients, the one, who fulfils the desires of the many' (Sve. U. VI. 13, Ka. U. V. 13).

The meaning of the text is:  Among the eternal sentient beings who are countless, He, who is the Supreme Spirit, fulfils the desires of all.'

As regards the theory of the Advaitins that the perception of difference is brought about by ignorance only and is not really real, the Supreme Being - whose vision must be true and who, therefore must have an immediate cognition of the differencelss and immutable and eternal consciousness as constituting the nature of the Atman in all authenticity, and who must thery be always free from all ignorance and its effects - cannot possibly perceive the so-called difference arising from ignornace. It is, therefore, unimaginable that He engages himself in activities such as teaching, which can proceed only from such a perception of differences arising from ignorance.

The argument that the Supreme Being, though possessed of the understanding of nom-duality, can still have the awareness of such difference persisting even after sublation, just as a piece of cloth may have been burnt up and yet continues to have the appearance of cloth, and that such a continuance of the subltated does not cause bondage - such an argument is invalid in the light of another analogy of a similar kind, namely, the perception of the mirage, which, when understood to be what it is, does not make one endeavour to fetch water therefrom. In the same way even if the impression of difference negated by the non-dualistic illumination persists, it cannot impel one to activities such as teaching; for the object to whom the instruction is to be imparted is discovered to be unreal. The idea is that just as the discovery of the non-existence of water in a mirage stops all effort to get water from it, so also when all duality is sublated by illumination, no activity like teaching disciples etc., can take place.

Nor can the Lord be conceived as having been previously ignorant and as attaining knowledge of unity through the scirptures, and as still being subject to the continuation of the stultified experiences. Such a position would stand in contradiction to the Sruti and the Smrti:  'He, who is all-comprehender' (Mun. U., 1. 1. 9); all knower and supreme and natural power of varied types are spoken of in Srutis, such as knowledge, strength and action' (Sve. U. 6. 8); 'I know, Arjuna, all beings of the past, present and future but no one knows Me,' etc. (Gita 7. 26).

And again, if the perception of difference and distinction are said to persist even after the unitary Self has been decisively understood, the estion will arise - to whom will the Lord and the succession of teachers of the tradition impart the knowledge in accordance with their understanding?  The estion needs an answer. The idea is that knowledge of non-duality and perception of differences cannot co-exist. If it be replied by Advaitins holding the Bimba-Pratibimba (the original and reflections) theory that teachers give instructions to their own reflections in the form of disciples such as Arjuna, it would amount to an absurdity.

For, no one who is not out of his senses would undertake to give any instruction to his own reflections in mediums such as a precious stone, the blade of a sword or a mirror, knowing, as he does, that they are non-different from himself. The theory of the persistence of the sublated is thus impossible to maintain, as the knowledge of the unitary self destroys the beginningless ignorance in which differences falling outside the self are supposed to be rooted. 'The persistence of the sublated' does occur in cases such as the vision of the two moons, where the cause of the vision is the result of some real defect in eyesight, nor removable by the right understanding of the singleness of the moon. Even though the perception of the two moons may continue, the sublated cognition is rendered inconseential on the strength of strong contrary evidence. For, it will not lead to any activity appropriate for a real experience.

But in the present context (i.e. the Advaitic), the conception of difference, whose object and cause are admittedly unreal, is cancelled by the knowledge of reality. So the 'persistence of the sublated' can in no way happen. Thus, if the Supreme Lord and the present succession of preceptors have attained the understanding of (Non-dual) reality, their perception of difference and work such as teaching proceeding from that perception, are impossible. If, on the other hand, the perception of difference persists because of the continuance of ignorance and its cause, then these teachers are themselves ignorant of the truth, and they will be incapable of teaching the truth.

Further, as the preceptor has attained the knowledge of the unitary self and thery the ignorance concerning Brahman and all the effects of such ignorance are thus annihilated, there is no purpose in instructing the disciple. It it is held that the preceptor and his knowledge are just in the imagination of the disciple, the disciple and his knowledge are similarly the product of the imagination of the preceptor, and as such can not put an end to the ignorance in estion. If it is maintained that the disciple's knowledge destroys ignorance etc., because it contradicts the antecedent state of non-enlightenment, the same can be asserted of the preceptor's knowledge. The futility of such teachings is obvious. Enough of these unsound doctrines which have all been refuted.
2.12 See Comment under 2.13
2.12 Why are they not to be grieved for? Because they are eternal. How? Na tu eva, but certainly it is not (a fact); that jatu, at any time; aham, I ; na asam, did not exist; on the contrary, I did exist. The idea is that when the bodies were born or died in the past, I existed eternally. [Here Ast. adds ghatadisu viyadiva, like Space in pot etc.-Tr.] Similarly, na tvam, nor is it that you did not exist; but you surely existed. Ca, and so also; na ime, nor is it that these ; jana-adhipah, rulers of men, did not exist. On the other hand, they did exist. And similarly, na eva, it is surely not that; vayam, we; sarve, all; na bhavisyamah, shall cease to exist; atah param, after this, even after the destruction of this body. On the contrary, we shall exist. The meaning is that even in all the three times (past, present and future) we are eternal in our nature as the Self. The plural number (in we) is used following the diversity of the bodies, but not in the sense of the multiplicity of the Self.
2.13 Just as in this body the embodied (soul) passes into childhood, youth and old age, so also does it pass into another body; the firm man does not grieve thereat.
2.13 As the soul experiences in this body infancy, youth and old age, so finally it passes into another. The wise have no delusion about this.
2.13. Just as the boyhood,  youth and old age come to the embodied Soul in this body, in the same manner is the attaining of another body;  the wise man is not deluded at that.
2.13 Just as the self associated with a body passes through childhood, youth and old age (pertaining to that body), so too (at death) It passes into another body. A wise man is not deluded by that.
2.13 As are boyhood, youth and decrepitude to an embodied being in this (present) body, similar is the acisition of another body. This being so, an intelligent person does not get deluded.
2.13 As the self is eternal, one does not grieve, thinking that the self is lost, when an embodied self living in a body gives up the state of childhood and attains youth and other states. Similarly, the wise men, knowing that the self is eternal, do not grieve, when the self attains a body different from the present body. Hence the selves, being eternal, are not fit objects for grief.

This much has to be done here; the eternal selves because of Their being subject ot beginningless Karma become endowed with bodies suited to Their Karmas. To get rid of this bondage (of bodies), embodied beings perform duties like war appropriate to their stations in life with the help of the same bodies in an attitude of detachment from the fruits as prescribed by the scripture. Even to such aspirants, contacts with sense-objects give pleasure and pain, arising from cold, heat and such other things. But these experiences are to be endured till the acts enjoined in the scriptures come to an end.

The Lord explains the significance immediately afterwards:
2.12-13 Na hi etc. Dehinah etc Never indeed did I not exist, but I did exist [always].  Likewise are you and these kings.  If there can be lamentability for one, on attaining change in physical form then why is one not lamented over when one attains the youth from the boyhood ?  He, who is wise, does not lament.  But, wisdom is easily attainable for him whose concern is not even for this [present] body.  Therefore you must seek wisdom.
2.13 As to that, to show how the Self is eternal, the Lord cites an illustration by saying,'৷৷.of the embodied,' etc. Yatha, as are, the manner in which; kaumaram, boyhood; yauvanam, youth, middle age; and jara, decrepitude, advance of age; dehinah, to an embodied being, to one who possesses a body (deha), to the Self possessing a body; asmin, in this, present; dehe, body . These three states are mutually distinct. On these, when the first state gets destroyed the Self does not get destroyed; when the second state comes into being It is not born. What then? It is seen that the Self, which verily remains unchanged, acires the second and third states. Tatha, similar, indeed; is Its, the unchanging Self's dehantarapraptih, acisition of another body, a body different from the present one. This is the meaning. Tatra, this being so; dhirah, an intelligent person; na, does not; muhyati, get deluded.
2.14 The contacts of the senses with the objects, O son of Kunti, which cause heat and cold, pleasure and pain, have a beginning and an end; they are impermanent; endure them bravely, O Arjuna.
2.14 Those external relations which bring cold and heat, pain and happiness, they come and go; they are not permanent. Endure them bravely, O Prince!
2.14. O son of Kunti !  But the touches with the matras cause the [feelings of] cold and heat,  pleasure and pain; they are of the nature of coming and going and are transient.  Forbear them,  O Descendent of Bharata !
2.14 The contact of senses with their objects, O Arjuna, gives rise to feelings of cold and heat, pleasure and pain. They come and go, never lasing long. Endure them, O Arjuna.
2.14 But the contacts of the organs with the objects are the producers of cold and heat, happiness and sorrow. They have a beginning and an end, (and) are transient. Bear them, O descendant of Bharata.
2.14 As sound, touch, form, taste and smell with their bases, are the effects of subtle elements (Tanmatras), they are called Matras. The contact with these through the ear and other senses gives rise to feelings of pleasure and pain, in the form of heat and cold, softness and hardness. The words 'cold and heat' illustrate other sensations too. Endure these with courage till you have discharged your duties as prescribed by the scriptures. The brave must endure them patiently, as they 'come and go'. They are transient. When the Karmas, which cause bondage, are destroyed, this 'coming and going' will end.

The Lord now explains the purpose of this endurance:
2.14 Matra etc.  But the unwise lament even over those passing situations of cold and heat, pleasure and pain that are created by those touches i.e., the contacts of the sense-objects-referable with the term matra - with the Soul through the door of the sense-organs; but the wise do not do so.  Thus says [the Lord]. 
Or, the passage may be interpreted as :  The touches (contacts) of these objects are with the matras, i.e., with the sense-organs, and not directly with the Supreme Self,  Coming : birth.  Going : destruction, Those situations that have these two you must forbear i.e., put up with.
2.14 'In the case of a man who knows that the Self is eternal, although there is no possibility of delusion concerning the destruction of the Self, still delusion, as of ordinary people, caused by the experience of cold, heat, happiness and sorrow is noticed in him. Delusion arises from being deprived of happiness, and sorrow arises from contact with pain etc.' apprehending this kind of a talk from Arjuna, the Lord said, 'But the contacts of the organs,' etc.
Matra-sparsah, the contacts of the organs with objects; are sita-usna-sukha-duhkha-dah, producers of cold, heat, happiness and sorrow. Matrah means those by which are marked off (measured up) sounds etc., i.e. the organs of hearing etc. The sparsah, contacts, of the organs with sound etc. are matra-sparsah. Or, sparsah means those which are contacted, i.e. objects, viz sound etc. Matra-sparsah, the organs and objects, are the producers of cold, heat, happiness and sorrow.
Cold sometimes produces pleasure, and sometimes pain. Similarly the nature of heat, too, is unpredictable. On the other hand, happiness and sorrow have definite natures since they do not change. Hence they are mentioned separately from cold and heat. Since they, the organs, the contacts, etc., agamapayinah, have a beginning and an end, are by nature subject to origination and destruction; therefore, they are anityah, transient. Hence, titiksasva, bear; tan, them  cold, heart, etc., i.e. do not be happy or sorry with regard to them.
2.15 That firm man whom, surely, these afflict not, O chief among men, to whom pleasure and pain are the same, is fit for attaining immortality.
2.15 The hero whose soul is unmoved by circumstance, who accepts pleasure and pain with equanimity, only he is fit for immortality.
2.15. O the best among persons !  That wise person becomes immortal whom these (situations) do not trouble and to whom the pleasure and pain are eal.
2.15 For, he whom these do not affect, O chief of men, and to whom pain and pleasure are the same - that steadfast man alone is worthy of immortality.
2.15 O (Arjuna, who are) foremost among men, verily, the person whom these do not torment, the wise man to whom sorrow and happhiness are the same  he is fit for Immortality.
2.15 That person endowed with courage, who considers pain as inevitable as pleasure, and who performs war and such other acts suited to his station in life without attachment to the results and only as a means of attaining immortality - one whom the impact of weapons in war etc., which involve soft or harsh contacts, do not trouble, that person only attains immortality, not a person like you, who cannnot bear grief. As the selves are immortal, what is to be done here, is this much only. This is the meaning.

Because of the immortality of the selves and the natural destructibility of the bodies, there is no cause for grief. It was told (previously):  'The wise grieve neither for the dead nor for the living' (2. 11). Now the Lord elucidates the same view.
2.15 But, because all these different situations are of the nature of coming and going, on that account itself are they not to be lamented on ?  It is not so.  As for instance :  What is this which is termed  'coming' ?  If it is  'birth', what is that  'birth' itself ?  It is wrong to say that is the same as gaining the self by what is non-existent.  For, to be of the nature of non-existence, is indeed to be devoid of every inherent nature and to be devoid of the very self.  If a thing is devoid of the self and devoid of every nature, how is it possible to convert it into what has an intrinsic nature ?  Surely, it is impossible to  convert  the non-blue into blue.  For, it is faulty and undesirable to covert  the non-blue into blue. For, it is faulty and undesirable to conclude that a thing  with certain in nature changes to be of a different nature.  Hence the scritpure goes -
 'The intrinsic nature of beings would not cease to
exist, e.g., the heat of the sun'. 
 On the other hand, if the 'birth' signifies the gaining of self just by what [really] exists, even then, why the lamentability on its coming ?  For, what has gained a self, could never be non-existent and conseently it would be eternal.
 
Likewise, is the act of  'going' also meant for the existent or the non-existent ?  What is non-existent is just non-existent  [for ever.]  How can there be a non-existence-nature even in the case of  that which is of the existence-nature ?  If it is said that it is of the non-existence-nature in the second moment; [since its birth], then it should be so even in the first moment; and so nothing would be existent.  For, the intrinsic nature  [ever] remains unabandoned.
 
But is it not that the destruction of it  (i.e., of a given thing, like a pot) is brought about by the stroke of a hammer etc.?  Yet, if that destruction is altogether different [from the existent one i.e. the pot], then what does it matter for what is existent ?  But, it is not be seen  [at that time] ?  Yet, what is actually existent (pot) may not be seen just as when it is covered with a cloth; but it has not turned to be altogether different.  In fact, it has been said [in the scriptures] that this is not different  [from the existent].  Summarising all these, [the Lord] says -
2.15 What will happen to one who bears cold and heat? Listen: Verily, the person৷৷.,'etc.
(O Arjuna) hi, verily; yam purusam, the person whom; ete, these, cold and heat mentioned above; na, do not; vyathayanti, torment, do not perturb; dhiram, the wise man; sama-duhkha-sukham, to whom sorrow and happiness are the same, who is free from happiness and sorrow when subjected to pleasure and pain, because of his realization of the enternal Self; sah, he, who is established in the realization of the enternal Self, who forbears the opposites; kalpate, becomes fit; amrtattvaya, for Immortality, for the state of Immortality, i.e. for Liberation.
2.16 The unreal hath no being; there is non-being of the real; the truth about both has been seen by the knowers of the Truth (or the seers of the Essence).
2.16 That which is not, shall never be; that which is, shall never cease to be. To the wise, these truths are self-evident.
2.16. Birth (or existence) does not happen to what is non-existent,  and destruction (or non-existence) to what is existent;  the finality of  these two has been seen by the seers of the reality.
2.16 The unreal can never come into being, the real never ceases to be. The conclusion about these two is seen by the seers of truth.
2.16 Of the unreal there is no being; the real has no nonexistence. But the nature of both these, indeed, has been realized by the seers of Truth.
2.16 'The unreal,' that is, the body, can never come into being. 'The real,' that is, the self, can never cease to be. The finale about these, the body and the self, which can be experienced, has been realised correctly by the seers of the Truth. As analyis ends in conclusion, the term 'finale' is here used. The meaning is this:  Non-existence (i.e., perishableness) is the real nature of the body which is in itself insentient. Existence (i.e., imperishableness) is the real nature of the self, which is sentient. [What follows is the justification of describing the body as 'unreal' and as having 'never come into being.']

Non-existence has, indeed, the nature of perishableness, and existence has the nature of imperishableness, as Bhagavan Parasara has said:  'O Brahmana, apart from conscious entity there does not exist any group of things anywhere and at any time. Thus have I taught you what is real existence - how conscious entity is real, and all else is unreal' (V. P., 2.12.43 - 45). 'The Supreme Reality is considered as imperishable by the wise. There is no doubt that what can be obtained from a perishable substance is also perishable' (Ibid., 2.14.24). 'That entity which even by a change in time cannot come to possess a difference through modification etc., is real. What is that entity, O King?  (It is the self who retains Its knowledge)' (Ibid., 2.13.100).

It is said here also:  'These bodies ৷৷. are said to have an end' (2.18) and 'Know That (the Atman) to be indestructible' (2.17). It is seen from this that this (i.e., perishableness of the body and imperishableness of the self) is the reason for the designating the Atman as 'existence' (Sattva) and body as 'non-existence' (Asvattva). This verse has no reference to the doctrine of Satkaryavada (i.e., the theory that effects are present in the cause), as such a theory has no relevance here. Arjuna is deluded about the true nature of the body and the self; so what ought to be taught to him in order to remove his delusion, is discrimination between these two - what is alified by perishablenss and what, by imperishableness. This (declaration) is introduced in the following way:  'For the dead, or for the living' (2.11).

Again this poin is made clear immediately (by the words), 'Know that to be indestructible ৷৷.' (2.17) and 'These bodies ৷৷. are said to have an end' (2.18).

How the imperishableness of the self is to be understood, Sri Krsna now teaches:
2.16 Nasatah etc. And then, also following the common worldly practice [the Lord] says this :  There is no [real] existence for what is non-existent i.e., the body [etc.], that is continuously perishing; for it is changing incessantly by stages.  Again, never there is destruction for the ever existing Supreme Self, because of Its unchanging nature.  So says the Veda too :

   'Lo ! This Soul is of unchanging nature and [hence]
        is destructions' (the Br. U, IV, v. 14). 
 
Of  These two : of what is existent and what is non-existent.   Finality :  the point of  boundary  where they come to an end.	
 
 But is this permanent or transient which is perceived by persons who are prone to see the truth ?  Having raised this doubt,  [the Lord] says :
2.16 Since 'the unreal has no being,' etc., for this reason also it is proper to bear cold, heat, etc. without becoming sorrowful or deluded. Asatah, of the unreal, of cold, heat, etc. together with their causes; na vidyate, there is no; bhavah, being, existence, reality; because heat, cold, etc. together with their causes are not substantially real when tested by means of proof. For they are changeful, and whatever is changeful is inconstant. As configurations like pot etc. are unreal since they are not perceived to be different from earth when tested by the eyes, so also are all changeful things unreal because they are not perceived to be different from their (material) causes, and also because they are not perceived before (their) origination and after destruction.
Objection: If it be that [Here Ast. has the additional words 'karyasya ghatadeh, the effect, viz pot etc. (and)'.-Tr.] such (material) causes as earth etc. as also their causes are unreal since they are not perceived differently from their causes, in that case, may it not be urged that owing to the nonexistence of those (causes) there will arise the contingency of everything becoming unreal [An entity cannot be said to be unreal merely because it is non-different from its cause. Were it to be asserted as being unreal, then the cause also should be unreal, because there is no entity which is not subject to the law of cuase and effect.]?
Vedantin: No, for in all cases there is the experience of two awarenesses, viz the awareness of reality, and the awareness of unreality. [In all cases of perception two awarenesses are involved: one is invariable, and the other is variable. Since the variable is imagined on the invariable, therefore it is proved that there is something which is the substratum of all imagination, and which is neither a cause nor an effect.] That in relation to which the awareness does not change is real; that in relation to which it changes is unreal. Thus, since the distinction between the real and the unreal is dependent on awareness, therefore in all cases (of empirical experiences) everyone has two kinds of awarenesses with regard to the same substratum: (As for instance, the experiences) 'The pot is real', 'The cloth is real', 'The elephant is real'  (which experiences) are not like (that of) 'A blue lotus'. [In the empirical experience, 'A blue lotus', there are two awarenesses concerned with two entities, viz the substance (lotus) and the ality (blueness). In the case of the experience, 'The pot is real', etc. the awarenesses are not concerned with substratum and alities, but the awareness of pot,of cloth, etc. are superimposed on the awareness of 'reality', like that of 'water' in a mirage.] This is how it happens everywhere. [The coexistence of 'reality' and 'pot' etc. are valid only empirically  according to the non-dualists; whereas the coexistence of 'blueness' and 'lotus' is real according to the dualists.]
Of these two awareness, the awareness of pot etc. is inconstant; and thus has it been shown above. But the awareness of reality is not (inconstant). Therefore the object of the awareness of pot etc. is unreal because of inconstancy; but not so the object of the awareness of reality, because of its constancy.
Objection: If it be argued that, since the awareness of pot also changes when the pot is destroyed, therefore the awareness of the pot's reality is also changeful?
Vedantin: No, because in cloth etc. the awareness of reality is seen to persist. That awareness relates to the odjective (and not to the noun 'pot'). For this reason also it is not destroyed. [This last sentence has been cited in the f.n. of A.A.-Tr.]
Objection: If it be argued that like the awareness of reality, the awareness of a pot also persists in other pots?
Vedantin: No, because that (awareness of pot) is not present in (the awareness of) a cloth etc.
Objection: May it not be that even the awareness of reality is not present in relation to a pot that has been destroyed?
Vedantin: No, because the noun is absent (there). Since the awareness of reality corresponds to the adjective (i.e. it is used adjectivelly), therefore, when the noun is missing there is no possibility of its (that awareness) being an adjective. So, to what should it relate? But, again, the awareness of reality (does not cease) with the absence of an object৷৷ [Even when a pot is absent and the awareness of reality does not arise with regare to it, the awareness of reality persists in the region where the pot had existed. 
Some read nanu in place of na tu ('But, again'). In that case, the first portion (No,৷৷.since৷৷.adjective. So,৷৷.relate?) is a statement of the Vedantin, and the Objection starts from nanu punah sadbuddheh, etc. so, the next Objection will run thus: 'May it not be said that, when nouns like pot etc. are absent, the awareness of existence has no noun to alify, and therefore it becomes impossible for it (the awareness of existence) to exist in the same substratum?'-Tr.]
Objection: May it not be said that, when nouns like pot etc. are absent, (the awareness of existence has no noun to alify and therefore) it becomes impossible for it to exist in the same substratum? [The relationship of an adjective and a noun is seen between two real entities. Therefore, if the relationship between 'pot' and 'reality' be the same as between a noun and an adjective, then both of them will be real entities. So, the coexistence of reality with a non-pot does not stand to reason.]
Vedantin: No, because in such experiences as, 'This water exists', (which arises on seeing a mirage etc.) it is observed that there is a coexistence of two objects though one of them is non-existent.
Therefore, asatah, of the unreal, viz body etc. and the dualities (heat, cold, etc.), together with their causes; na vidyate, there is no; bhavah, being. And similarly, satah, of the real, of the Self; na vidyate, there is no; abhavah, nonexistence, because It is constant everywhere. This is what we have said.
Tu, but; antah, the nature, the conclusion (regarding the nature of the real and the unreal) that the Real is verily real, and the unreal is verily unreal; ubhayoh api, of both these indeed, of the Self and the non-Self, of the Real and the unreal, as explained above; drstah, has been realized thus; tattva-darsibhih, by the seers of Truth. Tat is a pronoun (Sarvanama, lit. name of all) which can be used with regard to all. And all is Brahman. And Its name is tat. The abstraction of tat is tattva, the true nature of Brahman. Those who are apt to realize this are tattva-darsinah, seers of Truth.
Therefore, you too, by adopting the vision of the men of realization and giving up sorrow and delusion, forbear the dualities, heat, cold, etc.  some of which are definite in their nature, and others inconstant , mentally being convinced that this (phenomenal world) is changeful, verily unreal and appears falsely like water in a mirage. This is the idea.
What, again, is that reality which remains verily as the Real and surely for ever? This is being answered in, 'But know That', etc.
2.17 Know that to be indestructible, by Which all this is pervaded. None can cause the destruction of That, the Imperishable.
2.17 The Spirit, which pervades all that we see, is imperishable. Nothing can destroy the Spirit.
2.17. And  know That to be destructionsless,  by Which all this (universe) is pervaded; no one is capable of causing destruction to this changeless One.
2.17 Know That to be indestructible by which all this is pervaded. None can cause the destruction of This Immutable.
2.17 But know That to be indestructible by which all this is pervaded. None can bring about the destruction of this Immutable.
2.17 Know that the self in its essential nature is imperishable. The whole of insentient matter, which is different (from the self), is pervaded by the self. Because of pervasiveness and extreme subtlety, the self cannot be destroyed; for every entity other than the self is capable of being pervaded by the self, and hence they are grosser than It. Destructive agents like weapons, water, wind, fire etc., pervade the substances to be destroyed and disintegrate them. Even hammers and such other instruments rouse wind through violent contact with the objects and thery destroy their objects. So, the essential nature of the self being subtler than anything else, It is imperishable.

(The Lord) now says that the bodies are perishable:
2.17 Avinasi etc  [Here]  tu is in the sense of ca 'and'.  So, 'and' the Soul is not of perishing nature.
2.17 Tu, but  this word is used for distinguishing (reality) from unreality; tat viddhi, know That; to be avinasi, indestructible, by nature not subject to destruction; what? (that) yena, by which, by which Brahman called Reality; sarvam, all; idam, this, the Universe together with space; is tatam, pervaded, as pot etc. are pervaded by space. Na kascit, none; arhati, can; kartum, bring about; vinasam, the destruction, disappearance, nonexistence; asya, of this avyayasya, of the Immutable, that which does not undergo growth and depletion. By Its very nature this Brahman called Reality does not suffer mutation, because, unlike bodies etc., It has no limbs; nor (does It suffer mutation) by (loss of something) belonging to It, because It has nothing that is Its own. Brahman surely does not suffer loss like Devadatta suffering from loss of wealth. Therefore no one can bring about the destruction of this immutable Brahman. No one, not even God Himself, can destroy his own Self, because the Self is Brahman. Besides, action with regard to one's Self is self-contradictory.
Which, again, is that 'unreal' that is said to change its own nature? This is being answered:
2.18 These bodies of the embodied Self, Which is eternal, indestructible and immeasurable, are said to have an end. Therefore fight, O Arjuna.
2.18 The material bodies which this Eternal, Indestructible, Immeasurable Spirit inhabits are all finite. Therefore fight, O Valiant Man!
2.18. These physical bodies that have an end and suffer the peculiar destruction,  are declared to belong to the eternal embodied Soul, Which is destructionless and imcomprehensible.  Therefore fight,  O descendent of Bharata !
2.18 These bodiesof the Jiva (the embodied self) are said to have an end while the Jiva itself is eternal, indestructible and incomprehensibel. Therefore, fight O Bharata (Arjuna).
2.18 These destructible bodies are said to belong to the everlasting, indestructible, indeterminable, embodied One. Therefore, O descendant of Bharata, join the battle.
2.18 The root 'dih' means 'to grow.' Hence these bodies (Dehas) are characterised by complexity. They have an end - their nature is perishablity. For, jugs and such other things which are characterised by complexity are seen to have an end. The bodies of the embodied self, which are made of conglomerated elements, serve the purpose of experiencing the effects of Karmas, as stated in Brh. U. IV. 4.5, 'Auspicious embodiments are got through good actions.' Such bodies perish when Karmas are exhausted. Further the self is imperishable. Why?  Because it is not measurable. Neither can It be conceived as the object of knowledge, but only as the subject (knower). It will be taught later on:  'He who knows It is called the knower of the Field by those who know this (13.1).

Besides, the self is not seen to be made up of many (elements). Because in the perception 'I am the knower' throughout the body, only something other than the body is understood as possessing an invariable form as the knower. Further, this knower cannot be dismembered and seen in different places as is the case with the body. Therefore the self is eternal, for (1) It is not a complex being of a single form; (2) It is the knowing subject; and (3) It pervades all. On the contrary, the body is perishable, because (1) it is complex; (2) it serves the purpose of experiencing the fruits of Karma by the embodied self; (3) it has a plurality of parts and (4) it can be pervaded. Therefore, as the body is by nature perishable and the self by nature is eternal, both are not objects fit for grief. Hence, bearing with courage the inevitable strike of weapons, sharp or hard, liable to be received by you and others, begin the action called war without being attached to the fruits but for the sake of attaining immortality.
2.18 Antavantah etc.  The bodies, at the time of their attaining the unobservable stage,  meet their apparent destruction.  This would be impossible if they do not suffer the peculiar destruction,  that it to say they undergo changes every moment.  For, it has been said-
 
'By observing the dilapidated condition of beings at their last moment, the loss of newness is very moment is inferred'
 
The same has been said by the Sage (Vyasa) also as-
 
'In every being, in every moment, there is mutual difference between its tiny parts that have different purposes.  But on account of its subtlity, it is not cleary comprehended (MB, Santi.,  Moksa. Ch. 308, verse 121).
 
[In theabove passage] having different purposes amounts to say 'because they perform different acts having their own respective special purposes.;
 
 Now, the bodies have thier end and are ever changing.  On the other hand, the Self is destructionless,  because It is incomprehensible.  Changing nature belongs only to the insentient thing which is comprehensible, but not to what is non-insentient and is exclusively consciousness in nature.  Because, it is not possible [for one]  to gain an altogether different nature.  Thus, the bodies meet permanently their end and hence they cannot be lamented for;  the Self ever remains without destruction (or without changing)  and hence need not be lamented for.  Thus a single  krtya-suffix  has been employed on both the senses simultaneously by the sage in the expression asocyan.
2.18 Ime, these; antavantah, destructible; dehah, bodies  as the idea of reality which continues with regard to water in a mirage, etc. gets eliminated when examined with the means of knowledge, and that is its end, so are these bodies and they have an end like bodies etc. in dream and magic ; uktah, are said, by discriminating people; to belong nityasya, to the everlasting; anasinah, the indestructible; aprameyasya, the indeterminable; sarirnah, embodied One, the Self. This is the meaning.
The two words 'everlasting' and 'indestructible' are not repetitive, because in common usage everlastingness and destructibility are of two kinds. As for instance, a body which is reduced to ashes and has disappeared is said to have been destoryed. (And) even while existing, when it becomes transfigured by being afflicted with diseases etc. it is said to be 'destroyed'. [Here the A.A. adds 'tatha dhana-nase-apyevam, similar is the case even with regard to loss of wealth.'-Tr.] That being so, by the two words 'everlasting' and 'indestructible' it is meant that It is not subject to both kinds of distruction. Otherwise, the everlastingness of the Self would be like that of the earth etc. Therefore, in order that this contingency may not arise, it is said, 'Of the everlasting, indestructible'.
Aprameyasya, of the indeterminable, means 'of that which cannot be determined by such means of knowledge as direct perception etc.'
Objection: Is it not that the Self is determined by the scriptures, and before that through direct perception etc.?
Vedantin: No, because the Self is self-evident. For, (only) when the Self stands predetermined as the knower, there is a search for a means of knolwedge by the knower. Indeed, it is not that without first determining oneself as, 'I am such', one takes up the task of determining an object of knowledge. For what is called the 'self' does not remain unknown to anyone. But the scripture is the final authority [when the Vedic text establishes Brahman as the innermost Self, all the distinctions such as knower, known and the means of knowledge become sublated. Thus it is reasonable that the Vedic text should be the final authority. Besides, its authority is derived from its being faultless in as much as it has not originated from any human being.]: By way of merely negating superimposition of alities that do not belong to the Self, it attains authoritativeness with regard to the Self, but not by virtue of making some unknown thing known. There is an Upanisadic text in support of this: '৷৷.the Brahman that is immediate and direct, the Self that is within all' (Br. 3.4.1).
Since the Self is thus eternal and unchanging, tasmat, therefore; yudhyasva, you join the battle, i.e. do not desist from the war. Here there is no injunction to take up war as a duty, because be (Arjuna), though he was determined for war, remains silent as a result of being overpowered by sorrow and delusion. Therefore, all that is being done by the Lord is the removal of the obstruction to his duty. 'Therefore, join the battle' is only an approval, not an injunction.
The scripture Gita is intended for eradicating sorrow, delusion, etc. which are the cases of the cycle of births and deaths; it is not intended to enjoin action. As evidences of this idea the Lord cites two Vedic verses: [Ka. 1.2.19-20. There are slight verbal differences.-Tr.]
2.19 He who takes the Self to be the slayer and he who thinks It is slain, neither of them ï1knowsï1. It slays not, nor is It slain.
2.19 He who thinks that the Spirit kills, and he who thinks of It as killed, are both ignorant. The Spirit kills not, nor is It killed.
2.19. Whosoever views This to be the slayer and whosoever believes  This to be the slain,  both these do not understand :  This does not slay,  nor is This slain.
2.19 He who deems It (the self) a slayer, and he who thinks of It as slain - both are ignorant. For, the self neither slays nor is slain.
2.19 He who thinks of this One as the killer, and he who thinks of this One as the killed  both of them do not know. This One does not kill, nor is It killed.
2.19 With regard to "This" viz., the self, whose nature has been described above, he who thinks of It as the slayer, i.e., as the cause of slaying, and he who thinks 'This' (self) as slain by some cause or other - both of them do not know. As this self is eternal for the reasons mentioned above, no possible cause of destruction can slay It and for the same reason, It cannot be slain. Though the root 'han' (to slay) has the self for its object, it signifies causing the separation of the body from the self and not destruction of the self. Scriptural texts like 'You shall not cause injury to beings' and 'The Brahmana shall not be killed'?  (K. Sm. 8.2) indicate unsanctioned actions, causing separation of the body from the self. [In the above otes, slaughter in an ethical sense is referred to, while the text refers to killing or separating the self from the body in a metaphsyical sense. This is made explicit in the following verse].
2.19 Ya enam etc.  Whosoever  veiws This i.e., the Self and the body,  to be the slayer and the slain, ignorance is in him.  That is why he is in bondage.		
 The same  [point the Lord] clarifies -
2.19 But the ideas that you have, 'Bhisma and others are neing killed by me in war; I am surely their killer'  this idea of yours is false. How? Yah, he who; vetti, thinks; of enam, this One, the embodied One under consideration; as hantaram, the killer, the agent of the act of killing; ca, and; yah, he who, the other who; manyate, thinks; of enam, this One; as hatam, the killed  (who thinks) 'When the body is killed, I am myself killed; I become the object of the act of killing'; ubhau tau, both of them; owing to non-discrimination, na, do not; vijanitah, know the Self which is the subject of the consciousness of 'I'. The meaning is: On the killing of the body, he who thinks of the Self ( the content of the consciousness of 'I' ) [The Ast. omits this phrase from the precedig sentence and includes it in this place. The A.A. has this phrase in both the places.-Tr.] as 'I am the killer', and he who thinks, 'I have been killed', both of them are ignorant of the nature of the Self. For, ayam, this Self; owing to Its changelessness, na hanti, does not kill, does not become the agent of the act of killing; na hanyate, nor is It killed, i.e. It does not become the object (of the act of killing).
The second verse is to show how the Self is changeless:
2.2 The Blessed Lord said  Whence is this perilous strait come upon thee, this dejection which is unworthy of you, disgraceful, and which will close the gates of heaven upon you, O Arjuna?
2.2 "The Lord said: My beloved friend! Why yield, just on the eve of battle, to this weakness which does no credit to those who call themselves Aryans, and only brings them infamy and bars against them the gates of heaven?
2.2. The Bhagavat said  O Arjuna !   At a critical moment,  whence did this sinful act come to you which is practised by men of ignoble (low) birth and which is leading to the hell and is inglorious ?
2.2 The Lord said  Whence comes on you this despondency, O Arjuna, in this crisis? It is unift for a noble person. It is disgraceful and it obstructs one's attainment of heaven.
2.2 The Blessed Lord said  O Arjuna, in this perilous place, whence has come to you this impurity entertained by unenlightened persons, which does not lead to heaven and which brings infamy?
2.1 - 2.3 Sanjaya said - Lord said  When Arjuna thus sat, the Lord, opposing his action, said:  'What is the reason for your misplaced grief?  Arise for battle, abandoning this grief, which has arisen in a critical situation, which can come only in men of wrong understanding, which is an obstacle for reaching heaven, which does not confer fame on you, which is very mean, and which is caused by faint-heartedness.
2.2 Kutah etc.  To commence with, the Bhagavat exhorts Arjuna just by following the worldly (common) practice; but, in due course, He will impart knowledge.  Hence He says 'practised by men of low birth'. 
 Uttering words of ruke such as  'unmanliness' etc., the Bhagavat causes  [Arjuna] to know that he misconceives demerit as meritorious :
2.20 It is not born, nor does It ever die; after having been, It again ceases not to be; unborn, eternal, changeless and ancient, It is not killed when the body is killed.
2.20 It was not born; It will never die, nor once having been, can It cease to be. Unborn, Eternal, Ever-enduring, yet Most Ancient, the Spirit dies not when the body is dead.
2.20. This is neither born; nor ever dies; nor, having not been at one time, will This come to be again.  This is unborn, destructionless,  eternal and ancient and is not slain [even]  when the body is slain.
2.20 It (the self) is never born; It never dies; having come into being once, It never ceases to be. Unborn, eternal, abiding and primeval, It is not slain when the body is slain.
2.20 Never is this One born, and never does It die; nor is it that having come to exist, It will again cease to be. This One is birthless, eternal, undecaying, ancient; It is not killed when the body is killed.
2.20 As the self is eternal for the reasons mentioned (above), and hence free from modifications, it is said that all the attributes of the insentient (body) like birth, death etc., never touch the self. In this connection, as the statement, 'It is never born, It never dies' is in the present tense, it should be understood that the birth and death which are experienced by all in all bodies, do not touch the self. The statement 'Having come into being once, It never ceases to be' means that this self, having emerged at the beginning of a Kalpa (one aeon of manifestation) will not cease to be at the end of the Kalpa (i.e., will emerge again at the beginning of the next Kalpa unless It is liberated). This is the meaning - that birth at the beginning of a Kalpa in bodies such as those of Brahman and others, and death at the end of a Kalpa as stated in the scriptures, do not touch the self. Hence, the selves in all bodies, are unborn, and therefore eternal. It is abiding, not connected, like matter, with invisible modifications taking place. It is primeval; the meaning is that It existed from time immemorial; It is even new i.e., It is capable of being experienced always as fresh. Therefore, when the body is slain the self is not slain.
2.20  Na jayate etc.  Having not been at one time, This etc. :  this Self will come to be, having not been at any time non-existent, but only having been  existent.  Therefore This is not born, This does not die too.  For, having been [at one time], This will never be non-existent [at another time];  but certainly This will be [always] existent.
2.20 Na kadacit, neverl; is ayam, this One; jayate, born i.e. the Self has no change in the form of being born  to which matter is subject ; va, and ( va is used in the sense of and); na mriyate, It never dies. By this is denied the final change in the form of destruction. The word (na) kadacit), never, is connected with the denial of all kinds of changes thus  never, is It born never does It die, and so on. Since ayam, this Self; bhutva, having come to exist, having experienced the process of origination; na, will not; bhuyah, again; abhavita, cease to be thereafter, therefore It does not die. For, in common parlance, that which ceases to exist after coming into being is said to die. From the use of the word va, nor, and na, it is understood that, unlike the body, this Self does not again come into existence after having been non-existent. Therefore It is not born. For, the words, 'It is born', are used with regard to something which comes into existence after having been non-existent. The Self is not like this. Therfore It is not born.
Since this is so, therefore It is ajah, birthless; and since It does not die, therefore It is nityah, eternal. Although all changes become negated by the denial of the first and the last kinds of changes, still changes occuring in the middle [For the six kinds of changes see note under verse 2.10.-Tr.] should be denied with their own respective terms by which they are implied. Therefore the text says sasvatah, undecaying,. so that all the changes, viz youth etc., which have not been mentioned may become negated. The change in the form of decay is denied by the word sasvata, that which lasts for ever. In Its own nature It does not decay because It is free from parts. And again, since it is without alities, there is no degeneration owing to the decay of any ality. Change in the form of growth, which is opposed to decay, is also denied by the word puranah, ancient. A thing that grows by the addition of some parts is said to increase and is also said to be new. But this Self was fresh even in the past due to Its partlessness. Thus It is puranah, i.e. It does not grow. So also, na hanyate, It is puranah, i.e. It does not grow. So also, na hanyate, It is not killed, It does not get transformed; even when sarire, the body; hanyamane, is killed, transformed. The verb 'to kill' has to be understood here in the sense of transformation, so that a tautology [This verse has already mentioned 'death' in the first line. If the verb han, to kill, is also taken in the sense of killing, then a tautology is unavoidable.-Tr.] may be avoided.
In this mantra the six kinds of transformations, the material changes seen in the world, are denied in the Self. The meaning of the sentence is that the Self is devoid of all kinds of changes. Since this is so, therefore 'both of them do not know'  this is how the present mantra is connected to the earlier mantra.
2.21 Whosoever knows It to be indestructible, eternal, unborn and inexhaustible, how can that man slay, O Arjuna, or cause to be slain?
2.21 He who knows the Spirit as Indestructible, Immortal, Unborn, Always-the-Same, how should he kill or cause to be killed?
2.21. Whosever realises This to be changeless, destructionless, unborn and immutable, how can that person be slain; how can he either slay [any one] ?  O son of Prtha !
2.21 He who knows this (self) to be indestructible, unborn, unchanging and hence eternal - how and whom, O Arjuna, does he cause to be killed, and whom he kill?
2.21 O Partha, he who knows this One as indestructible, eternal, birthless and undecaying, how and whom does that person kill, or whom does he cause to be killed! [This is not a estion but only an emphatic denial.-Tr.]
2.21 He who knows the self to be eternal, as It is indestructible, unborn and changeless - how can that person be said to cause the death of the self, be it of the self existing in the bodies of gods or animals or immovables?  Whom does he kill?  The meaning is - how can he destroy any one or cause anyone to slay?  How does he become an instrument for slaying?  The meaning is this:  the feeling of sorrow:  'I cause the slaying of these selves, I slay these,' has its basis solely in ignorance about the true nature of the self.

Let it be granted that what is done is only separation of the bodies from the eternal selves. Even then, when the bodies, which are instruments for the experience of agreeable pleasures, perish, there still exists reason for sorrow in their separation from the bodies. To this (Sri Krsna) replies:
2.21 Veda etc.  Whosoever, because of his realisation, under-stands this Self as 'This neither slays [any one].  nor is This slain [by any one] - how could there be any bondage for him ?
2.21 In the mantra, 'He who thinks of this One as the killer,' having declared that (the Self) does not become the agent or the object of the actof killing, and then in the mantra, 'Never is this One born,' etc., having stated the reasons for (Its) changelessness, the Lord sums up the purport of what was declared above: He who knows this One as indestructible, etc.
Yah, he who; veda, knows  yah is to be thus connected with Veda ; enam, this One, possessing the characteristics stated in the earlier mantra; as avinasinam, indestructible, devoid of the final change of state; nityam, eternal, devoid of transformation; ajam, birthless; and avyayam, undecaying; katham, how, in what way; (and kam, whom;) does sah, that man of realization; purusah, the person who is himself an authority [i.e. above all injunctions and prohibitions. See 18.16.17.-Tr.]; hanti, kill, undertake the act of killing; or how ghatayati, does he cause (others) to be killed, (how does he) instigate a killer! The intention is to deny both (the acts) by saying, 'In no way does he kill any one, nor does he cause anyone to be killed', because an interrogative sense is absurd (here). Since the implication of the reason [The reason for the denial of killing etc. is the changelessness of the Self, and this reason holds good with regard to all actions of the man of realization.-Tr.], viz the immutability of the Self, [The A.A. omits 'viz the immutability of the Self'.-Tr.] is common (with regard to all actions), therefore the negation of all kinds of actions in the case of a man of realization is what the Lord conveys as the only purport of this context. But the denial of (the act of) killing has been cited by way of an example.
Objection: By noticing what special reason for the impossibility of actions in the case of the man of realization does the Lord deny all actions (in his case) by saying, 'How can that person,' etc.?
Vedantin: Has not the immutability of the Self been already stated as the reason [Some readings omit this word.-Tr.] , the specific ground for the impossibility of all actions?
Objection: It is true that it has been stated; but that is not a specific ground, for the man of realization is different from the immutable Self. Indeed, may it not be argued that action does not become impossible for one who has known as unchanging stump of a tree?!
Vedantin: No, because of man of Knowledge is one with the Self. Enlightenment does not belong to the aggregate of body and senses. Therefore, as the last laternative, the knower is the Immutable and is the Self which is not a part of the aggregate. Thus, action being impossible for that man of Knowledge, the denial in, 'How can that person৷৷.,' etc. is reasonable. As on account of the lack of knowledge of the distinction between the Self and the modifications of the intellect, the Self, though verily immutable, is imagined through ignorance to be the perceiver of objects like sound etc. presented by the intellect etc., in this very way, the Self, which in reality is immutable, is said to be the 'knower' because of Its association with the knowledge of the distinction between the Self and non-Self, which (knowledge) is a modification of the intellect [By buddhi-vrtti, modification of the intellect, is meant the transformation of the internal organ into the form of an extension upto an object, along with its past impressions, the senses concerned, etc., like the extension of the light of a lamp illuminating an object. Consciousness reflected on this transformation and remaining indistinguishable from that transformation revealing the object, is called objective knowledge. Thery, due to ignorance, the Self is imagined to be the perceiver because of Its connection with the vrtti, modification. (-A.G.)
The process is elsewhere described as follows:
The vrtti goes out through the sense-organ concerned, like the flash of a torchlight, and along with it goes the reflection of Consciousness. Both of them envelop the object, a pot for instance. The vrtti destroys the ignorance about the pot; and the reflection of Consciousness, becoming unified with only that portion of it which has been delimited by the pot, reveals the pot.
In the case of knowledge of Brahman, it is admitted that the vrtti in the form, 'I am Brahman', does reach Brahman and destroys ignorance about Brahman, but it is not admitted that Brahman is revealed like a 'pot', for Brahman is self-effulgent.-Tr.] and is unreal by nature. From the statement that action is impossible for man of realization it is understood that the conclusion of the Lord is that, actions enjoined by the scriptures are prescribed for the unenlightened.
Objection: Is not elightenment too enjoined for the ignorant? For, the injunction about enlightenment to one who has already achieved realization is useless, like grinding something that has already been ground! This being so, the distinction that rites and duties are enjoined for the unenlightened, and not for the enlightened one, does not stand to reason.
Vedantin: No. There can reasonable be a distinction between the existence or nonexistence of a thing to be performed. As after the knowledge of the meaning of the injunction for rites like Agnihotra etc. their performance becomes bligatory on the unenlightened one who thinks, 'Agnihotra etc. has to be performed by collecting various accessories; I am the agent, and this is my duty',  unlike this, nothing remains later on to be performed as a duty after knowing the meaning of the injunction about the nature of the Self from such texts as, 'Never is this One born,' etc. But apart from the rise of knowledge regarding the unity of the Self, his non-agency, etc., in the form, 'I am not the agent, I am not the enjoyer', etc., no other idea arises. Thus, this distinction can be maintained.
Again, for anyone who knows himself as, 'I am the agent', there will necessarily arise the idea, 'This is my duty.' In relation to that he becomes eligible. In this way duties are (enjoined) [Ast. adds 'sambhavanti, become possible'.-Tr.] for him. And according to the text, 'both of them do not know' (19), he is an unenlightened man. And the text, 'How can that person,' etc. concerns the enlightened person distinguished above, becuase of the negation of action (in this text).
Therefore, the enlightened person distinguished above, who has realized the immutable Self, and the seeker of Liberation are alified only for renunciation of all rites and duties. Therefore, indeed, the Lord Narayana, making a distinction between the enlightened man of Knowledge and the unenlightened man of rites and duties, makes them take up the two kinds of adherences in the text, 'through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization; through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' (3.3).
Similarly also, Vyasa said to his son, 'Now, there are these two paths,' etc. ['Now, there are these two paths on which the Vedas are based. They are thought of as the dharma characterized by engagement in duties, and that by renunciation of them' (Mbh. Sa. 241.6).-Tr.] So also (there is a Vedic text meaning): 'The path of rites and duties, indeed, is the earlier, and renunciation comes after that.' [Ast. says that this is not a otation, but only gives the purport of Tai, Ar. 10.62.12.-Tr.] The Lord will show again and again this very division: 'The unenlightened man who is deluded by egoism thinks thus: "I am the doer"; but the one who is a knower of the facts (about the varieties of the gunas) thinks, "I do not act"' (cf. 3.27,28). So also there is the text, '(The embodied man of selfcontrol,) having given up all actions mentally, continues (happily in the town of nine gates)' (5.13) etc.
With regard to this some wiseacres say: In no person does arise the idea, 'I am the changeless, actionless Self, which is One and devoid of the six kinds of changes beginning with birth to which all things are subject', on the occurrence of which (idea alone) can renunciation of all actions be enjoined. That is not correct, because it will lead to the needlessness of such scriptural instructions as, 'Never is this One born,' etc. (20). They should be asked: As on the authority of scripural instructions there arises the knowledge of the existence of virtue and vice and the knowledge regarding an agent who gets associated with successive bodies, similarly, why should not there arise from the scriptures the knowledge of unchangeability, non-agentship, oneness, etc. of that very Self?
Objection: If it be said that this is due to Its being beyond the scope of any means (of knowledge)?
Vedantin: No, because the Sruti says, 'It is to be realized through the mind alone, (following the instruction of the teacher)' (Br. 4.4.19). The mind that is purified by the instructions of the scriptures and the teacher, control of the body and organs, etc. becomes the instrument for realizing the Self. Again, since there exist inference and scriptures for Its realization, it is mere bravado to say that Knowledge does not arise. And it has to be granted that when knowledge arises, it surely eliminates ignorance, its opposite. And that ignorance has been shown in, 'I am the killer', 'I am killed', and 'both of them do not know' (see 2.19). And here also it is shown that the idea of the Self being an agent, the object of an action, or an indirect agent, is the result of ignorance. Also, the Self being changeless, the fact that such agentship etc. are cuased by ignorance is a common factor in all actions without exception, because only that agent who is subject to change instigates someone else who is different from himself and can be acted on, saying, 'Do this.'
Thus, with a view to pointing out the absence of fitness for rites and duties in the case of an enlightened person, the Lord [Ast, adds vasudeva after 'Lord'.-Tr.] says, 'He who knows this One as indestructible,' 'how can that person,' etc.  thery denying this direct and indirect agentship of an enlightened person in respect of all actions without exception. As regards the estion, 'For what, again, is the man of enlightenment alified?', the answer has already been give earlier in, 'through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization' (3.3). Similarly, the Lord will also speak of renunication of all actions in, 'having given up all actions mentally,' etc.(5.13).
Objection: May it not be argued that from the expression, 'mentally', (it follows that) oral and bodily actions are not to be renounced?
Vedantin: No, because of the categoric expression, 'all actions'.
Objection: May it not be argued that 'all actions' relates only to those of the mind?
Vedantin: No, because all oral and bodily actions are preceded by those of the mind, for those actions are impossible in the absence of mental activity.
Objection: May it not be said that one has to mentally renounce all other activities except the mental functions which are the causes of scriptural rites and duties performed through speech and body?
Vedantin: No, because it has been specifically expressed: 'without doing or causing (others) to do anything at all' (5.13).
Objection: May it not be that this renunciation of all actions, as stated by the Lord, is with regard to a dying man, not one living?
Vedantin: No, because (in that case) the specific statement, 'The embodied man৷৷.continues happily in the town of nine gates' (ibid.) will become illogical since it is not possible for a dead person, who neither acts nor makes others act, [The words 'akurvatah akarayatah, (of him) who neither acts nor makes others act', have been taken as a part of the Commentator's arguement. But A.G. points out that they can also form a part of the next Objection. In that, case, the translation of the Objection will be this: Can it not be that the construction of the sentence (under discussion) is  Neither doing nor making others do, he rest by depositing (sannyasya, by renouncing) in the body', but not 'he rests in the body by renouncing৷৷.'?] to rest in that body after renouncing all actions.
 
Objection: Can it not be that the construction of the sentence (under discussion) is, '(he rests) by depositing (sannyasya, by renouncing) in the body', (but) not 'he rests in the body by renouncing৷৷.'?
Vedantin: No, because everywhere it is categorically asserted that the Self is changeless. Besides, the action of 'resting' reires a location, whereas renunciation is independent of this. The word nyasa preceded by sam here means 'renunciation', not 'depositing'. Therefore, according to this Scripture, viz the Gita, the man of realization is eligible for renunciation, alone, not for rites and duties. This we shall show in the relevant texts later on in the cotext of the knowledge of the Self.
And now we shall speak of the matter on hand: As to that, the indestructibility [Indestructibility suggests unchangeability as well.] of the Self, has been postulated. What is it like? That is being said in, 'As after rejecting wornout clothes,' etc.
2.22 Just as a man casts off worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so also the embodied Self casts off worn-out bodies and enters others which are new.
2.22 As a man discards his threadbare robes and puts on new, so the Spirit throws off Its worn-out bodies and takes fresh ones.
2.22. Just as rejecting the tattered garments, a man takes other new ones,  in the same way,  rejecting the decayed bodies,  the embodied (Self) rightly proceeds to other new ones.
2.22 As a man casts off worn-out garments and puts on others that are new, so does the embodied self cast off Its worn-out bodies and enter into others that are new.
2.22 As after rejecting wornout clothes a man takes up other new ones, likewise after rejecting wornout bodies the embodied one unites with other new ones.
2.22 That those who give up their bodies in a righteous war get more beauteous bodies than before, is known through the scriptures. Casting off worn-out garments and taking new and beautiful ones, can be only a cause of joy, as seen here in the world in the case of new garments.

Once again Sri Krsna emphasises for easy understanding the indestructibility of the self, taught before:  'Know that to be indestructible by which all this is pervaded' (II.17) and confirms it thus:
2.22 Vasamsi etc.  just as a well - dressed person, on the destruction of his garment, gets himself dressed in another more suitable garment, and he does not perish on that account, in the same way the Self, dressed with different bodies [behaves].
2.22 Yatha, as in the world; vihaya, after rejecting jirnani, wornout; vasamsi, clothes; narah, a man grhnati, takes up; aparani, other; navani, new ones; tatha, likewise, in that very manner; vihaya, after rejecting; jirnani, wornout; sarirani, bodies; dehi, the embodied one, the Self which is surely unchanging like the man (in the example); samyati, unites with; anyani, other; navani, new ones. This is meaning.
2.23 Weapons cut It not, fire burns It not, water wets It not, wind dries It not.
2.23 Weapons cleave It not, fire burns It not, water drenches It not, and wind dries It not.
2.23. Weapons do not cut This;  fire does not burn This;  water does not (make) This wet;  and the wind does not make This dry.
2.23 Weapons do not cleave It (the self), fire does not burn It, waters do not wet It, and wind does not dry It.
2.23 Weapons do not cut It, fire does not burn It, water does not moisten It, and air does not dry It.
2.23 - 2.24 Weapons, fire, water and air are incapable of cleaving, burning, wetting and drying the self; for, the nature of the self is to pervade all elements; It is present everywhere; for, It is subtler than all the elements; It is not capable of being pervaded by them; and cleaving, burning, wetting and drying are actions which can take place only by pervading a substance. Therefore the self is eternal. It is stable, immovable and primeval. The meaning is that It is unchanging, unshakable and ancient.
2.23 See Comment under 2.25
2.23 Why does It verily remain unchanged? This is being answered in, 'Weapons do not cut It,' etc. Sastrani, weapons; na, do not; chindanti, cut; enam, It, the embodied one under discussion. It being partless, weapons like sword etc. do not cut off Its limbs. So also, even pavakah, fire; na dahati enam, does not burn, does not reduce It to ashes. Ca, and similarly; apah, water; na enam kledayanti, does not moisten It. For water has the power of disintegrating a substance that has parts, by the process of moistening it. That is not possible in the case of the partless Self. Similarly, air destroys an oil substance by drying up the oil. Even marutah, air; na sosayati, does not dry; (enam, It,) one's own Self. [Ast. reads 'enam tu atmanam, but this Self', in place of enam svatmanam.-Tr.]
2.24 This Self cannot be cut, burnt, wetted, nor dried up. It is eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable and ancient.
2.24 It is impenetrable; It can be neither drowned nor scorched nor dried. It is Eternal, All-pervading, Unchanging, Immovable and Most Ancient.
2.24. This is not to be cut;  This is not to be burnt;  (This is) not to  be made wet and not to be dried too;  This is eternal, all-pervading,  stable, immobile and eternal.
2.24 It cannot be cleft; It cannot be burnt; It cannot be wetted and It cannot be dried, It is eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable and primeval.
2.24 It cannot be cut, It cannot be burnt, cannot be moistened, and surely cannot be dried up. It is eternal, omnipresent, stationary, unmoving and changeless.
2.23 - 2.24 Weapons, fire, water and air are incapable of cleaving, burning, wetting and drying the self; for, the nature of the self is to pervade all elements; It is present everywhere; for, It is subtler than all the elements; It is not capable of being pervaded by them; and cleaving, burning, wetting and drying are actions which can take place only by pervading a substance. Therefore the self is eternal. It is stable, immovable and primeval. The meaning is that It is unchanging, unshakable and ancient.
2.24 See Comment under 2.25
2.24 Since this is so, therefore ayam, It; acchedyah, cannot be cut. Since the other elements which are the causes of destruction of one ano ther are not capable of destroying this Self, therefore It is nityah, eternal. Being eternal, It is sarva-gatah, omnipresent. Being omnipresent, It is sthanuh, stationary, i.e. fixed like a stump. Being fixed, ayam, this Self; is acalah, unmoving. Therefore It is sanatanah, changeless, i.e. It is not produced from any cause, as a new thing.
 
It is not to be argued that 'these verses are repetive since eternality and changelessness of the Self have been stated in a single verse itself, "Never is this One born, and never does It die," etc. (20). Whatever has been said there (in verse 19) about the Self does not go beyond the meaning of this verse. Something is repeated with those very words, and something ideologically.' Since the object, viz the Self, is inscrutable, therefore Lord Vasudeva raises the topic again and again, and explains that very object in other words so that, somehow, the unmanifest Self may come within the comprehension of the intellect of the transmigrating persons and bring about a cessation of their cycles of births and deaths.
2.25 This (Self) is said to be unmanifested, unthinkable and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing This to be such, thou shouldst not grieve.
2.25 It is named the Unmanifest, the Unthinkable, the immutable. Wherefore, knowing the Spirit as such, thou hast no cause to grieve.
2.25. This is declared to be non-evident,  imponderable,  and unchangeable.  Therefore understanding This as such you should not lament.
2.25 This (self) is said to be unmanifest, inconceivable and unchanging. Therefore, knowing It thus, it does not  befit you to grieve.
2.25 It is said that This is unmanifest; This is inconceivable; This is unchangeable. Therefore, having known This thus, you ougth not to grieve.
2.25 The self is not made manifest by those Pramanas (means of knowledge) by which objects susceptible of being cleft etc., are made manifest; hence It is unmanifest, being different in kind from objects susceptible to cleaving etc., It is inconceivable, being different in kind from all objects. As It does not possess the essential nature of any of them. It cannot even be conceived. Therefore, It is unchanging, incapable of modifications. So knowing this self to be possessed of the above mentioned alities, it does not become you to feel grief for Its sake.
2.23-25 Nainam etc. upto arhasi. The weapons etc., that cause destruction, haldly do anything to This.  For, being, by nature, exclusively pure Consciousness, remaining without support, having no component parts and being independent, this cannot be destroyed through the process of either assumption of an altogether  different nature, or the destruction of the support, or the mutual separation of the component parts, or the rise of an opponent, and so on.  Nor the act to going to another body is a new thing for This.  For, even when This is [apparently] with a single body,  This travels always to different body; for the body does not remain the same even for a moment.  By understanding this Self to be as such, you should not lament This.
2.25 Moreover, ucyate, it is said that; ayam, This, the Self; is avyaktah, unmanifest, since, being beyond the ken of all the organs, It cannot be objectified. For this very reason, ayam, This; is acintyah, inconceivable. For anything that comes within the purview of the organs becomes the object of thought. But this Self is inconceivable becuase It is not an object of the organs. Hence, indeed, It is avikaryah, unchangeable. This Self does not change as milk does when mixed with curd, a curdling medium, etc. And It is chnageless owing to partlessness, for it is not seen that any non-composite thing is changeful. Not being subject to transformation, It is said to be changeless. Tasmat, therefore; vidivata, having known; enam, this one, the Self; evam, thus, as described; na arhasi, you ought not; anusocitum, to grieve, thinking, 'I am the slayer of these; these are killed by me.'
2.26 But even if thou thinkest of It as being constantly born and constantly dying, even then, O mighty-armed, thou shouldst not grieve.
2.26 Even if thou thinkest of It as constantly being born, constantly dying, even then, O Mighty Man, thou still hast no cause to grieve.
2.26. On the other hand, if you deem This as being born constantly or as dying constantly,  even then,  O mighty-armed one,  you should not lament This.
2.26 Or if you hold this self as being constantly born and as constantly dying, even then, O mighty-armed one, it does not become you to feel grief.
2.26 On the other hand, if you think this One is born continually or dies constantly, even then, O mighty-armed one, you ought not to grieve thus.
2.26 Besides, if you consider this self as identical with the body, which is constantly born and constantly dies - which is nothing other than these characteristics of the body mentioned above -, even then it does not become you to feel grief; because, birth and death are inevitable for the body, whose nature is modification.
2.26 Atha va etc.  On the other hand if you deam  'This'  to be the body and to be born constantly,-because its stream  does not stop-even then, there is no necessity to lament.  Or, if, following the [Vainasika Buddhists' ?]  doctrine of continuous decay of things, you deem This to be constantly dying, even then where is the need for lamenting ?  If you, in the same manner, deem the Self to be constantly born or to be constantly dying on account of Its contacts and separations with bodies, even then it is unwarranted, on every account, on the part of the men of rational thinking, to lament.	
 Otherwise this [division of]  permanence and impermanence does not stand reasoning.  For-
2.26 This (verse), 'On the other hand,' etc., is uttered assuming that the Self is transient. Atha ca, on the other hand, if ( conveys the sense of assumption ); following ordinary experience, manyase, you think; enam, this One, the Self under discussion; is nityajatam, born continually, becomes born with the birth of each of the numerous bodies; va, or; nityam, constantly; mrtam, dies, along with the death of each of these (bodies); tatha api, even then, even if the Self be of that nature; tvam, you; maha-baho, O mighty-armed one; na arhasi, ought not; socitum, to grieve; evam, thus, since that which is subject to birth will die, and that which is subject to death will be born; these two are inevitable.
2.27 For certain is death for the born, and certain is birth for the dead; therefore, over the inevitable thou shouldst not grieve.
2.27 For death is as sure for that which is born, as birth is for that which is dead. Therefore grieve not for what is inevitable.
2.27. Death is certain indeed for what is born;  and birth is certain for what is dead.  Therefore you should not lament over a thing that is unavoidable.
2.27 For, death is certain for the born, and re-birth is certain for the dead; therefore you should not feel grief for what is inevitable.
2.27 For death of anyone born is certain, and of the dead (re-) birth is a certainly. Therefore you ought not to grieve over an inevitable fact.
2.27 For what has originated, destruction is certain - it is seen to be inevitable. Similarly what has perished will inevitably originate. How should this be understood - that there is origination for that (entity)which has perished?  It is seen that an existing entity only can originate and not a non-existent one. Origination, annihilation etc., are merely particular states of an existent entity.

Now thread etc., do really exist. When arranged in a particular way, they are called clothes etc. It is seen that even those who uphold the doctrine that the effect is a new entity (Asatkarya-vadins) will admit this much that no new entity over and above the particular arrangement of threads is seen. It is not tenable to hold that this is the coming into being of a new entity, since, by the process of manufacture there is only attainment of a new name and special functions. No new entity emerges.

Origination, annihilation etc., are thus particular stages of an existent entity. With regard to an entity which has entered into a stage known as origination, its entry into the opposite condition is called annihilation. Of an evolving entity, a seqence of evolutionary stages is inevitable. For instance, clay becomes a lump, jug, a potsherd, and (finally) powder. Here, what is called annihilation is the attainment of a succeeding stage by an entity which existed previously in a preceding stage. And this annihilation itself is called birth in that stage. Thus, the seence called birth and annihilation being inevitable for an evolving entity, it is not worthy of you to grieve.

Now Sri Krsna says that not even the slightest grief arising from seeing an entity passing from a previous existing stage to an opposite stage, is justifiable in regard to human beings etc.
2.27  Jatasya etc.  Destruction comes after birth, and after the destruction comes birth.  Thus, this series of birth-and-death is like a circle.  Hence to what extent is this to be lamented for ?	
 Furthermore-
2.27 This being so, 'death of anyone born', etc. Hi, for; mrtyuh, death; jatasya, of anyone born; dhruvah, is certain; is without exception; ca, and mrtasya, of the dead; janmah, (re-) birth; is dhruvam, a certainly. Tasmat, therefore, this fact, viz birth and death, is inevitable. With regard to that (fact), apariharye, over an enevitable; arthe, fact; tvam, you; na arhasi, ought not; socitum, to grieve.
2.28 Beings are unmanifested in their beginning, manifested in their middle state, O Arjuna, and unmanifested again in their end. What is there to grieve about?
2.28 The end and the beginning of beings are unknown. We see only the intervening formations. Then what cause is there for grief?
2.28. O descendant of Bharata !   The beings have  an unmanifest beginning,  manifest middle and certainly the unmanifest end.  On that account why mourning?
2.28 O Arjuna, beings have an unknown beginning, a known middle and an unknown end. What is there to grieve over in all this?
2.28 O descendant of Bharata, all beings remain unmanifest in the beginning;; they become manifest in the middle. After death they certainly become unmanifest. What lamentation can there be with regard to them?
2.28 Human beings etc., (i.e., bodies) exist as entities; their previous stages are unknown, their middle stages in the form of man etc., are known, and their (final) and future stages are unknown. As they thus exist in their own natural stages, there is no cause for grief.

After thus saying that there is no cause for grief even according to the view which identifies the body with the self, Sri Krsna proceeds to say that it is hard to find one who can be said to have truly perceived the Atman or spoken about It or heard about It or gained a true conception of It by hearing. For the Atman, which is actually different from the body, is of a wonderful nature.
2.28 Avyaktadini etc. Whether beings are permanent or impermanent, this much is certain :  The person, who laments over a given object - as far as that person is concerned, that object is at the beginning unmanifest and at the end also it is unmanifest.  Its manifestation in between is therefore a deviation from its natural state, Rather, there may be need to lament over the deviation from natural state and nor over the natural state [itself].  Further, whatever has been approved as its root cause, that itself  permanently exhibits, within itself, a variety of  different and endless creation, sustenance and absorption as its own manifold nature, in a set pattern.  Hence what is the necessity for lamenting over the same nature of this (its effect) ?	
 And enowed with the above mentioned nature-
2.28 It is not reasonable to grieve even for beings which are constituted by bodies and organs, since 'all beings remain unmanifest' etc. (Bharata, O descendant of Bharata;) bhutani, all beings, avyaktaduni, remain unmainfest in the beginning. Those beings, viz sons, friends, and others, constituted by bodies and organs, [Another reading is karya-karana-sanghata, aggregates formed by material elements acting as causes and effects.-Tr.] who before their origination have unmanifestedness (avyakta), invisibility, nonperception, as their beginning (adi) are avyaktaadini. Ca, and; after origination, before death, they become vyakta-madhyani, manifest in the middle. Again, they eva, certainly; become avyakta-nidhanani, unmanifest after death. Those which have unmanifestness (avyakta), invisibility, as their death (nidhana) are avyakta-nidhanani. The idea is that even after death they verily attain unmanifestedness. Accordingly has it been said: 'They emerged from invisibility, and have gone back to invisibility. They are not yours, nor are you theirs. What is this fruitless lamentation!' (Mbh. St. 2.13). Ka, what; paridevana, lamentation, or what prattle, can there be; tatra, with regard to them, i.e. with regard to beings which are objects of delusion, which are invisible, (become) visible, (and then) get destroyed!
2.29 One sees This (the Self) as a wonder; another speaks of It as a wonder; another hears of It as a wonder; yet having heard, none understands It at all.
2.29 One hears of the Spirit with surprise, another thinks It marvellous, the third listens without comprehending. Thus, though many are told about It, scarcely is there one who knows It.
2.29. This someone observes as a wonder; similarly another speaks of This as a wonder;  another hears This as a wonder;  but even after hearing,  not even one understands This.
2.29 One looks upon This (self) as a wonder; likewise another speaks of It as a wonder; still another hears of It as a wonder; and even after hearing of It, one knows It not.
2.29 Someone visualizes It as a wonder; and similarly indeed, someone else talks of It as a wonder; and someone else hears of It as a wonder. And some one else, indeed, does not realize It even after hearing about It.
2.29 Among innumerable beings, someone, who by great austerity has got rid of sins and has increased his merits, realises this self possessing the above mentioned nature, which is wonderful and distinct in kind from all things other than Itself. Such a one speaks of It to another. Thus, someone hears of It. And even after hearing of It, no one knows It exactly that It really exists. The term 'ca' (and) implies that even amongst the seers, the speakers and hearers, one with authentic percepetion, authentic speech and authentic hearing, is a rarity.
2.39 Ascaryavat etc. But, if this Self is, in this manner, changeless (or destructionless), why is This not observed just as such by all ?  It is so because, as if by a rare chance, only some one observes [This].  Even after listening, not even one understands This i.e., realises This.
2.29 'This Self under discussion is inscrutable. Why should I blame you alone regarding a thing that is a source of delusion to all!' How is this Self inscrutable? [It may be argued that the Self is the object of egoism. The answer is: Although the individualized Self is the object of egoism, the absolute Self is not.] This is being answered in, 'Someone visualizes It as a wonder,' etc.
Kascit, someone; pasyati, visualizes; enam, It, the Self; ascaryavat, as a wonder, as though It were a wonder  a wonder is something not seen before, something strange, something seen all on a sudden; what is comparable to that is ascarya-vat; ca, and; tatha, similarly; eva, indeed; kascit, someone; anyah, else; vadati, talks of It as a wonder. And someone else srnoti, hears of It as a wonder. And someone, indeed, na, does not; veda, realize It; api, even; srutva, after hearing, seeing and speaking about It.
Or, (the meaning is) he who sees the Self is like a wonder. He who speaks of It and the who hears of It is indeed rare among many thousands. Therefore, the idea is that the Self is difficult to understand.
Now, in the course of concluding the topic under discussion, [viz the needlessness of sorrow and delusion,from the point of view of the nature of things.] He says, 'O descendant of Bharata, this embodied Self', etc.
2.3 Yield not to impotence, O Arjuna, son of Pritha. It does not befit thee. Cast off this mean weakness of the heart! Stand up, O scorcher of the foes!
2.3 O Arjuna! Why give way to unmanliness? O thou who art the terror of thine enemies! Shake off such shameful effeminacy, make ready to act!
2.3. Stoop not to unmanliness,  O son of Kunti !   It does not befit you.  Shirking off the petty weakness of heart,  arise,  O scorcher of the foes !
2.3 Yield not to unmanliness, O Arjuna, it does not become you. Shake off this base faint-heartedness and arise, O scorcher of foes!
2.3  O Partha, yield not to unmanliness. This does not befit you. O scorcher of foes, arise, giving up the petty weakness of the heart.
2.1 - 2.3 Sanjaya said - Lord said  When Arjuna thus sat, the Lord, opposing his action, said:  'What is the reason for your misplaced grief?  Arise for battle, abandoning this grief, which has arisen in a critical situation, which can come only in men of wrong understanding, which is an obstacle for reaching heaven, which does not confer fame on you, which is very mean, and which is caused by faint-heartedness.
2.3 Sri Abhinavagupta did not comment upon this sloka.
2.30 This, the Indweller in the body of everyone, is ever indestructible, O Arjuna; therefore, thou shouldst not grieve for any creature.
2.30 Be not anxious about these armies. The Spirit in man is imperishable.
2.30. O descendant of Bharata !  This embodied One in the body of every one is for ever incapable of being slain.  Therefore you should not lament over all beings.
2.30 The self in the body, O Arjuna, is eternal and indestructible. This is so in the case of the selves in all bodies. Therefore, it is not fit for you to feet grief for any being.
2.30 O descendant of Bharata, this embodied Self existing in everyone's body can never be killed. Therefore you ought not to grieve for all (these) beings.
2.30 The self within the body of everyone such as gods etc., must be considered to be eternally imperishable, though the body can be killed. Therefore, all beings from gods to immovable beings, even though they possess different forms, are all uniform and eternal in their nature as described above. The ineality and the perishableness pertain only to the bodies. Therefore, it is not fit for you to feel grief for any of the beings beginning from gods etc., and not merely for Bhisma and such others.
2.30 Dehi etc. On these grounds, the permanent destruction-lessness of the Self [is established].
2.30 Because of being partless and eternal, ayam, this dehi, embodied Self; nityam avadhyah, can never be killed, under any condition. That being so, although existing sarvasya dehe, in all bodies, in trees etc., this One cannot be killed on account of Its being allpervasive. Since the indewelling One cannot be killed although the body of everyone of the living beings be killed, tasmat, therefore; tvam, you; na arhasi, ought not; socitum, to grieve; for sarvani bhutani, all (these) beings, for Bhisma and others.
Here [i.e. in the earlier verse.] it has been said that, from the standpoint of the supreme Reality, there is no occasion for sorrow or delusion. (This is so) not merely from the standpoint of the supreme Reality, but
2.31 Further, having regard to thy duty, shouldst not waver, for there is nothing higher for a Kshatriya than a righteous war.
2.31 Thou must look at thy duty. Nothing can be more welcome to a soldier than a righteous war. Therefore to waver in this resolve is unworthy, O Arjuna!
2.31. Further,  considering your own duty, you should not waver. Indeed,  for a Ksatriya there exists no duty superior to fighting a righteous war.
2.31 Further, considering also your own duty, it does not befit you to waver. For, to a Ksatriya, there is no greater good than a righteous war.
2.31 Even considering your own duty you should not waver, since there is nothing else better for a Ksatriya than a righteous battle.
2.31 Further, even though there is killing of life in this war which has begun, it is not fit for you to waver, considering your own duty, as in the Agnisomiya and other sacrifices involving slaughter. To a Ksatriya, there is no greater good than a righteous war, begun for a just cause. It will be declared in the Gita:  'Valour, non-defeat (by the enemies), fortitude, adroitness and also not fleeing from battle, generosity, lordliness - these are the duties of the Ksatriya born of his very nature.' (18.43).

In Agnisomiya etc., no injury is caused to the animal to be immolated; for, according to the Vedic Text, the victim, a he-goat, after abandoning an inferior body, will attain heaven etc., with a beautiful body. The Text pertaining to immolation declares:  'O animal, by this (immolation) you will never die, you are not destroyed. You will pass through happy paths to the realm of the gods, where the virtuous only reach and not the sinful. May the god Savitr give you a proper place.' (Yaj. 4.6.9.46). Likewise the attainment of more beautiful bodies by those who die here in this war has been declared in the Gita, 'As a man casts off worn-out garments and takes others that are new ৷৷.' (2.22). Hence, just as lancing and such other operations of a surgeon are for curing a patient, the immolation of the sacrificial animal in the Agnisomiya etc., is only for its good.
2.31 Sva-Dharmam etc. Because one's duty cannot be avoided, wavering with regard to fighting the war is not proper [on the part of Arjuna].
2.31 Api, even; aveksya, considering; svadharmam, your own duty, the duty of a Ksatriya, viz battle  considering even that  ; na arhasi, you ought not; vikampitum, to waver, to deviate from the natural duty of the Ksatriya, i.e. from what is natural to yourself. And hi, since that battle is not devoid of righteousness, (but) is supremely righteous  it being conducive to virtue and meant for protection of subjects through conest of the earth ; therefore, na vidyate, there is nothing; anyat, else; sreyah, better; ksatriyasya, for a ksatriya; than that dharmyat, righteous; yuddhat, battle.
2.32 Happy are the Kshatriyas, O Arjuna! who are called upon to fight in such a battle that comes of itself as an open door to heaven.
2.32 Blessed are the soldiers who find their opportunity. This opportunity has opened for thee the gates of heaven.
2.32. O son of  Prtha !  By good fortune,  Ksatriyas,  desirous of happiness,  get a war of this type [to fight], which has come on its own accord and which is an open door to the heaven.
2.32 Happy are the Ksatriyas, O Arjuna, to whom a war like this comes of its own accord; it opens the gate to heaven.
2.32 O son of Partha, happy are the Ksatriyas who come across this kind of a battle, which presents itself unsought for and which is an open gate to heaven.
2.32 Only the fortunate Ksatriyas, i.e., the meritorious ones, gian such a war as this, which has come unsought, which is the means for the attainment of immeasurable bliss, and  which gives an unobstructed pathway to heaven.
2.32 Yadrcchaya etc.  A war of this nature, because it is conducive to the heaven, should not be avoided even by other such Ksatriyas who are full of desires  How much less [it is to be avoided] in the case of one to whom the science of knowledge of this nature has been taught ?  This is what is intended to be conveyed [here]  And the verse does not at all end with [determining how to attain] the heaven. 
 The very thing (i.e. sin), fearing which you withdraw from the battle, will befall you branching off hundredfold.  This [the Lord] says-
2.32 Why, again, does that battle become a duty? This is being answered (as follows) [A specific rule is more authoritative than a general rule. Non-violence is a general rule enjoined by the scriptures, but the duty of fighting is a specific rule for a Ksatriya.]: Partha, O son of Partha; are not those Ksatiryas sukhinah, happy [Happy in this world as also in the other.] who labhante, come across; a yuddham, battle; idrsam, of this kind; upapannam, which presents itself; yadrcchaya, unsought for; and which is an apavrtam, open; svarga-dvaram, gate to heaven? [Rites and duties like sacrifices etc. yield their results after the lapse of some time. But the Ksatriyas go to heaven immediatley after dying in battle, because, unlike the minds of others, their minds remaind fully engaged in their immediate duty.]
2.33 But if thou wilt not fight this righteous war, then having abandoned thine own duty and fame, thou shalt incur sin.
2.33 Refuse to fight in this righteous cause, and thou wilt be a traitor, lost to fame, incurring only sin.
2.33. On the other hand,  if you will not fight this righteous war then you shall incur the sin by avoiding your own duty and fame.
2.33 But if you do not fight this righteous war, you will be turning away from your duty and honoured position, and will be incurring sin.
2.33 On the other hand, if you will not fight this righteous battle, then, forsaking your own duty and fame, you will incur sin.
2.33 If in delusion, you do not wage this war, which has started and which is the duty of a Ksatriya, then, owing to the non-performance of your immediate and incumbent duty, you will lose the immeasurable bliss which is the fruit of discharging your duty and the immeasurable fame which is the fruit of victory. In addition, you will incur extreme sin.
2.33 See Comment under 2.37
2.33 Atha, on the other hand; cet, if; tvam, you; na karisyasi, will not fight; even imam, this; dharmyam, righteous; samgramam, battle, which has presented itself as a duty, which is not opposed to righteousness, and which is enjoined (by the scriptures); tatah, then, because of not undertaking that; hitva, forsaking; sva-dharmam, your own duty; ca, and; kritim, fame, earned from encountering Mahadeva (Lord Siva) and others; avapsyasi, you will incur; only papam, sin.
2.34 People, too, will recount thy everlasting dishonour; and to one who has been honoured, dishonour is worse than death.
2.34 Men will talk forever of thy disgrace; and to the noble, dishonour is worse than death.
2.34. The creatures will speak of  your endless ill-fame;  and for the one who has been highly esteemed the illfame is worse than death.
2.34 Further, people will speak ill of you for all time, and for one accustomed to be honoured, dishonour is worse than death.
2.34 People also will speak of your unending infamy. And to an honoured person infamy is worse than death.
2.34 You will then incur not merely the loss of all happiness and honour but will be the object of disrespect by all people, the alifies and even the unalified, for all time. They will ridicule you saying, 'When the battle began, Arjuna ran away.' It it be asked, 'What if it be so?", the reply is:  'To one who is honoured by all for courage, prowess, valour, etc., this kind of dishonour arising from the reverse of these attributes, is worse than death?  The meaning is that itself would be better for you than this kind of dishonour.

If it is said, 'How could dishonour accrue to me, who am a hero, but have withdrawn from the battle only out of love and compassion for my relatives?'  the reply is as follows:
2.34 See Comment under 2.37
2.34 Not only will there be the giving up of your duty and fame, but bhutani, people; ca api, also; kathayisyanti, will speak; te, of your; avyayam, unending, perpetual; akrtim, infamy. Ca, and; sambhavitasya, to an honoured person, to a person honoured with such epithets as 'virtuous', 'heroic', etc.; akirtih, infamy; atiricyate, is worse than; maranat, death. The meaning is that, to an honoured person death is perferable to infamy.
2.35 The great car-warriors will think that thou hast withdrawn from the battle through fear; and thou wilt be lightly held by them who have thought much of thee.
2.35 Great generals will think that thou hast fled from the battlefield through cowardice; though once honoured thou wilt seem despicable.
2.35. The mighty charioteers will  think of you as having withdrawn from the battle out of fear :  having been highly regarded by these men,  you shall be viewed lightly.
2.35 The great warriors will think that you have fled from battle in fear. These men who held you in high esteem will speak lightly of you now.
2.35 The great chariot-riders will think of you as having desisted from the fight out of fear; and you will into disgrace before them to whom you had been estimable.
2.35 Great warriors like Karna, Duryodhana, etc., hitherto held you in high esteem as a heroic enemy. Now by refraining from battle when it has begun, you will appear to them as despicable and easily defeatable. These great warriors will think of you as withdrawing from battle out of fear. Because turning away from battle does not happen in the case of brave enemies through affection etc., for relatives. It can happen only through fear of enemies.

Moreover
2.35 See Comment under 2.37
2.35 Moreover, maharathah, the great chariot-riders, Duryodhana and others; mamsyante, will think; tvam, of you; as uparatam, having desisted; ranat, from the fight; not out of compassion, but bhayat, out of fear of Karna and others; ca, and ; yasyasi laghavam, you will again fall into disgrace before them, before Duryodhana and others; yesam, to whom; tvam, you; bahumato bhutva, had been estimable as endowed with many alities.
2.36 Thy enemies also, cavilling at thy power, will speak many abusive words. What is more painful than this?
2.36 Thine enemies will spread scandal and mock at thy courage. Can anything be more humiliating?
2.36. Slandering your ability,  the enemies will talk of you many sayings that should not be talked of.  Is there anything more painful than that ?
2.36 Your enemies, slandering your prowess, will use words which should never be uttered. What could be more painful than that?
2.36 And your enemies will speak many indecent words while denigrating your might. What can be more painful than that?
2.36 Moreover, your enemies, the sons of Dhrtarastra, will make many remarks unutterably slanderous and disparaging to heroes, saying, 'How can this Partha stand in the presence of us, who are heroes, even for a moment?  His prowess is elsewhere than in our presence.' Can there be anything more painful to you than this?  You yourself will understand that death is preferable to subjection to disparagement of this kind.

Sri Krsna now says that for a hero, enemies being slain by oneself and oneself being slain by enemies are both conducive to supreme bliss.
2.36 See Comment under 2.37
2.36 Ca, and besieds; tava, your; ahitah, enemies; vadisyanti, will speak; bahun, many, various kinds of; avacya-vadan, indecent words, unutterable words; nindantah, while denigrating, scorning; tava, your; samarthyam, might earned from battles against Nivatakavaca and others. Therefore, kim nu, what can be; duhkhataram, more painful; tatah, than that, than the sorrow arising from being scorned? That is to say, there is no greater pain than it.
2.37 Slain, thou wilt obtain heaven; victorious, thou wilt enjoy the earth; therefore, stand up, O son of Kunti, resolved to fight.
2.37 If killed, thou shalt attain Heaven; if victorious, enjoy the kingdom of earth. Therefore arise, O Son of Kunti, and fight!
2.37. If you are slain you shall attain heaven; or if you coner,  you shall enjoy the earth.  Therefore, O son of  Kunti !  stand up with resolution made in favour of [fighting] the battle.
2.37 If slain, you shall win heaven; or if victorious, you shall enjoy the earth. Therefore, arise, O Arjuna, resolved to fight.
2.37 Either by being killed you will attain heaven, or by winning you will enjoy the earth. Therefore, O Arjuna, rise up with determination for fighting.
2.37 If you are slain in a righteous war by enemies, you shall thery attain supreme bliss. Or, slaying the enemies, you shall enjoy this kingdom without obstacles. As the duty called war, when done without attachment to the fruits, becomes the means for winning supreme bliss, you will attain that supreme bliss. Therefore, arise, assured that engagement in war (here the duty) is the means for attaining release, which is known as man's supreme goal. This alone is suitable for you, the son of Kunti. This is the purport.

Sri Krsna then explains to the aspirant for liberation how to conduct oneself in war.
2.33-37  Atha ca etc., upto krta-niscavah.  Accepting what the opponent has stated, this pentad of verses is narrated as an argument : 'If your goodself prefers to abide by the generally accepted practice, even then this [fighting] must be undertaken necessarily'.
2.37 Again, by undertaking the fight with Karna and others, va, either; hatah, by being killed; prapsyasi, you will attain; svargam, heaven; or jitva, by winning over Karna and other heroes; bhoksyase, you will enjoy; mahim, the earth. The purport is that in either case you surely stand to gain. Since this is so, Kaunteya, O son of Kunti; tasmat, therefore; uttistha, rise up; krta-niscayah, with determination; yuddhaya, for fighting, i.e. with the determination, 'I shall either defeat the enemies or shall die.'
2.38 Having made pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat the same, engage thou in battle for the sake of battle; thus thou shalt not incur sin.
2.38 Look upon pleasure and pain, victory and defeat, with an equal eye. Make ready for the combat, and thou shalt commit no sin.
2.38. Viewing alike,  pleasure and pain,  gain and loss,  victory and defeat,  you should get then ready for the battle.  Thus you will not incur sin.
2.38 Holding pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat as alike, gird yourself up for the battle. Thus, you shall not incur any sin.
2.38 Treating happiness and sorrow, gain and loss, and conest and defeat with eanimity, then engage in battle. Thus you will not incur sin.
2.38 Thus, knowing the self to be eternal, different from the body and untouched by all corporeal alities, remaining unaffected by pleasure and pain resulting from the weapon-strokes etc., inevitable in a war, as also by gain and loss of wealth, victory and defeat, and keeping yourself free from attachment to heaven and such other frutis, begin the battle considering  it merely as your own duty. Thus, you will incur no sin. Here sin means transmigratory existence which is misery. The purport is that you will be liberarted from the bondage of transmigratory existence.

Thus, after teaching the knowledge of the real nature of the self, Sri Krsna begins to expound the Yoga of work, which, when preceded by it (i.e., knowledge of the self), constitutes the means for liberation.
2.38 Sukha-duhkhe etc.  For you, performing actions as your own duty, never there is any connection with sin.
2.38 As regards that, listen to this advice for you then you are engaged in battle considering it to be your duty: Krtva, treating; sukha-duhkhe, happiness and sorrow; same, with eanimity, i.e. without having likes and dislikes; so also treating labha-alabhau, gain and loss; jaya-ajayau, conest and defeat, as the same; tatah, then; yuddhaya yujyasva, engage in battle. Evam, thus by undertaking the fight; na avapsyasi, you will not incur; papam, sin. This advice is incidental. [The context here is that of the philosophy of the supreme Reality. If fighting is enjoined in that context, it will amount to accepting combination of Knowledge and actions. To avoid this contingency the Commentator says, 'incidental'. That is to say, although the context is of the supreme Reality, the advice to fight is incidental. It is not an injunction to combine Knowledge with actions, since fighting is here the natural duty of Arjuna as a Ksatriya.].
The generally accepted argument for the removal of sorrow and delusion has been stated in the verses beginning with, 'Even considering your own duty' (31), etc., but this has not been presented by accepting that as the real intention (of the Lord).
The real context here (in 2.12 etc.), however, is of the realization of the supreme Reality. Now, in order to show the distinction between the (two) topics dealt with in this scripture, the Lord concludes that topic which has been presented above (in 2.20 etc.), by saying, 'This (wisdom) has been imparted,' etc. For, if the distinction between the topics of the scripute be shown here, then the instruction relating to the two kinds of adherences   as stated later on in, 'through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization; through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' (3.3)  will proceed again smoothly, and the hearer also will easily comprehend it by keeping in view the distinction between the topics. Hence the Lord says:
2.39 This, which has been taught to thee, is wisdon concerning Sankhya. Now listen to wisdom concerning Yoga, endowed with which, O Arjuna, thou shalt cast off the bonds of action.
2.39 I have told thee the philosophy of Knowledge. Now listen and I will explain the philosophy of Action, by means of which, O Arjuna, thou shalt break through the bondage of all action.
2.39. Listen,  how this knowledge,  imparted  [to you]  for your sankhya,  is [also] for the Yoga; endowed with which knowledge you shall cast off the bondage of action,  O son of Prtha !
2.39 This Buddhi concerning the self (Sankhya) has been imparted to you. Now listen to this with regard to Yoga, by following which you will get rid of the bondage of Karma.
2.39 O Partha, this wisdom has been imparted to you from the standpoint of Self-realization. But listen to this (wisdom) from the standpoint of Yoga, endowed with which wisdom you will get rid of the bondage of action.
2.39 'Sankhya' means 'intellect,' and the truth about the Atman, which is determinable by the intellect, is 'Sankhyam'. Concerning the nature of the self which has to be known, whatever Buddhi has to be taught, has been taught to you in the passage beginning with, 'It is not that I did not exist' (II.12) and ending with the words, 'Therefore, you shall not grieve for any being' (II.30). The disposition of mind (Buddhi) which is reired for the performance of works preceded by knowledge of the self and which thus constitutes the means of attaining release, that is here called by the term Yoga. It will be clearly told later on, 'Work done with desire for fruits is far inferior to work done with evennes of mind' (II. 49). What Buddhi or attitude of mind is reired for making your act deserve the name of Yoga, listen to it now. Endowed with that knowledge, you will be able to cast away the bondage of Karma. 'Karma-bandha' means the bondage due to Karma i.e., the bondage of Samsara.

Now Sri Krsna explains the glory of works associated with the Buddhi to be described hereafter:
2.39 Esa te etc.  And this knowledge in th form of determination has been declared [to you] for your sankhya, i.e., perfect  knowledge.  Now, how the self-same determinate knowledge is also taught for the Yoga  i.e., dexerity in action -  in that manner only you must listen to by means of which determinate knowledge you shall avoid the binding nature of the actions.  Truely, the actions do not themselves bind as they are insentient.  Hence, it is the Self which binds Itself by means of the actions in the form of mental impressions.
2.39 Partha, O son of Prtha (Arjuna); esa, this; buddhih, wisdom, the Knowledge which directly removes the defect (viz ignorance) that is responsible for sorrow, delusion, etc. [Mundane existence consists of attraction and repulsion, agentship and enjoyership, etc. These are the defects, and they arise from ignorance about one's Self. Enlightenment is the independent and sole cause that removes this ignorance.] constituting mundane existence; abhihita, has been imparted; te, to you; sankhye, from the standpoint of Self-realization, with regard to the discriminating knowledge of the supreme Reality. Tu, but; srnu, listen; imam, to this wisdom which will be imparted presently; yoge, from the spandpoint of Yoga, from the standpoint of the means of attaining it (Knowledge)  i.e., in the context of Karma-yoga, the performance of rites and duties with detachment after destroying the pairs of opposites, for the sake of adoring God, as also in the context of the practice of spiritual absorption.
As as inducement, He (the Lord) praises that wisdom: Yuktah, endowed; yaya, with which; buddhya, wisdom concerning Yoga; O Partha, prahasyasi, you will get rid of; karma-bandham, the bondage of action  action is itself the bondage described as righteousness and unrighteousness; you will get rid of that bondage by the attainment of Knowledge through God's grace. This is the idea.
2.4 Arjuna said  How, O Madhusudana, shall I fight in battle with arrows against Bhishma and Drona, who are fit to be worshipped, O destroyer of enemies?
2.4 Arjuna argued: My Lord! How can I, when the battle rages, send an arrow through Bheeshma and Drona, who should receive my reverence?
2.4. Arjuna said  How shall I with arrows fight in battle against Bhisma and Drona,  both being worthy of reverence ?   O slayer of  Mandhu,  O slayer of foes !
2.4 Arjuna said  How can I, O slayer of foes, aim arrows in battle against Bhisma and Drona who are worthy of reverence?
2.4  Arjuna said  O Madhusudana, O destroyer of enemies, how can I fight with arrows in battle against Bhisma and Drona who are worthy of adoration?
2.4 - 2.5 Arjuna said  Again Arjuna, being moved by love, compassion and fear, mistaking unrighteousness for righteousness, and not understanding, i.e., not knowing the beneficial words of Sri Krsna, said as follows:  'How can I slay Bhisma, Drona and others worthy or reverence?  After slaying those elders, though they are intensely attached to enjoyments, how can I enjoy those very pleasures which are now being enjoyed by them?  For, it will be mixed with  their blood.
2.4 See Comment under 2.6
2.40 In this there is no loss of effort, nor is there any harm (production of contrary results or transgression). Even a little of this knowledge (even a little practice of this Yoga) protects one from great fear.
2.40 On this Path, endeavour is never wasted, nor can it ever be repressed. Even a very little of its practice protects one from great danger.
2.40. Here there is no loss due to transgression,  and there exists no  contrary downward course (sin);  even a little of this righteous thing saves [one] from great danger.
2.40 Here, there is no loss of effort, nor any accrual of evil. Even a little of this Dharma (called Karma Yoga) protects a man from the great fear.
2.40 Here there is no waste of an attempt; nor is there (any) harm. Even a little of this righteousness saves (one) from great fear.
2.40 Here, in Karma Yoga, there is no loss of 'Abhikrama' or of effort that has been put in; 'loss' means the loss of efficacy to bring about the fruits. In Karma Yoga if work is begun and left unfinished, and the continuity is broken in the middle, it does not remain fruitless, as in the case of works undertaken for their fruits. No evil result is acired if the continuity of work is broken. Even a little of this Dharma known as Karma Yoga or Niskama Karma (unselfish action without desire for any reward) gives protection from the great fear, i.e., the fear of transmigratory existence.

The same purport is explained later thus:  'Neither in this world nor the next, O Arjuna, there is annihilation for him' (6.40). But in works, Vedic and secular, when there is interruption in the middle, not only do they not yield fruits, but also there is accrual of evil.

Now, Sri Krsna distinguishes the Buddhi or mental disposition concerned with those acts which constitute a means for attaining release from those which are concerned with the acts meant for gaining the desired objects:
2.40 Neha etc.  Here in this determinate knowledge there arises no loss through transgression, an offence due to negligence; because negligence is [itself] absent there.  And just as a burning oil in the boiler get cooled soon, due to a limited antity of sandal (put in it), in the same way due to this knowledge of Yoga-eventhough it is very little-the great danger in the form of the cycle of birth-and-death perishes completely.	
 And this knowledge is not introduced as a new thing.  Then what ?
2.40 Moreover, iha, here, in the path to Liberation, viz the Yoga of Action (rites and duties); na, there is no; abhikrama-nasah, waste of an attempt, of a beginning, unlike as in agriculture etc. The meaning is that the result of any attempt in the case of Yoga is not uncertain. Besides, unlike as in medical care, na vidyate, nor is there, nor does there arises; any pratyavayah, harm. But, svalpam api, even a little; asya, of this; dharmasya, righteousness in the form of Yoga (of Action); when pracised, trayate, saves (one); mahato bhayat, from great fear, of mundance existence characterized by death, birth, etc.
2.41 Here, O joy of the Kurus, there is but a single one-pointed determination; many-branched and endless are the thoughts of the irresolute.
2.41 By its means, the straying intellect becomes steadied in the contemplation of one object only; whereas the minds of the irresolute stray into bypaths innumerable.
2.41. O source of joy to the Kurus !   The knowledge in the form of determination is just one;  [but] the knowledge (thoughts) of those who do not have determination, has many branches and has no end.
2.41 In this (Karma Yoga), O Arjuna, the resolute mind is one-pointed; the minds of the irresolute are many-branched and endless.
2.41 O scion of the Kuru dynasty, in this there is a single, one-pointed conviction. The thoughts of the irresolute ones have many branches indeed, and are innumerable.
2.41 Here, i.e., in every ritual sanctioned by the scriptures, the Buddhi or disposition of mind marked by resolution, is single. The Buddhi marked by resolution is the Buddhi concerned with acts which must be performed by one desirous of release (and not any kind of work). The term 'Vyavasaya' menas unshakable conviction:  this Buddhi (disposition of mind) comes out of prior determination about the true nature of the self. But the Buddhi concerning the performance of rituals of fulfill certain desires, is marked by irresolution; because here only this much knowledge of the self is sufficient - 'the self (as an entity) exists differently from the body.' Such a general understanding is sufficient to alify for performing acts giving fulfilment of certain desires. It does not reire any definite knowledge about the true nature of the self. For, even if there is no such knowledge, desires for heaven etc., can arise, the means for their attainment can be adopted, and the experience of those fruits can take place. For this reason there is no contradiction in the teaching of the scriptures. [The contradiction negated here is how can the same scriptural acts produce different results - fulfilment of desires and liberation. The difference in the disposition of the mind accouts of it.]

The Buddhi (mental disposition) marked by resolution has a single aim, because it relates to the attainment of a single fruit. For, as far as one desiring release is concerned, all acts are enjoined only for the accomplishment of that single fruit. Therefore, since the purpose of the scriptures here is one only (i.e., liberation), the Buddhi regarding all rituals taught in the scriptures too is only one, as far as liberation-seekers are concerned. For example, the set of six sacrifices, beginning with Agneya with all their subsidiary processes (though enjoined in different passages) forms the subject of a single injunction, as they are all for the attainment of a single fruit. Conseently the Buddhi concerning these is one only. The meaning of the verse under discussion must be construed in the same manner. But the Buddhi of the irresolute ones who are engaged in rituals for winning such fruits as heaven, sons, cattle, food etc., are endless, frutis being endless. In rituals like Darsapurnamasa (new moon and full moon sacrifice), even though attainment of a single fruit (heaven) is enjoined, there accrues to these the character of having many branches on account of the mention of many secondary fruits as evidenced by such passages as, 'He desires a long life.' Therefore the Buddhi of irresolute ones has many branches and are endless.

The purport is:  In performing obligatory and occasional rituals, all fruits, primary and secondary, promised in the scriptures, should be abandoned, with the idea that release or salvation is the only purpose of all scripture-ordained rituals. These rituals should be performed without any thought of selfish gains. In addition, acts motivated by desires (Kamya-karmas) also should be performed according to one's own capacity, after abandoning all desire for fruits and with the conviction that they also, when performed in that way, form the means for attainment of release. They should be looked upon as eal to obligatory and occasional rites suited to one's own station and stage in life.

Sri Krsna condemns those who perform acts for the attainment of objects of desire:
2.41 Vyavasayatmika etc.  The knowledge in the form of determination is just one and natural in  the case of everyone;  but it suffers manifoldedness according to the objects to be determined.	
 Therefore -
2.41 Kuru-nandana, O scion of the Kuru dynasty; iha, is this path to Liberation; there is only eka, a single; vyavasayatmika, one-pointed; buddhih, conviction, which has been spoken of in the Yoga of Knowledge and which has the characteristics going to be spoken of in (Karma-) yoga. It is resolute by nature and annuls the numerous branches of the other opposite thoughts, since it originates from the right source of knowledge. [The right source of knowledge, viz the Vedic texts, which are above criticism.] Those again, which are the other buddhayah, thoughts; they are bahu-sakhah, possessed of numerous branches, i.e. possessed of numerous variations. Owing to the influence of their many branches the worldly state becomes endless, limitless, unceasing, ever-growing and extensive. [Endless, because it does not cease till the rixe of full enlightenment; limitless, because the worldly state, which is an effect, springs from an unreal source.] But even the worldly state ceases with the cessation of the infinite branches of thoughts, under the influence of discriminating wisdom arising from the valid source of knowledge. (And those thoughts are) hi, indeed; anantah, innumerable under every branch. Whose thoughts? Avyavasayinam, of the irresolute ones, i.e. of those who are devoid of discriminating wisdom arising from the right source of knowledg.
2.42 Flowery speech is uttered by the unwise, taking pleasure in the eulogising words of the Vedas, O Arjuna, saying, "There is nothing else."
2.42 Only the ignorant speak in figurative language. It is they who extol the letter of the scriptures, saying, There is nothing deeper than this.'
2.42. - 2.43. O son of  Prtha !  Those, whose very nature is desire,  whose goal is heaven,  who esteem only the Vedic declaration [of fruits],  who declare that there is nothing else,  who proclaim this flowery speech about the paths to the lordship of the objects of enjoyment-[the paths]  that are full of different actionsand who desire action alone as a fruit of their birth-they are men without insight.
2.42 - 2.44 O! Partha, the unwise, who rejoice in the letter of the Vedas, say, 'There is nothing else.' They are full only of wordly desires and they hanker for heaven. They speak flowery words which offer rirth as the fruit of work. They look upon the Vedas as consisting entirely of varied rites for the attainment of pleasure and power. Those who cling so to pleasure and power are attracted by that speech (offering heavenly rewards) and are unable to develop the resolute will of a concentrated mind.
2.42-2.43  O son of Prtha, those undiscerning people who utter this flowery talk  which promises birth as a result of rites and duties, and is full of various special rites meant for the attainment of enjoyment and affluence , they remain engrossed in the utterances of the Vedas and declare that nothing else exists; their minds are full of desires and they have heaven as the goal.
2.42 - 2.44 The ignorant, whose knowledge is little, and who have as their sole aim the attainment of enjoyment and power, speak the flowery language i.e., having its flowers (show) only as fruits, which look apparently beautiful at first sight. They rejoice in the letter of the Vedas i.e., they are attached to heaven and such other results (promised in the Karma-kanda of the Vedas). They say that there is nothing else, owing to their intense attachment to these results. They say that there is no fruit superior to heaven etc. They are full of worldly desires and their minds are highly attached to secular desires. They hanker for heaven, i.e. think of the enjoyment of the felicities of heaven, after which one can again have rirth which offers again the opportunity to perform varied rites devoid of true knowledge and leads towards the attainment of enjoyments and power once again.

With regard to those who cling to pleasure and power and whose understanding is contaminated by that flowery speech relating to pleasure and lordly powers, the aforesaid mental disposition characterised by resolution, will not arise in their Samadhi. Samadhi here means the mind. The knowledge of the self will not arise in such minds. In the minds of these persons, there cannot arise the mental disposition that looks on all Vedic rituals as means for liberation based on the determined conviction about the real form of the self. Hence, in an aspirant for liberation, there should be no attachment to rituals out of the conviction that they are meant for the acisition of objects of desire only.

It may be estioned why the Vedas, which have more of love for Jivas than thousands of parents, and which are endeavouring to save the Jivas, should prescribe in this way rites whose fruits are infinitesimal and which produce only new births. It can also be asked if it is proper to abandon what is given in the Vedas. Sri Krsna replies to these estions.
2.42 See Comment under 2.44
2.42 Partha, O son of Prtha; those devoid of one-pointed conviction, who pravadanti, utter; imam, this; yam puspitam vacam, flowery talk, which is going to be stated, which is beautiful like a tree in bloom, pleasant to hear, and appears to be (meaningful) sentences [Sentences that can be called really meaningful are only those that reveal the self.-Tr.];  who are they? they are  avipascitah, people who are undiscerning, of poor intellect, i.e. non-discriminating; veda-vada-ratah, who remain engrossed in the utterances of the Vedas, in the Vedic sentences which reveal many panegyrics, fruits of action and their means; and vadinah, who declare, are apt tosay; iti, that; na anyat, nothing else [God, Liberation, etc.]; asti, exists, apart from the rites and duties conducive to such results as attainment of heaven etc.
And they are kamatmanah, have their minds full of desires, i.e. they are swayed by desires, they are, by nature, full of desires; (and) svarga-parah, have heaven as the goal. Those who accept heaven (svarga) as the supreme (para) human goal, to whom heaven is the highest, are svarga-parah. They utter that speech ( this is supplied to construct the sentence ) which janma-karma-phala-pradam, promises birth as a result of rites and duties. The result (phala) of rites and duties (karma) is karma-phala. Birth (janma) itself is the karma-phala. That (speech) which promises this is janma-karma-phala-prada. (This speech) is kriya-visesa-bahulam, full of various special rites; bhoga-aisvarya-gatim-prati, for the attainment of enjoyment and affluence. Special (visesa) rites (kriya) are kriya-visesah. The speech that is full (bahula) of these, the speech by which that is full (bahula) of these, the speech by which these, viz objects such as heaven, animals and sons, are revealed plentifully, is kriya-visesa-bahula. Bhoga, enjoyment, and aisvarya, affluence, are bhoga-aisvarya. Their attainment (gatih) is bhoga-aisvarya-gatih. (They utter a speech) that is full of the specialized rites, prati, meant for that (attainment). The fools who utter that speech move in the cycle of transmigration. This is the idea.
2.43 Full of desires, having heaven as their goal, (they utter speech which is directed to ends) leading to new births as the result of their works, and prescribe various methods abounding in specific actions, for the attainment of pleasure and power.
2.43 Consulting only their own desires, they construct their own heaven, devising arduous and complex rites to secure their own pleasure and their own power; and the only result is rebirth.

2.42-44 Yam imam etc., upto na vidhiyate.  Those, who crave for objects of desire, speak, on their own  accord, of  this flowery Vedic speech which is pervaded by the fruits i.e., the heaven in the future; and who, hence, desire the action itself as the fruit of their birth - these are men without insight.  further, having their mind carried away by the same Vedic sentence imagined by themselves, these persons, eventhough they are endowed with the determinate knowledge, are not fit for concentration, because they do not decide this (concentration) as a fruit [of their action].  This is the purport of the traid of these verses.
2.44 And vyavasayatmika, one-pointed; buddhih, conviction, with regard to Knowledge or Yoga; na vidhiyate, does not become established, i.e. does not arise; samadhau, in the minds  the word samadhi being derived in the sese of that into which everthing is gathered together for the enjoyment of a person ; bhoga-aisvarya-prasaktanam, of those who delight in enjoyment and wealth, of those who have the hankering that only enjoyment as also wealth is to be sought for, of those who identify themselves with these; and apahrta-cetasam, of those whose intellects are carried away, whose discriminating judgement becomes covered; taya, by that speech which is full of various special rites.
2.45 The Vedas deal with the three attributes (of Nature); be thou above these three attributes. O Arjuna, free yourself from the pairs of opposites, and ever remain in the ality of Sattva (goodness), freed from (the thought of) acisition and preservation, and be established in the Self.
2.45 The Vedic Scriptures tell of the three constituents of life - the Qualities. Rise above all of them, O Arjuna, above all the pairs of opposing sensations; be steady in truth, free from worldly anxieties and centered in the Self.
2.45. The Vedas bind by means of the three Strands.  [Hence]  O Arjuna,  you must be free from the three Strands,  free from the pairs [of opposites];  be established in this eternal Being;  be free from [the idea of]  acisition and preservation; and be possessed of the Self.
2.45 The Vedas have the three Gunas for their sphere, O Arjuna. You must be free from the three Gunas and be free from the pairs of opposites. Abide in pure Sattva; never care to acire things and to protect what has been acired, but be established in the self.
2.45 O Arjuna, the Vedas [Meaning only the portion dealing with rites and duties (karma-kanda).] have the three alities as their object. You become free from worldliness, free from the pairs of duality, ever-poised in the ality of sattva, without (desire for) acisition and protection, and self-collected.
2.45 The word Traigunya means the three Gunas - Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Here the term Traigunya denotes persons in whom Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are in abundance. The Vedas in prescribing desire-oriented rituals (Kamya-karmas) have such persons in view. Because of their great love, the Vedas teach what is good to those in whom Tamas, Rajas and Sattva preponderate. If the Vedas had not explained to these persons the means for the attainment of heaven etc., according to the Gunas, then those persons who are not interested in liberation owing to absence of Sattva and preponderance of Rajas and Tamas in them, would get completely lost amidst what should not be resorted to, without knowing the means for attaining the results they desire. Hence the Vedas are concerned with the Gunas. Be you free from the three Gunas. Try to acire Sattva in abundance; increase that alone. The purport is:  do not nurse the preponderance of the three Gunas in their state of inter-mixture; do not cultivate such preponderance.

Be free from the pairs of opposites; be free from all the characteristics of worldly life. Abide in pure Sattva; be established in Sattva, in its state of purity without the admixture of the other two Gunas. If it is estioned how that is possible, the reply is as follows. Never care to acire things nor protect what has been acired. While abandoning the acisition of what is not reired for self-realisation, abandon also the conservation of such things already acired. You can thus be established in self-control and thery become an aspirant after the essentail nature of the self. 'Yoga' is acisition of what has not been acired; 'Ksema' is preservation of things already acired. Abandoning these is a must for an aspirant after the essential nature of the self. If you conduct yourself in this way, the preponderance of Rajas and Tamas will be annihilated, and pure Sattva will develop.

Besides, all that is taught in the Vedas is not fit to be utilised by all.
2.45 Traigunya-etc.  The Vedas bind  very much [only] by means of the three Strands and they do not bind on their own accord.  For, the rituals prescribed in the Vedas, create bondage if they are performed with an intention of pleasure, or of (avoiding) pain, or with an illlusion of attachment.  Hence the traid of Strands in the form of desire (or in a pleasing form) must be abandoned.
 
If the present passage were intended to condemn the Vedas, then the act of fighting the battle in estion would be spoiled, because there is nothing other than the Vedas do not bind those, from whom the desire for fruit has completely gone.	
 Because the Vedas alone are useful for proper knowledge in the case of those persons [free from the Strands] hence [the Lord] says-
2.45 To those who are thus devoid of discriminating wisdom, who indulge in pleasure, [Here Ast. adds 'yat phalam tad aha, what result accrues, that the Lord states:'-Tr.] O Arjuna, vedah, the Vedas; traigunya-visayah, have the three alities as their object, have the three gunas, [Traigunya means the collection of the three alities, viz sattva (purity), rajas (energy) and tamas (darkness); i.e. the collection of virtuous, vicious and mixed activities, as also their results. In this derivative sense traigunya means the worldly life.] i.e. the worldly life, as the object to be revealed. But you bhava, become; nistraigunyah, free from the three alities, i.e. be free from desires. [There is a seeming conflict between the advices to be free from the three alities and to be ever-poised in the ality of sattva. Hence, the Commentator takes the phrase nistraigunya to mean niskama, free from desires.] (Be) nirdvandvah, free from the pairs of duality  by the word dvandva, duality, are meant the conflicting pairs [Of heat and cold, etc.] which are the causes of happiness and sorrow; you become free from them. [From heat, cold, etc. That is, forbear them.]
You become nitya-sattvasthah, ever-poised in the ality of sattva; (and) so also niryoga-ksemah, without (desire for) acisition and protection. Yoga means acisition of what one has not, and ksema means the protection of what one has. For one who as 'acisition and protection' foremost in his mind, it is difficult to seek Liberation. Hence, you be free from acisition and protection. And also be atmavan, self-collected, vigilant. This is the advice given to you while you are engaged in your own duty. [And not from the point of view of seeking Liberation.]
2.46 To the Brahmana who has known the Self, all the Vedas are of as much use as is a reservoir of water in a place where there is a flood.
2.46 As a man can drink water from any side of a full tank, so the skilled theologian can wrest from any scripture that which will serve his purpose.
2.46. What portion in a reservoir,  flooded with water everywhere, is useful [for a man in thirst],  that much portion [alone]  in all the Vedas is useful for an intelligent student of the Vedas.
2.46 What use a thirsty person has for a water reservoir when all sides of it are flooded - that much alone is the use of all the Vedas for a Brahmana who knows.
2.46 A Brahmana with realization has that much utility in all the Vedas as a man has in a well when there is a flood all around.
2.46 Whatever use, a thirsty person has for a reservoir, which is flooded with water on all sides and which has been constructed for all kinds of purposes like irrigation, only to that extent of it, i.e., enough to drink will be of use to the thirsty person and not all the water. Likewise, whatever in all the Vedas from the means for release to a knowing Brahmana, i.e., one who is established in the study of the Vedas and who aspires for release only to that extent is it to be accepted by him and not anything else.

Sri Krsna now says that this much alone is to be accepted by an aspirant, established in Sattva:
2.46 Yavan etc. He, according to whom the importance lies in his own duty alone or in the knowledge - for him the purpose is served even from a limited portion of the Vedic teaching	
 Therefore-
2.46 If there be no need for the infinite results of all the rites and duties mentioned in the Vedas, then why should they be performed as a dedication to God? Listen to the answer being given:
In the world, yavan, whatever; arthah, utility, use, like bathing, drinking, etc.; one has udapane, in a well, pond and other numerous limited reservoirs; all that, indeed, is achieved, i.e. all those needs are fulfilled to that very extent; sampluhtodake, when there is a flood; sarvatah, all arount. In a similar manner, whatever utility, result of action, there is sarvesu, in all; the vedesu, Vedas, i.e. in the rites and duties mentioned in the Vedas; all that utility is achieved, i.e. gets fulfilled; tavan, to that very extent; in that result of realization which comes brahmanasya, to a Brahmana, a sannyasin; vijanatah, who knows the Reality that is the supreme Goal  that result being comparable to the flood all around. For there is the Upanisadic text, '৷৷.so all virtuous deeds performed by people get included in this one৷৷.who knows what he (Raikva) knows৷৷.' (Ch. 4.1.4). The Lord also will say, 'all actions in their totality culminate in Knowledge' (4.33). [The Commentators otation from the Ch. relates to meditation on the alified Brahman. Lest it be concluded that the present verse relates to knowledge of the alified Brahman only, he otes again from the Gita toshow that the conclusion holds good in the case of knowledge of the absolute Brahman as well.]
Therefore, before one attains the fitness for steadfastness in Knowledge, rites and duties, even though they have (limited) utility as that of a well, pond, etc., have to be undertaken by one who is fit for rites and duties.
2.47 Thy right is to work only, but never with its fruits; let not the fruits of action be thy motive, nor let thy attachment be to inaction.
2.47 But thou hast only the right to work, but none to the fruit thereof. Let not then the fruit of thy action be thy motive; nor yet be thou enamored of inaction.
2.47. Let your claim lie on action alone and never on the fruits;  you should never be a cause for the fruits of action; let not your attachment be to inaction.
2.47 To work alone you have the right, and not to the fruits. Do not be impelled by the fruits of work. Nor have attachment to inaction.
2.47 Your right is for action alone, never for the results. Do not become the agent of the results of action. May you not have any inclination for inaction.
2.47 As for obligatory, occasional and desiderative acts taught in the Vedas and associated with some result or other, you, an aspirant established in Sattva, have the right only to perform them:  You have no right to the fruits known to be derived from such acts. Acts done with a desire for fruit bring about bondage. But acts done without an eye on fruits form My worship and become a means for release. Do not become an agent of acts with the idea of being the reaper of their fruits. Even when you, who are established in pure Sattva and are desrious of release, perform acts, you should not look upon yourself as the agent. Likewise, it is necessary to contemplate yourself as not being the cause of even appeasing hunger and such other bodily necessities. Later on it will be said that both of these, agency of action and desire for fruits, should be considered as belonging to Gunas, or in the alternative to Me who am the Lord of all. Thinking thus, do work. With regard to inaction, i.e., abstaining from performance of duties, as when you said, 'I will not fight,' let there be no attachment to such inaction in you. The meaning is let your interest be only in the discharge of such obligatory duties like this war in the manner described above.

Sri Krsna makes this clear in the following verse:
2.47 Karmani etc.  You should be concerned in the action alone, but not in the fruits of actions.  But, if an action has been performed, then will not its fruit just inevitably befall  [to the performer] ?  No.  It is not so.  For, in that case, if you are covered with the dirt of desire for fruits, then you become a cuase for the fruit of action.  What is prayed for is known to be the fruit; and it does not befall him who does not desire it.  Thus, what attachment a person entertains with regard to the negation of action,  that alone is like a firm seizure, and is of the nature of false conception, and hence it must be abandoned.	
 Then what ?-
2.47 Te, your; adhikarah, right; is karmani eva, for action alone, not for steadfastness in Knowledge. Even there, when you are engaged in action, you have ma kadacana, never, i.e. under no condition whatever; a right phalesu, for the results of action  may you not have a hankering for the results of action. Whenever you have a hankering for the fruits of action, you will become the agent of aciring the results of action. Ma, do not; thus bhuh, become; karma-phalahetuh, the agent of aciring the results of action. For when one engages in action by being impelled by thirst for the results of action, then he does become the cause for the production of the results of action. Ma, may you not; astu, have; sangah, an inclination; akarmani, for inaction, thinking, 'If the results of work be not desired, what is the need of work which involves pain?'
2.48 Perform action, O Arjuna, being steadfast in Yoga, abandoning attachment and balanced in success and failure. Evenness of mind is called Yoga.
2.48 Perform all thy actions with mind concentrated on the Divine, renouncing attachment and looking upon success and failure with an equal eye. Spirituality implies equanimity.
2.48. O Dhananjaya !  Established in the Yoga, perform actions, abandoning attachment, remaining even-minded in success and failure; for, the even-mindedness is said to be the Yoga.
2.48 Abandoning attachment and established in Yoga, perfom works, viewing success and failure with an even mind. Evenness of mind is said to be Yoga.
2.48  By being established in Yoga, O Dhananjaya (Arjuna), undertake actions, casting off attachment and remaining eipoised in success and failure. Eanimity is called Yoga.
2.48 Abandoning the attachment to kingdom, relatives etc., and established in Yoga, engage in war and such other activities. Perform these with eanimity as regards success and failure resulting from victory etc., which are inherent in them. This eanimity with regard to success and failure is called here by the term Yoga, in the expression 'established in Yoga.' Yoga is eanimity of mind which takes the form of evenness in success and failure.

Sri Krsna explains why this is repeatedly said:
2.48 Yogasthah etc.  Being established in Yoga you must perform actions.  Evenness [of mind] is the Yoga.
2.48 If action is not to be undertaken by one who is under the impulsion of the fruits of action, how then are they to be undertaken? This is being stated: Yogasthah, by becoming established in Yoga; O Dhanajaya, kuru, undertake; karmani, actions, for the sake of God alone; even there, tyaktva, casting off; sangam, attachment, in the form, 'God will be pleased with me.' ['Undertake work for pleasing God, but not for propitiating Him to become favourable towards yourself.']
Undertake actions bhutva, remaining; samah, eipoised; siddhi-asidhyoh, in success and failure  even in the success characterized by the attainment of Knowledge that arises from the purification of the mind when one performs actions without hankering for the results, and in the failure that arises from its opposite. [Ignorance, arising from the impurity of the mind.] What is that Yoga with regard to being established in which it is said, 'undertake'? This indeed is that: the samatvam, eanimity in success and failure; ucyate, is called; yogah, Yoga.
2.49 Far lower than the Yoga of wisdon is action, O Arjuna. Seek thou refuge in wisdom; wretched are they whose motive is the fruit.
2.49 Physical action is far inferior to an intellect concentrated on the Divine. Have recourse then to Pure Intelligence. It is only the petty-minded who work for reward.
2.49. O Dhananjaya !  The inferior action stays away at a distance due to Yoga of (one's contact with)  determining faculty;  in the determining faculty you must seek refuge; wretched are those who constitute the causes for the fruits of action.
2.49 Action with attachment is far inferior, O Arjuna, to action done with evenness of mind. Seek refuge in evenness of mind. Miserable are they who act with a motive for results.
2.49 O Dhananjaya, indeed, action is ite inferior to the yoga of wisdom. Take resort to wisdom. Those who thirst for rewards are pitiable.
2.49 All other kinds of action are far inferior to those done with evenness of mind, which consists in the renunciation of the main result and with eanimity towards success or failure in  respect of the secondary results. Between the two kinds of actions, the one with eanimity and the other with attachment, the former associated with eanimity removes all the sufferings of Samsara and leads to release which is the highest object of human existence. The latter type of actions, which is pursued with an eye on results, leads one to Samsara whose character is endless suffering. Thus when an act is being done, take refuge in Buddhi (evenness of mind). Refuge means abode. Live in that Buddhi, is the meaning. 'Miserable are they who act with a motive for results':  it means, 'Those who act with attachment to the results, etc., are miserable, as they will continue in Samsara.'
2.49 Durena etc. Due to the contact  (one has) with determining faculty  [one's]  inferior action i.e.,  the action that bears bad fruits and is empty, remains far away [from him].  Therefore seek i.e., pray for a refuge in the determining faculty of that nature, on account of which that determining faculty is gained.
2.49 Then again, O Dhananjaya, as against action performed with eanimity of mind for adoring God, karma, action undertaken by one longing for the results; is, hi, indeed; durena, ite, by far; avaram, inferior, very remote; buddhi-yogat, from the yoga of wisdom, from actions undertaken with eanimity of mind, because it (the former) is the cause of birth, death, etc. Since this is so, therefore, saranam anviccha, take resort to, seek shelter; buddhau, under wisdom, which relates to Yoga, or to the Conviction about Reality that arises from its (the former's) maturity and which is the cause of (achieving) fearlessness. The meaning is that you should resort to the knowledge of the supreme Goal, because those who under take inferior actions, phala-hetavah, who thirst for rewards, who are impelled by results; are krpanah, pitiable, according to the Sruti, 'He, O Gargi, who departs from this world without knowing this Immutable, is pitiable' (Br. 3.8.10). [See note under 2.7.-Tr.]
2.5 Better it is, indeed, in this world to accept alms than to slay the most noble teachers. But if I kill them, even in this world all my enjoyments of wealth and fulfilled desires will be stained with (their) blood.
2.5 Rather would I content myself with a beggar's crust that kill these teachers of mine, these precious noble souls! To slay these masters who are my benefactors would be to stain the sweetness of life's pleasures with their blood.
2.5. It is good indeed even to go about begging in this world without killing the elders of great dignity;  but with greed for wealth,  I would not enjoy,  by killing my elders,  the blood-stained objects of pleasures.
2.5 It is better even to live on a beggar's fare in this world than to slay these most venerable teachers. If I should slay my teachers, though degraded they be by desire for wealth, I would be enjoying only blood-stained pleasures here.
2.5  Rather than killing the noble-minded elders, it is better in this world to live even on alms. But by killing the elders we shall only be enjoying here the pleasures of wealth and desireable things drenched in blood.
2.4 - 2.5 Arjuna said  Again Arjuna, being moved by love, compassion and fear, mistaking unrighteousness for righteousness, and not understanding, i.e., not knowing the beneficial words of Sri Krsna, said as follows:  'How can I slay Bhisma, Drona and others worthy or reverence?  After slaying those elders, though they are intensely attached to enjoyments, how can I enjoy those very pleasures which are now being enjoyed by them?  For, it will be mixed with  their blood.
2.5 See Comment under 2.6
2.50 Endowed with wisdom (evenness of mind), one casts off in this life both good and evil deeds; therefore, devote thyself to Yoga; Yoga is skill in action.
2.50 When a man attains to Pure Reason, he renounces in this world the results of good and evil alike. Cling thou to Right Action. Spirituality is the real art of living.
2.50. Whosoever is endowed with determining faculty-he casts off both of these viz., the good action and the bad action.  Therefore strive for Yoga; Yoga is proficiency is action.
2.50 A man with evenness of mind discards here and now good and evil. Therefore endeavour for Yoga. Yoga is skill in action.
2.50 Possessed of wisdom, one rejects here both virtue and vice. Therefore devote yourself to (Karma-) yoga. Yoga is skilfulness in action.
2.50 He, who is established in evenness of mind in the performance of actions, relinishes good and evil Karmas which have accumulated from time immemorial causing bondage endlessly. Therefore acire this aforesaid evenness of mind (Buddhi Yoga). Yoga is skill in action. That is, this evenness of mind when one is engaged in action, is possible through great skill, i.e., ability.
2.50 Buddhiyuktah etc.  Both indicates the mutual exclusion  [of the good and bad actions].  Therefore [strive] for Yoga etc. : Working in that manner alone constitutes the supreme proficiency, by [working] in which manner the good action and the bad action perish.  This is the idea here.
2.50 Listen to the result that one possessed of the wisdom of eanimity attains by performing one's own duties: Buddhi-yuktah, possessed of wisdom, possessed of the wisdom of eanimity; since one jahati, rejects; iha, here, in this world; ubhe, both; sukrta-duskrte, virtue and vice (righteousness and unrighteousness), through the purification of the mind and acisition of Knowledge; tasmat, therefore; yujyasva, devote yourself; yogaya, to (Karma-) yoga, the wisdom of eanimity. For Yoga is kausalam, skilfulness; karmasu, in action. Skilfulness means the attitude of the skilful, the wisdom of eanimity with regard to one's success and failure while engaged in actions (karma)  called one's own duties (sva-dharma)  with the mind dedicated to God.
That indeed is skilfulness which, through eanimity, makes actions that by their very nature bind give up their nature! Therefore, be you devoted to the wisdom of eanimity.
2.51 The wise, possessed of knowledge, having abandoned the fruits of their actions, and being freed from the fetters of birth, go to the place which is beyond all evil.
2.51 The sages guided by Pure Intellect renounce the fruit of action; and, freed from the chains of rebirth, they reach the highest bliss.
2.51. By renouncing the fruit, born of action, the intelligent ones endowed with determining faculty and freed from the bond of birth,  go to the place that is devoid of illness.
2.51 The wise who possess evenness of mind, relinishing the fruits born of action, are freed from the bondage of birth, and go to the region beyond all ills.
2.51 Because, those who are devoted to wisdom, (they) becoming men of Enlightenment by giving up the fruits produced by actions, reach the state beyond evils by having become freed from the bondage of birth.
2.51 Those who possess this evenness of mind while performing actions and relinish their fruits, are freed from the bondage of rirth, and go to the region beyond all ills. 'Hi' means that this dictum or teaching is well known in all the Upanisads.
2.51 Karmajam etc.  The persons who are endowed with the determining faculty with regard to the Yoga,  renounce the birth-bondage, by renouncing the fruit of actions; and they attain the Brahman-existence.
2.51 The words 'phalam tyaktva, by giving up the fruits' are connected with the remote word 'karmajam, produced by actions'.
Hi, because; [Because, when actions are performed with an attitude of eanimity, it leads to becoming freed from sin etc. Therefore, by stages, it becomes the cause of Liberation as well.] buddhi-yuktah, those who are devoted to wisdom, who are imbued with the wisdom of eanimity; (they) becoming manisinah, men of Enlightenment; tyaktva, by giving up; phalam, the fruit, the acisition of desirable and undesriable bodies; [Desirable: the bodies of gods and others; undesirable: the bodies of animals etc.] karmajam, produced by actions; gacchanti, reach; padam, the state, the supreme state of Visnu, called Liberation; anamayam, beyond evils, i.e. beyond all evils; by having become janma-bandha-vinirmuktah, freed from the bondage of birth  birth (janma) itself is a bondage (bandha); becoming freed from that , even while living.
Or:  Since it (buddhi) has been mentioned as the direct cause of the elimination of righteousness and unrighteousness, and so on, therefore what has been presented (in the three verses) beginning with, 'O Dhananjaya,৷৷.to the yoga of wisdom' (49), is enlightenment itself, which consists in the realization of the supreme Goal, which is comparable to a flood all around, and which arises from the purification of the mind as a result of Karma-yoga. [In the first portion of the Commentary buddhi has been taken to mean samattva buddhi (wisdom of eanimity); the alternative meaning of buddhi has been taken as 'enlightenment'. So, action is to be performed by taking the help of the 'wisdom about the supreme Reality' which has been chosen as one's Goal.]
2.52 When thy intellect crosses beyond the mire of delusion, then thou shalt attain to indifference as to what has been heard and what has yet to be heard.
2.52 When thy reason has crossed the entanglements of illusion, then shalt thou become indifferent both to the philosophies thou hast heard and to those thou mayest yet hear.
2.52. When your determining faculty goes beyond the impregnable thicket of delusion, at that time you will attain an attitude of futility regarding what has to be heard and what has been heard.
2.52 When your intellect has passed beyond the tangle of delusion, you will yourself feel disgusted regarding what you shall hear and what you have already heard.
2.52 When your mind will go beyond the turbidity of delusion, then you will acire dispassion for what has to be heard and what has been heard.
2.52 If you act in this manner and get freed from impurities, your intellect will pass beyond the tangle of delusion. The dense impurity of sin is the nature of that delusion which generates attachment to infinitesimal results, of which you have already heard much from us and will hear more later on. You will then immediately feel, of your own accord, renunciation or feeling of disgust for them all.

Sri Krsna now teaches the goal called self-realisation (Yoga) which results from the performance of duty as taught in the passage beginning with 'Now, listen to this with regard to Karma Yoga' (2.39) which is based on the knowledge of the real nature of the self gained through the refinement of the mind.
2.52 See Comment under 2.53
2.52 When is attained that wisdom which arises from the purification of the mind brought about by the pursuit of (karma-) yoga? This is being stated: Yada, when, [Yada: when maturity of discrimination is attained.] at the time when; te, your; buddhih, mind; vyatitarisyati, will go beyond, cross over; moha-kalilam, the turbidity of delusion, the dirt in the form of delusion, in the form of non-discrimination, which, after confounding one's understanding about the distinction between the Self and the not-Self, impels the mind towards objects  that is to say, when your mind will attain the state of purity; tada, then, [Tada: then, when the mind, becoming purified, leads to the rise of discrimination, which in turn matures into detachment.] at that time; gantasi, you will acire; nirvedam, despassion; for srotavyasya, what has to be heard; ca, and; srutasya, what has been heard. The idea implied is that, at that time what has to be heard and what has been heard [What has to be heard৷৷.has been heard, i.e. the scriptures other than those relating to Self-knowledge. When discrimination referred to above gets matured, then the fruitlessness of all things other than Self-knowledge becomes apparent.] becomes fruitless.
2.53 When thy intellect, which is perplexed by the Veda text, which thou hast read, shall stand immovable and steady in the Self, then thou shalt attain Self-realisation.
2.53 When the intellect, bewildered by the multiplicity of holy scripts, stands unperturbed in blissful contemplation of the Infinite, then hast thou attained Spirituality.
2.53. When your determining faculty,  that had been [earlier] confused by your hearing [of scriptural declaration of fruits]  shall stand stable in concentration, at that time you shall attain the Yoga.
2.53 When your intellect, well enlightened by hearing from Me and firmly placed, stands unshaken in a concentrated mind, then you will attain the vision of the self.
2.53 When your mind that has become bewildered by hearing [S. takes the word sruti in the sense of the Vedas.-Tr.] will become unshakable and steadfast in the Self, then you will attain Yoga that arises from discrimination.
2.53 Here 'Sruti' means hearing (and not the Veda). When your intellect, which, by hearing from us, has become specially enlightened, having for its object the eternal, unsurpassed and subtle self - which belongs to a class different from all other entities -, then the intellect is firmly fixed, i.e., in a single psychosis and stands unshaken. In such a concentrated mind, purified by the performance of duties without attachment, will be generated true Yoga, which consists in the vision of the self. What is said is this:  Karma Yoga, which presupposes the knowledge of the real nature of the self obtained from the scriptures, leads to a firm devotion to knowledge known as the state of firm wisdom; and the state of 'firm wisdom;' which is in the form of devotion to knowledge, generates the vision of the self; this vision is here called Yoga.

Arjuna, thus taught, estions about the nature of 'firm wisdom' which constitutes the means for the attainment of Yoga and which itself is attainable through Karma Yoga which consists in work with detachment, and also about the mode of behaviour of a man of 'firm wisdom.'
2.52-53 Yada te etc.  Sruti-etc.  At the time, when the determining facult with regard to the Yoga is attained, the clear sign of recognizing it, is this :  An attitude of futility about the revealed literature that has to be listened to, that has been listened to and that is being declared.  What has been declared by the above is this :  'This present view of yours about the ruination of your race is out of place and it is due to the influence of your deceptive notion, born of mental impressions created by your listening to the teachings of those scriptures that favour the observers who are fallen deep into the course of ignorance.  But, that view shall vanish when the respect for such a teaching disappears.
2.53 If it be asked, 'By becoming possessed of the wisdom arising from the discrimination about the Self after overcoming the turbidity of delusion, when shall I attain the yoga of the supreme Reality which is the fruit that results from Karma-yoga?', then listen to that; Yada, when at the time when; te, your; buddhih, mind; that has become sruti-vi-pratipanna, bewildered, tossed about, by hearing (the Vedas) that reveal the diverse ends, means, and (their) relationship, i.e. are filled with divergent ideas; sthasyati, will become; niscala, unshakable, free from the trubulence in the form of distractions; and acala, steadfast, that is to say, free from doubt even in that (unshakable) state; samadhau, in samadhi, that is to say, in the Self  samadhi being derived in the sense of that in which the mind is fixed; tada, then, at that time; avapsyasi, you will attain; yogam, Yoga, the enlightenment, Self-absorption, that arises from discrimination.
Having got an occasion for iniry, Arjuna, with a view to knowing the characteristics of one who has the realization of the Self, [By the word samadhi is meant the enlightenment arising from discrimination, which has been spoken of in the commentary on the previous verse. The steadfastness which the monks have in that enlightenment is called steadfastness in Knowledge. Or the phrase may mean, 'the enlightenment achieved through meditation on the Self', i.e. the realization of the supreme Goal.] asked:
2.54 Arjuna said  What, O Krishna, is the description of him who has steady wisdom, and is merged in the superconscious state? How does one of steady wisdom speak, how does he sit, how does he walk?
2.54 Arjuna asked: My Lord! How can we recognise the saint who has attained Pure Intellect, who has reached this state of Bliss, and whose mind is steady? how does he talk, how does he live, and how does he act?
2.54. Arjuna said  O Kesava !  What is the connotation of sthita-prajna (a man-of-stabilized-intellect),  [applied] to a man fixed in concentration ?  What would sthira-dhih (the fixed-minded) convey ?  Where would the fixed-minded abide ?  And what would be reach ?
2.54 Arjuna said  What is the mode of speech of him who is of firm wisdom, who is established in the control of the mind?  What will a man of firm wisdom speaks, O Krsna?  How does he sit?  How does he move?
2.54 Arjuna said  O kesava, what is the description of a man of steady wisdom who is Self-absorbed? How does the man of steady wisdom speak? How does he sit? How does he move about?
2.54 Arjuna said  What is the speech  of a man of firm wisdom who is abiding with the mind controlled?  What words can describe his state?  What is his nature?  This is the meaning of 'How does a man of firm wisdom speak etc.?'

His specific conduct is now described as his nature can be inferred therefrom.
2.54 Sthita-prajnasya etc.  By the statement  'When the determing faculty shall stand [firm in concentration, at that time you shall attain Yoga - above II, 55]'  it has been [virtually] stated there that the appellation sthita-prajna (man-of-stabilized-intellect) is a nomenclature signifying man-of-Yoga who is fixed in concentration.   Now, what is the  connotation of it, i.e., what is the basis for the usage of this nomenclature ?  For, [connotation is that] basing on which a particular meaning is connoted by words.  Does the appellation sthita-prajna of the man-of-Yoga speak of him through its traditional (or conventional) force of the word or through its force of etymology ?  This is the first estion. Of course, regarding the traditional force of the word there is no doubt at all.  [For, it has no such force in it].  Yet, the present estion is to make the etymological meaning-though it is already available-clear by explaining the basis for definition of special nature.
 
The expression sthira-dhih has for its imports both the expression [itself] and its meaning  'the fixed-minded'.  Of  them, does the expression sthira-dhih denote that meaning alone which is indicated by the force of its components; or else does it denote the ascetic also ?  This is the second estion.
 
Again, where would that firm-minded man-of-Yoga abide i.e., what would he practise; or what would his firmness depend on ?  This is the third [estion].
 
And what world he achieve by practising ?  This is the fourth  [estion].
 
These four estions are decided one by one by the Bhagavat [in the seel].
2.54 O Kesava, ka, what; is the bhasa, description, the language (for the description)   how is he described by others ; sthita-prajnasya, of a man of steady wisdom, of one whose realization, 'I am the supreme Brahman', remains steady; samadhi-sthasya, of one who is Self-absorbed? Or kim, how; does the sthitadhih, dhih, man of steady wisdom; himself probhaseta, speak? How does he asita, sit? How does he vrajeta, move about? That is to say, of what kind is his sitting or moving?
Through this verse Arjuna asks for a description of the man of steady wisdom.
2.55 The Blessed Lord said  When a man completely casts off, O Arjuna, all the desires of the mind and is satisfied in the Self by the Self, then is he said to be one of steady wisdom.
2.55 Lord Shri Krishna replied: When a man has given up the desires of his heart and is satisfied with the Self alone, be sure that he has reached the highest state.
2.55. The Bhagavat said  O son of Prtha !  When a man casts off all desires existing in his mind and remains content in the Self by the self (mind),  then he is called 'a man-of-stabilized-intellect.
2.55 The Lord said   When a man renounces all the desires of the mind, O Arjuna, when he is satisfied in himself with himself, then he is said to be of firm wisdom.
2.55  The Blessed said  O Partha, when one fully renounces all the desires that have entered the mind, and remains satisfied in the Self alone by the Self, then he is called a man of steady wisdom.
2.55 The Lord said  When a person is satisfied in himself with himself, i.e. when his mind depends on the self within himself; and being content with that, expels all the desires of the mind which are different from that state of mind - then he is said to be a man of firm wisdom. This is the highest form of devotion of knowledge.

Then, the lower state, not far below it, of one established in firm wisdom, is described:
2.55 Prajahati etc.  [The expression  'a man-of-stabilized-intellect' denotes] a  man whose intellect has stabilized, i.e., has grown roots.  Growing roots is growing roots permanently  on the Self.  For, if that is achieved, the agitation in the form of desire born of the distraction by sense-objects comes to an end.  Therefore, the nomenclature  'a man-of-stabilized-intellect' applied to a man-of-Yoga, has an etymological sense and it is appropriate in this way.  In this manner one estion has been answered.
2.55 In the verses beginning from, 'When one fully renounces৷৷.', and ending with the completion the Chapter, instruction about the characteristics of the man of steady wisdom and the disciplines (he had to pass through) is being given both for the one who has, indeed, applied himself to steadfastness in the Yoga of Knowledge after having renounced rites and duties from the very beginning [Even while he is in the stage of celibacy.], and for the one who has (applied himself to this after having passed) through the path of Karma-yoga. For in all the scriptures without exception, dealing, with spirituality, whatever are the characteristics of the man of realization are themselves presented as the disciplines for an aspirant, because these (characteristics) are the result of effort. And those that are the disciplines reiring effort, they become the characteristics (of the man of realization). [There are two kinds of sannyasa  vidvat (renunciation that naturally follows Realization), and vividisa, formal renunciation for undertaking the disciplines which lead to that Realization. According to A.G. the characteristics presented in this and the following verses describe not only the vidvat-sannyasin, but are also meant as disciplines for the vividisa-sannyasin.-Tr.]
O Partha, yada, when, at the time when; prajahati, one fully renounces; sarvan, all; the kaman, desires, varieties of desires; manogatan, that have entered the mind, entered into the heart .
If all desires are renounced while the need for maintaining the body persists, then, in the absence of anything to bring satisfaction, there may arise the possibility of one's behaving like lunatics or drunkards. [A lunatic is one who has lost his power of discrimination, and a drunkard is one who has that power but ignores it.] Hence it is said: Tustah, remains satisfied; atmani eva, in the Self alone, in the very nature of the inmost Self; atmana, by the Self which is his own  indifferent to external gains, and satiated with everything else on account of having attained the nector of realization of the supreme Goal; tada, then; ucyate, he is called; sthita-prajnah, a man of steady wisdom, a man of realization, one whose wisdom, arising from the discrimination between the Self and the not-Self, is stable.
The idea is that the man of steady wisdom is a monk, who has renounced the desire for progeny, wealth and the worlds, and who delights in the Self and disports in the Self.
2.56 He whose mind is not shaken by adversity, who does not hanker after pleasures, and is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady wisdom.
2.56 The sage, whose mind is unruffled in suffering, whose desire is not roused by enjoyment, who is without attachment, anger or fear - take him to be one who stands at that lofty level.
2.56. He,  whose mind is undisturbed in the midst of sorrows;  who is free from desire in the midst of pleasures; and from whom longing, fear and wrath have totally gone-he is said to be a firm-minded sage.
2.56 He whose mind is not perturbed in pain, who has no longing for pleasures, who is free from desire, fear and anger - he is called a sage of firm wisdom.
2.56 That monk is called a man of steady wisdom when his mind is unperturbed in sorrow, he is free from longing for delights, and has gone beyond attachment, fear and anger.
2.56 Even when there are reasons for grief like separation from beloved ones, his mind is not perturbed, i.e., he is not aggrieved. He has no longing to enjoy pleasures, i.e., even though the things which he likes are near him, he has no longing for them. He is free from desire and anger; desire is longing for objects not yet obtained; he is free from this. Fear is affliction produced from the knowledge of the factors which cause separation from the beloved or from meeting with that which is not desirable; he is free from this. Anger is a disturbed state of one's own mind which produces affliction and which is aimed at another sentient being who is the cause of separation from the beloved or of confrontation with what is not desirable. He is free from this.

A sage of this sort, who constantly meditates on the self, is said to be of firm wisdom.

Then, the next state below this is described:
2.56 Dukkhesu etc.  Only that sage whose mental attitude is free from desire and hatred in the midst of pleasure and pain, and not anyone else, is a man-of-stabilized-intellect.	
 This is also proper.  For-
2.56 Moreover, that munih, monk [Sankaracarya identifies the monk with the man of realization.] ucyate, is then called; sthita-dhih, a man of steady wisdom; when anudvignamanah, his mind is unperturbed; duhkhesu, in sorrow  when his mind remains unperturbed by the sorrows that may come on the physical or other planes [Fever, headache, etc. are physical (adhyatmika) sorrows; sorrows caused by tigers, snakes, etc. are environmental (adhibhautika) sorrows; those caused by cyclones, floods, etc. are super-natural (adhidaivika). Similarly, delights also may be experienced on the three planes.] ; so also, when he is vigata-sprhah, free from longing; sukhesu, for delights  when he, unlike fire which flares up when fed with fuel etc., has no longing for delights when they come to him ; and vita-raga-bhaya-krodhah, has gone beyond attachment, fear and anger.
2.57 He who is everywhere without attachment, on meeting with anything good or bad, who neither rejoices not hastes, his wisdom is fixed.
2.57 He who wherever he goes is attached to no person and to no place by ties of flesh; who accepts good and evil alike, neither welcoming the one nor shrinking from the other - take him to be one who is merged in the Infinite.
2.57. He,  who has no desire in anything; and who neither rejoices nor hates on getting this or that,  good or bad-his intellect is properly stabilized.
2.57 He who has no love on any side, who when he finds good or evil, neither rejoices nor hates - his wisdom is firmly set.
2.57  The wisdom of that person remains established who has not attachment for anything anywhere, who neither welcomes nor rejects anything whatever good or bad when he comes across it.
2.57 He, who, has no love for all pleasing objects, i.e., who is indifferent to them, and who does not feel attraction or repulsion when he is united with or separated from attractive or repulsive objects respectively, who neither rejoices at the former, nor hates the latter - he also is of firm wisdom.

Sri Krsna now mentions the next lower state.
2.57  Yah sarvatra etc.  There is no joy or sorrow in him while meeting the good or the bad.
2.57 Further, prajna, the wisdom; tasya, of that person, fo that sannyasin; pratisthita, remains established; yah, who; anabhi-snehah, has no attachment for; sarvatra, anything anywhere, even for body, life, etc.; who na abhinanadati, neither welcomes; na dvesti, nor rejects; tat tat, anything whatever; subha-asubham, good or bad; propya, when he comes across it, i.e. who does not rejoice on meeting with the good, nor reject the bad on meeting with it. Of such a person, who is thus free from elation or dejection, the wisdom arising from discrimination remains established.
2.58 When, like the tortoise which withdraws on all sides its limbs, he withdraws his senses from the sense-objects, then his wisdom becomes steady.
2.58 He who can withdraw his senses from the attraction of their objects, as the tortoise draws his limbs within its shell - take it that such a one has attained Perfection.
2.58. When he withdraws all his sense-organs from sense-objects,  just as a tortoise does all of its own limbs,  then he is declared to be a man-of-stabilized-intellect.
2.58 When one is able to draw his senses from the objects of sense on every side, as a tortoise draws in its limbs, then his wisdom is firmly set.
2.58 And when this one fully withdraws the senses from the objects of the senses, as a tortoise wholly (withdraws) the limbs, then his wisdom remains established.
2.58 When one is able to draw the senses away from the sense-objects on every side when the senses try to contact the sense-objects, just as a tortoise draws in its limbs, and is capable of fixing his mind on the self - he too is of firm wisdom. Thus there are four stages of devotion to knowledge, each stage being perfected through the succeeding stage.

Now Sri Krsna speaks of the difficulty of the attainment of firm devotion to knowledge and the means of that attainment.
2.58 Yada samharate etc.  the nomenclature is not an expression having a composite of both the forces of etymological and traditional meanings, like the word pankaja 'a lotus'.  But it has only the etymological force like the word pacaka 'a cook'.  Whenever he (the sage) withdraws just in his own self-just as a tortoise keeps its limbs in its bossom-from the sense-objects i.e., warding off from the sense-objects, then and then [only] he is man-of-stabilized-intellect.

Or   [the passage may mean :]  Whenever he withdraws, within his own Self, [all], beginning from the sense-objects upto sense-organs i.e., when he approprites in his own Self all in the form of sense-objects and sense-organs.	
 But, how is it that the nomenclature 'a man-of-stabilized-intellect'  does not hold good in the case of an ascetic ?  It is answered-
2.58 And besides, yada, when; ayam, this one, the sannyasin practising steadfastness in Knowledge; samharate, fully withdraws; ['Fully' suggests absolute firmness in withdrawal, and 'withdraws' suggests full control over the organs] indriyani, the senses; indriya-arthhyah, from all the objects of the senses; iva, as; kurmah, a tortoise; sarvasah, wholly (withdraws); angani, its limbs, from all sides out of fear;   when the man engaged in steadfastness to Knowledge withdraws thus, then tasya, his; prajna, wisdom; pratisthita, remains established  (the meaning of this portion has already been explained).
As to that, [That is , so far as the phenomenal world is concerned.] the organs of a sick person, too, cease to be active when the refrains from sense-objects; they get fully withdrawn like the limbs of a tortoise. but not so the hankering for those objects. How that (hankering) gets completely withdrawn is being stated:
2.59 The objects of the senses turn away from the abstinent man leaving the longing (behind); but his longing also turns away on seeing the Supreme.
2.59 The objects of sense turn from him who is abstemious. Even the relish for them is lost in him who has seen the Truth.
2.59. Leaving their taste [behind],  the sense-objects retreat from the embodied who abstain from food;  his taste too disappears when he sees the Supreme.
2.59 The objects of senses, excepting relish for the objects, turn away from the abstinent dweller in the body. Even the relish turns aswy from him when what is supreme over the senses i.e., the self, is seen.
2.59 The objects recede from an abstinent man, with the exception of the taste (for them). Even the taste of this person falls away after realization the Absolute.
2.59 The sense objects are the food of the senses. From the abstinent embodied being, i.e., from one who has withdrawn his senses from objects, these sense-objects, being rejected by him, turn away, but not the relish for them. Relish means hankering. The meaning is that the hankering for the sense-objects does not go away by abstinence alone. But even this hankering will go away, when one sees that the essential nature of the self is superior to the sense-objects and that the realisation of this self gives greater happiness than the enjoyment of sense-objects.
2.59 Visayah etc.  Of course, in his (ascetic's) case there is no contact with sense-objects, colour and the rest that are enjoyable.  Yet, the sense-obects  retreat [from him] leaving a taste in the form of longing  that exists in his internal organ.  Hence he is not a man-of-stabilized-intellect.  Some (commentators)  say that 'taste'  denotes the sweetness etc., of  the objects of experience.  But, in the case of a man of Yoga there exists no longing as he has seen the Supreme Lord.  On the other hand, in the case of the other, i.e. an ascetic, this does not retreat (disappear).
2.59 Although visayah, the objects, (i.e.) the organs, figuratively implied and expressed by the word 'objects', or, the objects themselves; vinivartante, recede; niraharasya dehinah, from an abstinent man, from an embodied being, even from a fool who engages in painful austerity and abstains from objects; (still, they do so) rasavarjam, with the exception of the taste (for them), with the exception of the hankering that one has for objects. The word rasa is well known as referring to the sense of taste (hankering), as in such expressions as, 'sva-rasena pravrttah, induced by his own taste (i.e. willingly)', 'rasikah, a man of tastes', 'rasajnah, a connoisseur (of tastes)', etc. Api, even that; rasah, taste of the nature of subtle attachment; asya, of this person, of the sannyasin; nivartate, falls away, i.e. his objective perception becomes seedless; when drstva, after attaining; param, the Absolute, the Reality which is the supreme Goal, Brahman, he continues in life with the realization, 'I verily am That (Brahman).'
In the absence of full realization there can be no eradication of the 'hankering'. The idea conveyed is that, one should therefore stabilize one's wisdom which is characterized by full realization. [If it be held that attachment cannot be eliminated without the knowledge of Brahman, and at the same time that the knowledge of Brahman cannot arise until attachment is eradicated, then we get involved in a vicious circle. In answer it is said that gross attachments are eliminated through discrimination which restrains the senses from being overpowered by objects. And the full Knowledge arising thereof eliminates the subtle inclinations as well. Hence there is no vicious circle involved.]
Since the organs have to be first brought under his own control by one who desires to establish firmly the wisdom which is characterized by full realization, therefore the Lord speaks of the evil that arises from not keeping them under control:
2.6 I can hardly tell which will be better, that we should  coner them or that they should coner us. Even the sons of Dhritarashtra, after slaying whom we do not wish to live, stand facing us.
2.6 Nor can I say whether it were better that they conquer me or for me to conquer them, since would no longer care to live if I killed these sons of Dhritarashtra, now preparing for fight.
2.6. Whether we should coner [in the battle],  or they  should coner us-we do not know this viz.,  'which [of  those two] is better for us'.  [For],  having killed whom, we would not wish to live at all,  the same persons stand before us as Dhrtarastra's men.
2.6 We do not know, which of the two is better for us - whether our vanishing them, or their vanishing us. The very sons of Dhrtarastra, whom, if we slay, we should not wish to live, even they are standing in array against us.
2.6  We do not know this as well as to which is the better for us, (and) whether we shall win, or whether they shall coner us. Those very sons of Dhrtarastra, by killing whom we do not wish to live, stand in confrontation.
2.6 - 2.8 If you say, 'After beginning the war, if we withdraw from the battle, the sons of Dhrtarastra will slay us all forcibly', be it so. I think that even to be killed by them, who do not know the difference between righteousness and unrighteousness, is better for us than gaining unrighteous victory by killing them. After saying so, Arjuna surrendered himself at the feet of the Lord, overcome with dejection, saying. 'Teach me, your disciple, who has taken refuge in you, what is good for me.'
2.4-6  Katham  etc. upto  Dhartarastrah.   By the portion Bhisma and Drona in war' etc., and by the portion  'I would [not] enjoy the objects of  pleasure', the Sage indicates that in Arjuna's objection, the intention for a particular act and the intention for a particular result are the points deserving rejection.  By the portion  'We do not know this' etc., he speaks of  the intention for a particular action.   For, without intention no action is possible.  Certainly one does not proceed on a war with an intention of getting defeated.  '[In the present war]  even our victory would be surely our misfortune.'  This he says by the portion  'It is good even to go about begging without killing the elders'.  It is also impossible to conclude  'Whether we desire victory or defeat';  for even in the case of our victory our relatives would perish totally.'
2.60 The turbulent senses, O Arjuna, do violently carry away the mind of a wise man though he be striving (to control them).
2.60 O Arjuna! The mind of him, who is trying to conquer it, is forcibly carried away in spite of his efforts, by his tumultuous senses.
2.60. For, the turbulent sense-organs do carry away by force,  the mind even of this person of discerning,  O son of Kunti !
2.60 The turbulent senses, O Arjuna, do carry away perforce the mind of even a wise man, though he is ever striving.
2.60 For, O son of Kunti, the turbulent organs violently snatch away the mind of an intelligent person, even while he is striving diligently.
2.60 Except by the experience of the self, the hankering for objects will not go away. When the hankering for the sense-objects does not go away, the senses of even a wise man, though he is ever striving to subdue them, become refractory, i.e., become violent and carry away perforce the mind. Thus, the subduing of the senses depends on the vision of the self, and the vision of the self depends on the subduing of the senses. Conseently, i.e., because of this mutual dependence, firm devotion to knowledge is difficult to achieve.
2.60 Yattasyapi etc.  For, the mind of that ascetic too is carried away by the sense-organs.  Or, the expression yattasya api denotes  'even of one who exerts'.  [So], it is but the mind that is to be subdued by a man of Yoga.  Thus the second [estion] is decided.
2.60 Hi, for; kaunteya, O son of Kunti; pramathini, the turbulent; indriyani, organs; prasabham, violently; haranti, snatch away; manah, the mind; vipascitah, of an intelligent; purusasya, person; api, even; yatatah, while he is striving diligently [Repeatedly being mindful of the evils that arise from sense-objects.]  (or,) the words purusasya vipascitah (of an intelligent person) are to be connected with the remote word api (even). [The Commentator says that api may be construed either with yatatah or with vipascitah purusasya.-Tr.] Indeed, the organs confound a person who is inclined towards objects, and after confounding him, violently carry away his mind endowed with discriminating knoweldge, even when he is aware of this.
Since this is so, therefore,
2.61 Having restrained them all he should sit steadfast, intent on Me; his wisdom is steady whose senses are under control.
2.61 Restraining them all, let him meditate steadfastly on Me; for who thus conquers his senses achieves perfection.
2.61. Restraining them (the same-organs) by mind, the master of Yoga would sit making Me his goal; for, the intellect of that person is stabilized whose sense-organs are under control.
2.61 Having controlled all the senses, let him remain in contemplation, regarding Me as supreme; for, his knowledge is firmly set whose senses are under control.
2.61 Controlling all of them, one should remain concentrated on Me as the supreme. For, the wisdom of one whose organs are under control becomes steadfast.
2.61 With a desire to overcome this mutual dependence between the subduing of the senses and vision of the self, one has to coner the senses which are difficult to subdue on account of their attachment to sense-objects. So, focussing the mind on Me who am the only auspicious object for meditation, let him remain steadfast. When the mind is focussed on Me  as its object, then such a mind, purified by the burning away of all impurities and devoid of attachment to the senses, is able to control the senses. Then the mind with the senses under control will be able to experience the self. As said in Visnu Purana, 'As the leaping fire fanned by the wind burns away a forest of dry trees, so Visnu, who is in the hearts of all the Yogins, destroys all the sins.' Sri Krsna teaches the same here:  'He whose senses are under control, his knowledge is firmly set.'

Sri Krsna says:  'One who endeavours to subdue the senses, depending on one's own exertions, and does not focus the mind on Me in this way, becomes lost.'
2.61 Tani etc.  He, who restrains his sense-organs in  this manner by means of his mind, but not by inactivity-he alone is  a man-of-stabilized-intellect.  He would remain viewing Me alone as his goal i.e., he would concentrate his attention on nothing but Me, the Supreme Lord, the Consciousness-Self.
2.61 Samyamya, controlling, having subdued; sarvani, all; tani, of them; asita, one should remain; yuktah, concentrated; mat-parah, on Me as the supreme  he to whom I, Vasudeva, the inmost Self of all, am the supreme (parah) is mat-parah. The idea is, he should remain (concentrated) thinking, 'I am not different from Him.'
Hi, for; the prajna, wisdom; tasya, of one, of the sannyasin remaining thus concentrated; yasya, whose; indriyani, organs; are vase, under control, by dint of practice; [The organs come under control either by constantly thinking of oneself as non-different from the Self, or by constantly being mindful of the evils that result from objects.] pratisthita, becomes steadfast.
Now, then, is being stated this [This:what is described in the following two verses, and is also a matter of common experience.] root, cause of all the evils that beset one who is the verge of being overwhelmed:
2.62 When a man thinks of the objects, attachment for them arises; from attachment desire is born; from desire anger arises.
2.62 When a man dwells on the objects of sense, he creates an attraction for them; attraction develops into desire, and desire breeds anger.
2.62. In a person, meditating on sense-objects, attachment or them is born in succession;  from attachment springs passion; from passion arises wrath.
2.62 To a man thinking about sense-objects, there arises attachment to them; form attachment arises desire, from desire arises anger;
2.62-2.63 In the case of a person who dwells on objects, there arises attachment for them. From attachment grows hankering, from hankering springs anger.
2.62 Indeed, in respect of a person, whose attachment to sense-objects is expelled but whose mind is not focussed on Me, even though he controls the senses, contemplation on sense-objects is unavoidable on account of the impressions of sins from time immemorial. Again attachment increases fully in 'a man who thinks about sense-objects'. From attachment arises desire.' What is called 'desire' is the further stage of attachment. After reaching that stage, it is not possible for a man to stay without experiencing the sense-objects. 'From such desire arises anger.' When a desire exists without its object being nearby, anger arises against persons nearby under the following. 'Our desire is thwarted by these persons.'

'From anger there comes delusion'. Delusion is want of discrimination between what ought to be done and what ought not to be done. Not possessing that discrimination one does anything and everything. Then there follows the failure of memory, i.e., of the impressions of the earlier efforts of sense control, when one strives again to control the senses.
2.62 See Comment under 2.63
2.62 Pumsah, in the case of a person; dhyayatah, who dwells on, thinks of; visayan, the objects, the specialities [Specialities: The charms imagined in them.] of the objects such as sound etc.; upajayate, there arises; sangah, attachment, fondness, love; tesu, for them, for those objects. Sangat, from attachment, from love; sanjayate, grows; kamah, hankering, thirst. When that is obstructed from any arter, kamat, from hankering; abhijayate, springs; krodhah, anger. Krodhat, from anger; bhavati, follows; sammohah, delusion, absence of discrimination with regard to what should or should not be done. For, an angry man, becoming deluded, abuses even a teacher.
Sammohat, from delusion; (comes) smrti-vibhramah, failure of memory originating from the impressions acired from the instructions of the scriptures and teachers. When there is an occasion for memory to rise, it does not occur. Smrti-bhramsat, from that failure of memory; (results) buddhi-nasah, loss of understanding. The unfitness of the mind to discriminate between what should or should not be done is called loss of understanding. Buddhi-nasat, from the loss of understanding; pranasyati, he perishes. Indeed, a man continues tobe himself so long as his mind remains fit to distinguish between what he ought to and ought not do. When it becomes unfit, a man is verily ruined. Therefore, when his internal organ, his understanding, is destroyed, a man is ruined, i.e. he becomes unfit for the human Goal.
Thinking of objects has been said to be the root of all evils. After that, this which is the cause of Liberation is being now stated: [If even the memory of objects be a source of evil, then their enjoyment is more so. Hence, a sannyasin seeking Liberation cannot avoid this evil, since he has to move about for food which is necessary for the maintenance of his body. The present verse is an answer to this apprehension.]
2.63 From anger comes delusion; from delusion loss of memory; from loss of memory the destruction of discrimination; from the destruction of discrimination he perishes.
2.63 Anger induces delusion; delusion, loss of memory; through loss of memory, reason is shattered; and loss of reason leads to destruction.
2.63. From wrath delusion comes to be;  from delusion is the loss of  memory;  from the loss of memory is the loss of capacity to decide;  due to the loss of capacity to decide,  he perishes outright.
2.63 From anger there comes delusion; from delusion, the loss of memory; from the loss of memory, the destruction of discrimination; and with the destruction of discrimination, he is lost.
2.63 From anger follows delusion; from delusion, failure of memory; from failure of memory, the loss of understanding; from the loss of understanding, he perishes.
2.63 'From the loss of memory there comes the destruction of discrimination.' The meaning is that there will be destruction of the effect of efforts made earlier to attain the knowledge of the self. From the destruction of discrimination, one becomes lost, i.e., is sunk in Samsara or worldliness.
2.63 Dhyayatah etc.  krodhat etc.  In the case of an ascetic, the very act of abandoning sense-objects itself resutls in undertaking the sense-objects.  For, they abandon indeed by meditating  [on them], and at the very time of such a meditation, attachment etc., are born in regular succession.  Hence the act of abandoning objects is harmless only in the case of a man-of-stabilized-intellect. (65)
2.63 Pumsah, in the case of a person; dhyayatah, who dwells on, thinks of; visayan, the objects, the specialities [Specialities: The charms imagined in them.] of the objects such as sound etc.; upajayate, there arises; sangah, attachment, fondness, love; tesu, for them, for those objects. Sangat, from attachment, from love; sanjayate, grows; kamah, hankering, thirst. When that is obstructed from any arter, kamat, from hankering; abhijayate, springs; krodhah, anger. Krodhat, from anger; bhavati, follows; sammohah, delusion, absence of discrimination with regard to what should or should not be done. For, an angry man, becoming deluded, abuses even a teacher.
Sammohat, from delusion; (comes) smrti-vibhramah, failure of memory originating from the impressions acired from the instructions of the scriptures and teachers. When there is an occasion for memory to rise, it does not occur. Smrti-bhramsat, from that failure of memory; (results) buddhi-nasah, loss of understanding. The unfitness of the mind to discriminate between what should or should not be done is called loss of understanding. Buddhi-nasat, from the loss of understanding; pranasyati, he perishes. Indeed, a man continues tobe himself so long as his mind remains fit to distinguish between what he ought to and ought not do. When it becomes unfit, a man is verily ruined. Therefore, when his internal organ, his understanding, is destroyed, a man is ruined, i.e. he becomes unfit for the human Goal.
Thinking of objects has been said to be the root of all evils. After that, this which is the cause of Liberation is being now stated: [If even the memory of objects be a source of evil, then their enjoyment is more so. Hence, a sannyasin seeking Liberation cannot avoid this evil, since he has to move about for food which is necessary for the maintenance of his body. The present verse is an answer to this apprehension.]
2.64 But the self-controlled man, moving among the objects with the senses under restraint and free from attraction and repulsion, attains to peace.
2.64 But the self-controlled soul, who moves amongst sense objects, free from either attachment or repulsion, he wins eternal Peace.
2.64. On the contrary,  one who moves about (consumes) the sense-objects by means of his senseorgans,  that are freed from desire and hatred and are controlled in the Self-such one with a disciplined self (mind) attains serenity  [of disposition].
2.64 But he who goes through the sense-objects with the senses free from love and hate, disciplined and controlled, attains serenity.
2.64 But by perceiving objects with the organs that are free from attraction and repulsion, and are under his own control, the self-controlled man attains serenity.
2.64 Having focussed, in the way already described, the mind on Me - the Lord of all and the auspicious object of meditation, he who goes through, i.e., considers with contempt the sense-objects, with senses under control and free from hate and attraction by reason of all impurities of mind being burnt out - such a person has a disciplined self, i.e., disciplined mind. He attains serenity. The meaning is that his mind will be free of impurities.
2.64 See Comment under 2.68
2.64 Certainly the functions of the organs are naturally preceded by attraction and repulsion. This being so, caran, by perceiving; visayan, objects, which are unavoidable; indriyaih, with the organs such as ears etc.; raga-dvesa-viyuktaih, that are free from those attraction and repulsion; and are atma-vasyaih, under his own control; vidheya-atma, [A.G. takes atma-vasyaih in the sense of '(with the organs) under the control of the mind'. He then argues that it the mind be not under control, there can be no real control, over the organs. Hence the text uses the second expression, 'vidheyatma, whose mind can be subdued at will'. Here atma is used in the sense of the mind, according to the Commentator himself.] the self-controlled man, whose mind can be subdued at will, a seeker after Liberation; adhigacchati, attains; prasadam, serenity, self-poise.
What happens when there is serenity? This is being answered:
2.65 In that peace all pains are destroyed; for the intellect of the tranil-minded soon becomes steady.
2.65 Having attained Peace, he becomes free from misery; for when the mind gains peace, right discrimination follows.
2.65. On attaining serenity,  there arises in succession the extinction of all miseries; the capacity to decide gets stabilized soon indeed in the case of a serene-minded one.
2.65 In that serenity there is loss of all sorrow; for in the case of the person with a serene mind, the Buddhi soon becomes well established.
2.65 When there is serenity, there follows eradication of all his sorrows, because the wisdom of one who has a serene mind soon becomes firmly established.
2.65 When the mind of this person gets serene, he gets rid of all sorrows originating from contact with matter. For, in respect of the peson whose mind is serene, i.e., is free from the evil which is antagonistic to the vision of the self, the Buddhi, having the pure self for its object, becomes established immediately. Thus, when the mind is serene, the loss of all sorrow surely arises.
2.65 See Comment under 2.68
2.65 Prasade, when there is serenity; upajayate, there follows; hanih, eradication; asya sarva-duhkhanam, of all his, the sannyasin's, sorrow on the physical and other planes. Moreover, (this is so) hi, because; buddhih, the wisdom; prasanna-cetasah, of one who has a serene mind, of one whose mind is poised in the Self; asu, soon; pari-avatisthate, becomes firmly established; remains steady (avatisthate) totally (pari), like the sky, i.e. it becomes unmoving in its very nature as the Self.
The meaning of the sentence is this: Since a person with such a poised mind and well-established wisdom attains fulfilment, therefore a man of concentration [A man who is free whom slavery to objects of the senses.] ought to deal with the indispensable and scripturally non-forbidden objects through his senses that are free from love and hatred.
That same serenity is being eulogized:
2.66 There is no knowledge of the Self to the unsteady and to the unsteady no meditation is possible, and to the unmeditative there can be no peace, and to the man who has no peace, how can there be happiness?
2.66 Right discrimination is not for him who cannot concentrate. Without concentration, there cannot be meditation; he who cannot meditate must not expect peace; and without peace, how can anyone expect happiness?
2.66. The capacity to decide is not for one who is not a master of Yoga; and concentration of mind is not for one who is not a master of Yoga;  and peace is not for one who does not concentrate;  wherefrom could happiness come to one who has no peace ?
2.66 There is no Buddhi for the unintegrated, nor for him is there contemplation of the self, and for him without contemplation of the self, there is no peace; and for one lacking peace, where is happiness?
2.66 For the unsteady there is no wisdom, and there is no meditation for the unsteady man. And for an unmeditative man there is no peace. How can there be happiness for one without peace?
2.66 In him who does not focus his mind on Me but is engaged only in the control of senses by his own exertion, the Buddhi or the right disposition that is concerned with the pure self never arises. Therefore he fails in the practice of meditation on the self. In one who cannot think of the pure self, there arises the desire for sense objects; in him serenity does not arise. How can eternal and unsurpassed bliss be generated in him who is not serene but is attached to sense-objects?  [The idea is that without the aid of devotion to God, the effort to control the senses by one's will power alone will end in failure.]

 Sri Krsna speaks again of the calamity that befalls one who does not practise the control of the senses in the way prescribed above:
2.66 See Comment under 2.68
2.66 Ayuktasya, for the unsteady, for one who does not have a concentrated mind; na asti, there is no, i.e. there does not arise; buddhih, wisdom, with regard to the nature of the Self; ca, and; there is no bhavana, meditation, earnest longing [Longing to have a continuous remembrance of the knowledge of Brahman which arises in the mind from hearing the great Upanisadic sayings (maha-vakyas).] for the knowledge of the Self; ayuktasya, for an unsteady man. And similarly, abhavayatah, for an unmeditative man, who does not ardently desire the knowledge of the Self; there is no santih, peace, restraint of the senses. Kutah, how can there be; sukham, happiness; asantasya, for one without peace? That indeed is happiness which consists in the freedom of the senses from the thirst for enjoyment of objects; not the thirst for objects  that is misery to be sure.
The implication is that, so long as thirst persists, there is no possibility of even an iota of happiness!
It is being stated why a man without concentration does not possess wisdom:
2.67 For the mind, which follows in the wake of the wandering senses, carries away his discrimination, as the wind (carries away) a boat on the waters.
2.67 As a ship at sea is tossed by the tempest, so the reason is carried away by the mind when preyed upon by straying senses.
2.67. That mind,  which is directed to follow the wandering  (enjoying) sense-organs-that mind carries away his knowledge just as wind does a ship on waters.
2.67 For, when the mind follows the senses experiencing their objects, his understanding is carried away by them as the wind carries away a ship on the waters.
2.67 For, the mind which follows in the wake of the wandering senses, that (mind) carries away his wisdom like the mind (diverting) a boat on the waters.
2.67 That mind, which is allowed by a person to be submissive to, i.e., allowed to go after the senses which go on operating, i.e., experiencing sense-objects, such a mind loses its inclination towards the pure self. The meaning is that it gets inclined towards sense-objects. Just as a contrary wind forcibly carries away a ship moving on the waters, in the name manner wisdon also is carried away from such a mind. [The idea is that the pursuit of sense pleasures dulls one's spiritual inclination, and the mind ultimately succumbs to them unresisting.]
2.67 See Comment under 2.68
2.67 Hi, for; yat manah, the mind which; anu-vidhiyate, follows in the wake of; caratam, the wandering; indriyani, senses that are tending towards their respective objects; tat, that, the mind engaged in thinking [Perceiving objects like sound etc. in their respective varieties.] of the objects of the senses; harati, carries away, destroys; asya, his, the sannyasin's; prajnam, wisdom born from the discrimination between the Self and the not-Self. How? Iva, like; vayuh, the wind; diverting a navam, boat; ambhasi, on the waters. As wind, by diverting a boat on the waters from its intended course, drives it along a wrong course, similarly the mind, by diverting the wisdom from the pursuit of the Self, makes it engage in objects.
After having stated variously the reasons for the idea conveyed through the verse, 'For, O son of Kunti,' etc. (60), and having established that very idea, the Lord concludes thus:
2.68 Therefore, O mighty-armed Arjuna, his knowledge is steady whose senses are completely restrained from sense-objects.
2.68 Therefore, O Might-in-Arms, he who keeps his senses detached from their objects - take it that his reason is purified.
2.68. Therefore, O mighty-armed one, the intellect of that person is stabilized, all of whose sense-organs,  starting from sense-objects have been well restrained.
2.68 Therefore, O mighty-armed, he whose senses are restrained from going after their objects on all sides, his wisdom is firmly set.
2.68 Therefore, O mighty-armed one, this wisdom becomes established whose organs in all their varieties are withdrawn from their objects.
2.68 Therefore, in the way described above, he whose mind is focussed on Me the auspicious object for meditation, and whose senses are thery restrained from sense-objects in everyway, in his mind alone wisdom is firmly set.

Sri Krsna now speaks of the state of attainment by one whose senses are subdued and whose mind is serene.
2.64-68 Raga-dvesa-etc.  upto pratisthita.  Here the purport is this :  He, who controls his mind, is not tossed by the waves of wrath etc., even while he is enjoying the sense-objects;  hence he alone is a man of Yoga, a man-of-stabilized-intellect.         
 Extraordinary is the man of Yoga, even while he is attending to the worldly business.  While examining this point, the characteristics mark of his (man of  Yoga),  is briefly related by the Supreme Lord-
2.68 Since the evils arising from the activities of the organs have been described, tasmat, therefore; mahabaho, O mighty-armed one; tasya, his, the sannyasin's; prajna, wisdom; pratisthita, becomes established; yasya, whose; indriyani, organs; sarvasah, in all their varieties, differentiated as mind etc.; nigrhitani, are withdrawn; indriya-arthhyah, from their objects such as sound etc.
In the case of a man of steady wisdom in whom has arisen discriminating knowledge, those which are these ordinary and Vedic dealings cease on the eradication of ignorance, they being effects of ignorance. And ignorance ceases because it is opposed to Knowledge. For clarifying this idea, the Lord says:
2.69 That which is night to all beings, in that the self-controlled man is awake; when all beings are awake, that is night for the Muni (sage) who sees.
2.69 The saint is awake when the world sleeps, and he ignores that for which the world lives.
2.69. What is night for every  [other]  being, in that a man of self-restraint is awake; wherein [every other] being is awake, that is night for the sage who sees [the truth].
2.69 What is night for all beings, in it the controlled one is awake; when all beings are awake, that is the night to the sage who sees.
2.69 The self-restrained man keeps awake during that which is night for all creatures. That during which creatures keep awake, it is night to the seeing sage.
2.69 That Buddhi (understanding) which has the self for its object, is night to all beings, i.e., is obscure like night to all. But he, who has subdued the senses and is serene, is awake in respect of the self. The meaning is that he has the vision of the self. All beings are awake, i.e., are actively cognisant in respect of objects of the senses like sound. But such sense objects are like things enshrouded by night to the sage who is awake to the self.
2.69 Ya nisa etc.  Infatuating is the Illusion which is night for all beings.  In that , the sage is awake (vigilant) with the thought  'How It could be avoided'  The stage where the worldly men keep awake i.e., perform multifarious  [worldly]  activities, that stage is the night for the sage, as he is ignorant regarding the worldly activities.
 
It amounts to this statement :  What is well-known as illusion, Its nature is indeed two-ford, viz., to delude and also to wear a deceptive appearance of spinning pleasure.  Of them (the two natures),  the worldly man, not considering Its former nautre, remains with a memory well teid to the second nature.  On the other hand, the man of Yoga, who is contrary to the other,  observes Its deluding nature in order to root It out.  Thus the man of perfect knowledge, while seeing  [properly],  pays no attention to Its nature of spinning pleasure.   His indifference to Its nature of spinning pleasure is due to the destruction of his false knowledge.  That stage is night to him, even while he sees.  Hence this is strange.  The man of Yoga is  awake (or understands)  in the field of wisdom, where everyone else is unconscious (or totally perplexed);  but in  [the field]  of ignorance he is not awake  (or does not understand),  where ordinary man is awake (or understands well).  This is also strange.
 That is why-
2.69 ya, that which; sarva-bhutanam, for all creatures; is nisa, night  which being darkness (tamah) by nature, obliterates distinctions among all things; what is that? that is the Reality which is the supreme Goal, accessible to the man of steady wisdom. As that which verily appears as day to the nocturnal creatures is night for others, similarly the Reality wich is the supreme Goal appears to be night, as it were, to all unenlightened beings who are comparable to the nocturnal creatures, because It is beyond the range of vision of those who are devoid of that wisdom.
Samyami, the self-restrained man, whose organs are under control, i.e. the yogi [The man of realization.] who has arisen from the sleep of ignorance; jagarti, keeps awake; tasyam, in that (night) characterized as the Reality, the supreme Goal. That night of ignorance, characterized by the distinctions of subjects and objects, yasyam in which; bhutani, the creatures, who are really asleep; are said to be jagrati, keeping awake, in which night they are like dreamers in sleep; sa nisa, it is night; pasyatah, to the seeing; muneh, sage, who perceives the Reality that is the supreme Goal, because that (night) is ignorance by nature.
Therefore, rites and duties are enjoined only during the state of ignorance, not in the state of enlightenment. For, when Knowledge dawns, ignorance becomes eradicated like the darkness of night after sun-rise. [It may be argued that even after illumination the phenomenal world, though it is known to be false, will continue to be perceived because of the persistence of past impressions; therefore there is scope for the validity of the scriptural injunctions even in the case of an illumined soul. The answer is that there will be no scope for the injunctions, because the man of realization will then have no ardent leaning towards this differentiated phenomenal world which makes an injunction relevant.] Before the rise of Knowledge, ignorance, accepted as a valid means of knowledge and presenting itself in the different forms of actions, means and results, becomes the cause of all rites and duties. It cannot reasonably become the source of rites and duties (after Realization) when it is understood as an invalid means of knowledge. For an agent becomes engaged in actions when he has the idea, 'Actions have been enjoined as a duty for me by the Vedas, which are a valid means of knowledge'; but not when he understands that 'all this is mere ignorance, like the night'.
Again, the man to whom has come the Knowledge that all these differences in their totality are mere ignorance like the night, to that man who has realized the Self, there is eligibility only for renouncing all actions, not for engaging in actions. In accordance with this the Lord will show in the verse, 'Those who have their intellect absorbed in That, whose Self is That' (5.17) etc., that he has competence only for steadfastness in Knowledge.
Objection: May it not be argued that, there will be no reason for being engaged even in that (steadfastness in Knowledge) if there be no valid means of knowledge [Vedic injunctions.] to impel one to that. [Because, without an injunction nobody would engage in a duty, much less in steadfastness to Knowledge.]
Answer: No, since 'knowledge of the Self' relates to one's own Self. Indeed, by the very fact that It is the Self, and since the validity of all the means of knowledge culminates in It, [The validity of all the means of knowledge holds good only so long as the knowledge of the Self has not arisen.] therefore the Self does not depend on an injunction to impel It towards Itself. [Does the injunction relate to the knowledge of the Self. or to the Self Itself? The first alternative is untenable because a valid means of knowledge reveals its objects even without an injunction. The second alternative also is untenable because the Self is self-revealing, whereas an injunction is possible in the case of something yet to be achieved. And one's own Self is not an object of that kind.] Surely, after the realization of the true nature of the Self, there is no scope again for any means to, or end of, knowledge. The last valid means of (Self-) knowledge eradicates the possibility of the Self's becoming a perceiver. And even as it eradicates, it loses its own authoritativeness, in the same way as the means of knowledge which is valid in dream becomes unauthoritative during the waking state. In the world, too, after the preception of an abject, the valid means of that perception is not seen to be a cause impelling the knower (to any action with regard to that object).
Hence, it is established that, for an knower of the Self, there remains no eligibility for rites and duties.
The attainment of Liberation is only for the sannyasin [Liberation is attained only by one who, after aciring an intellectual knowledge of the Self in a general way, is endowed with discrimination and detachment, has arisen above all desires, has become a monk in the primary sense, and has directly realized the Self by going through the process of sravana (understanding of Upanisadic texts about the Self), etc.], the man of enlightenment, who has renounced all desires and is a man of steady wisdom; but not for him who has not renounced and is desirious of the objects (of the senses). Such being the case, with a view to establishing this with the help of an illustration, the Lord says:
2.7 My heart is overpowered by the taint of pity; my mind is confused as to duty. I ask Thee: Tell me decisively what is good for me. I am Thy disciple. Instruct me who has taken refuge in Thee.
2.7 My heart is oppressed with pity; and my mind confused as to what my duty is. Therefore, my Lord, tell me what is best for my spiritual welfare, for I am Thy disciple. Please direct me, I pray.
2.7. With my very nature,  overpowered by the taint of pity,  and with my mind, utterly confused as to the right action [at the present juncture],   I ask you:  Tell me definitely what would be good  [to me];  I am your pupil;  please teach me, who am taking refuge in You.
2.7 With my heart stricken by the fault of weak compassion, with my mind perplexed about my duty, I reest you to say for certain what is good for me. I am your disciple. Teach me who have taken refuge in you.
2.7  With my nature overpowered by weak commiseration, with a mind bewildered about duty, I supplicate You. Telll me for certain that which is better; I am Your disciple. Instruct me who have taken refuge in You.
2.6 - 2.8 If you say, 'After beginning the war, if we withdraw from the battle, the sons of Dhrtarastra will slay us all forcibly', be it so. I think that even to be killed by them, who do not know the difference between righteousness and unrighteousness, is better for us than gaining unrighteous victory by killing them. After saying so, Arjuna surrendered himself at the feet of the Lord, overcome with dejection, saying. 'Teach me, your disciple, who has taken refuge in you, what is good for me.'
2.7 See Comment under 2.10
2.70 He attains peace into whom all desires enter as waters enter the ocean which, filled from all sides, remains unmoved; but not the man who is full of desires.
2.70 He attains Peace, into whom desires flow as rivers into the ocean, which though brimming with water remains ever the same; not he whom desire carries away.
2.70. Just as waters enter into the ocean which is being filled continuously and which is [yet] firmly established,  in the same way, he into whom all objects of desire enter-he attains peace;  not he who longs for the objects of desire.
2.70 He into whom all desires enter as the waters enter the full and undisturbed sea, attains to peace, and not he who longs after objects of desire.
2.70 That man attains peace into whom all desires enter in the same way as the waters flow into a sea that remains unchanged (even) when being filled up from all sides. Not so one who is desirous of objects.
2.70 The river waters enter into the sea which is full by itself and is thus the same, i.e., unchanging in shape. The sea exhibits no special increase or decrease, whether the waters or rivers enter it or not. Even so do all objects of desire, i.e., objects of sense perception like sound etc., enter into a self-controlled one, i.e., they produce only sensorial impressions but no reaction from him. Such a person will attain peace. The meaning is that he alone attains to peace, who by reason of the contentment coming from the vision of the self, feels no disturbance when objects of sense like sound, etc., come within the ken of the senses or when they do not come. This is not the case with one who runs after desires. Whoever is agitated by sound and other objects, never attains to peace.
2.70 Apuryamanam etc.   the man of  Yoga does not run out for the sake of pleasure;  but, rather just as the floods of the rivers enter into the sea, the objects of pleasure  [themselves]  continuously enter into him on account of their being peculiar attributes of the sense-organs;  and they do not create in him waves  [of agitation].  thus the third estion is decided.
2.70 Sah, that man; apnoti, attains; santim, peace Liberation; yam, into whom, into which person; sarve, all; kamah, desires, all forms of wishes; pravisanti, enter, from all directions, like waters entering into a sea, without overwhelming him even in the presence of objects; they vanish in the Self, they do not bring It under their own influence, tadvat, in the same way; yadvat, as; apah, waters, coming from all sides; pravisanti, flow into; samudram, a sea; that remains acala-pratistham, unchanged, that continues to be its own self, without any change; apuryamanam, (even) when filled up from all sides with water.
Na, not so the other; who is kama-kami, desirous of objects. Kama means objects which are sought after. He who is given to desire them is kama-kami. The idea implied is that he never attains (peace).
Since this is so, therefore.
2.71 That man attains peace who, abandoning all desires, moves about without longing, without the sense of mine and without egoism.
2.71 He attains Peace who, giving up desire, moves through the world without aspiration, possessing nothing which he can call his own, and free from pride.
2.71. That person, who, by abandoning all desires, consumes [objects]  without longing, without a sense of possession and without egotism-he attains peace.
2.71 The man who, abandoning all desires, abides without longing and possession and the sense of 'I' and 'mine', wins peace.
2.71 That man attains peace who, after rejecting all desires, moves about free from hankering, without the idea of ('me' and) 'mine', and devoid of pride.
2.71 What are desired, they are called the objects of desire. These are sound and other sense-objects. The person, who wants peace must abandon all sense-objects such as sound, touch etc. He should have no longing for them. He should be without the sense of 'mineness' regarding them, as that sense arises from the misconception that the body, which is really non-self, is the self. He who lives in this way attains to peace after seeing the self.
2.71 Vihaya etc. Because he has renounced all desires, the man of Yoga, attains emancipation in the form of peace.
2.71 Sah puman, that man who has become thus, the sannyasin, the man of steady wisdom, the knower of Brahman; adhi-gacchati, attains; santim, peace, called Nirvana, consisting in the cessation of all the sorrows of mundane existence, i.e. he becomes one with Brahman; yah, who; vihaya, after rejecting; sarvan, all; kaman, desires, without a trace, fully; carati, moves about, i.e. wanders about, making efforts only for maintaining the body; nihsprhah, free from hankering, becoming free from any longing even for the maintenance of the body; nirmamah, without the idea of ('me' and) 'mine', without the deeprooted idea of 'mine' even when accepting something needed merely for the upkeep of the body; and nir-ahankarah, devoid of pride, i.e. free from self esteem owing to learning etc.
This steadfastness in Knowledge, which is such, is being praised:
2.72 This is the Brahmic seat (eternal state), O son of Pritha. Attaining to this, none is deluded. Being established therein, even at the end of life, one attains to oneness with Brahman.
2.72 O Arjuna! This is the state of the Self, the Supreme Spirit, to which if a man once attain, it shall never be taken from him. Even at the time of leaving the body, he will remain firmly enthroned there, and will become one with the Eternal."
2.72. O son of Prtha !  This is the Brahmanic state;  having attained this, one never gets deluded [again];  and even by remaining in this [for a while] one attains at the time of death,  the Brahman,  the Tranil One.
2.72 This is the Brahmi-state, O Arjuna. None attaining to this is deluded. By abiding in this state even at the hour of death, one wins the self.
2.72 O Partha, this is the state of being established in Brahman. One does not become deluded after attaining this. One attains identification with Brahman by being established in this state even in the closing years of one's life.
2.72 This state of performing disinterested work which is preceded by the knowledge of the eternal self and which is characterised by firm wisdom, is the Brahmi-state, which secures the attainment of the Brahman (the self). After attaining such a state, he will not be deluded, i.e., he will not get again the mortal coil. Reaching this state even during the last years of life, he wins the blissful Brahman (the self) i.e., which is full of beatitude. The meaning is that he attains the self which is constituted of nothing but bliss.

Thus in the second chapter, the Lord wanted to remove the delusion of Arjuna, who did not know the real nature of the self and also did not realize that the activity named 'war' (here an ordained duty) is a means for attaining the nature of Sankhya or the self. Arjuna was under the delusion that the body is itself the self, and dominated by that delusion, had retreated from battle. He was therefore taught the knowledge called 'Sankhya' or the understanding of the self, and Yoga or what is called the path of practical work without attachment. These together have as their objective the attainment of steady wisdom (Sthitaprajnata)

This has been explained in the following verse by Sri Yamunacarya:  Sankhya and Yoga, which comprehend within their scope the understanding of the eternal self and the practical way of disinterested action respectively, were imparted in order to remove Arjuna's delusion.

Through them the state of firm wisdom can be reached.
2.72 Esa etc. This is the Brahman-existance by remaining, i.e., having dwalt in which, even for a moment, one attains the Supreme Brahman [after] one's body breaks. Thus [all the] four estions have been decided.
2.72 O Partha, esa, this, the aforesaid; is brahmisthitih, the state of being established in Brahman, i.e. continuing (in life) in indentification with Brahman, after renouncing all actions.
Na vimuhyati, one does not become deluded; prapya, after attaining ; enam, this Rcchati, one attains; brahma-nirvanam, identification with Brahman, Liberation; sthitva, by being established; asyam, in this, in the state of Brahman-hood as described; api, even; anta-kale, in the closing years of one's life. What need it be said that, one who remains established only in Brahman during the whole life, after having espoused monasticism even from the stage of celibacy, attains indetification with Brahman!
2.8 I do not see that it would remove this sorrow that burns up my senses, even if I should attain prosperous and unrivalled dominion on earth or lordship over the gods.
2.8 For should I attain the monarchy of the visible world, or over the invisible world, it would not drive away the anguish which is now paralysing my senses."
2.8. I do not clearly see what would drive out my grief,  the scorcher of my sense-organs,  even after achieving,  a prosperous and unrivalled kingship in this earth and also the overlordship of the gods  [in the heaven].
2.8 Even if I should win unchallenged sovereignty of a prosperous earth or even the kingdom on lordship over the Devas, I do not feel that it would dispel the grief than withers up my senses.
2.8  Because, I do not see that which can, even after aciring on this earth a prosperous kingdom free from enemies and even sovereignty over the gods, remove my sorrow (which is) blasting the senses.
2.6 - 2.8 If you say, 'After beginning the war, if we withdraw from the battle, the sons of Dhrtarastra will slay us all forcibly', be it so. I think that even to be killed by them, who do not know the difference between righteousness and unrighteousness, is better for us than gaining unrighteous victory by killing them. After saying so, Arjuna surrendered himself at the feet of the Lord, overcome with dejection, saying. 'Teach me, your disciple, who has taken refuge in you, what is good for me.'
2.8 See Comment under 2.10
2.9 Sanjaya said  Having spoken thus to Hrishikesha (the Lord of the senses), Arjuna (the coneror of sleep), the destroyer of foes, said to Krishna, "I will not fight" and became silent.
2.9 Sanjaya continued: "Arjuna, the conqueror of all enemies, then told the Lord of All-Hearts that he would no fight, and became silent, O King!
2.9. Sanjaya said   O scorcher of foes (O Dhrtarastra) !  Having spoken to Hrsikesa (the master of sense-organs),  Govinda (Krsna)  in this manner,  and having declared  'I will not fight',  Gudakesa (Arjuna),  became silent !
2.9 Sanjaya said  Having spoken thus to Sri Krsna, Arjuna, the coneror of sleep and the scorcher of foes, said, 'I will not fight' and became silent.
2.9 Sanjaya said  Having spoken thus to Hrsikesa (Krsna), Gudakesa (Arjuna), the afflictor of foes, verily became silent, telling Govinda, 'I shall not fight.' fight.'
2.9 - 2.10 Sanjaya said  Thus, the Lord, the Supreme Person, introduced the Sastra regarding the self for the sake of Arjuna - whose natural courage was lost due to love and compassion in a misplaced situation, who thought war to be unrighteous even though it was the highest duty for warriors (Ksatriyas), and who took refuge in Sri Krsna to know what his right duty was -, thinking that Arjuna's delusion would not come to an end except by the knowledge of the real nature of the self, and that war was an ordained duty here which, when freed from attachment to fruits, is a means for self-knowledge. Thus,  has it been said by Sri Yamunacarya: 'The introduction to the Sastra was begun for the sake of Arjuna, whose mind was agitated by misplaced love and compassion and by the delusion that righteousness was unrighteousness, and who took refuge in Sri Krsna.'


The Supreme Person spoke these words as if smiling, and looking at Arjuna, who was thus overcome by grief resulting from ignorance about the real nature of the body and the self, but was nevertheless speaking about duty as if he had an understanding that the self is distinct from the body, and while he (Arjuna), torn between contradictory ideas, had suddenly become inactive standing between the two armies that were getting ready to fight. Sri Krsna said, as if in ridicule, to Arjuna the words beginning with, 'There never was a time when I did not exist' (II. 12), and ending with 'I will release you from all sins; grieve not!' (XVIII. 66) - which have for their contents the real nature of the self, of the Supreme Self, and of the paths of work (Karma), knowledge (Jnana) and devotion (Bhakti) which constitute the means for attaining the highest spiritual fulfilment.

3.1 Arjuna said  If Thou thinkest that knowledge is superior to action, O Krishna, why then, O Kesava, dost Thou ask me to engage in this terrible action?
3.1 "Arjuna questioned: My Lord! If Wisdom is above action, why dost Thou advise me to engage in this terrible fight?
3.1. Arjuna said  O Janardana,  if  knowledg is held to be superior to action by You,  then why do You engage me in action that is terrible,  O Kesava ?
3.1 Arjuna said  If, O Krsna, you consider that Buddhi (knowledge) is superior to works, why do you engage me in this terrible deed?
3.1  Arjuna said  O Janardana (krsna), if it be Your opinion that wisdom is superior to action, why they do you urge me to horrible aciton, O Kesava ?
3.1 'Arjuna said  If you consider that knowledge is superior to works, why do you engage me in this terrible deed?' What is said here is this:  If the firm adherence to knowledge is the only means to the vision of the self, then how can one accept the idea that devotion to works (Karma) leads to it?  It was said before that this firm devotion to knowledge, which forms the means for the vision of the self, could arise by the cessation of the activities of all the senses and the mind in relation to their respective objects such as sound. If the vision of the self is to be attained, which arises by the cessation of the activities of the senses, I should be guided to engage myself solely to acire firm devotion to knowledge, which is preceded by the abandoning of all works. For what purpose, then, do you engage me in this terrible deed, which consists in the activities of all the senses, and is thus an obstacle for the vision of the self?
3.1 See Comment under 3.2
3.1 O Janardana, cet, if it be; te, Your; mata, opinion, intention; that buddhih, Wisdom; jyayasi, is superior; karmanah, to action-.
If the combination of Wisdom and action be intended (by the Lord), then the means to Liberation is only one. [The path combining Wisdom and action.] In that case, Arjuna would have done something illogical in separating Wisdom from action by saying that Wisdom is superior to action. For, that (Wisdom or action, which is a constituent of the combination) cannot be greater than that (Combination, even) from the point of view of the result. [Since what is intended is a combination, therefore, the separation of Knowledge from action, from the point of view of the result, is not justifiable. When Knowledge and action are considered to form together a single means to Liberation, in that case each of them cannot be considered separately as producing its own distinct result. Arjuna's estion can be justified only if this separation were possible.] Similarly, what Arjuna said by way of censuring the Lord, as it were, in, 'It has been stated by the Lord that Wisdom is superior to action, and He exhorts me saying, "Undertake action," which is a source of evil! What may be the reason for this?', and also in, 'Tatkim, why then, O Kesava; niyojayasi, do You urge; mam, me; to ghore, horrible, cruel; karmani, action; involving injury?'-that (censure) also does not become reasonable.
On the other hand, [If the opponent's view be that Knowledge is to be combined with rites and duties sanctioned by the Vedas and the Smrtis in the case of the householders only, whereas for others those sanctioned by the Smrtis alone are to be combined with Knowledge৷৷., then৷৷.] if it be supposed that the combination (of Knowledge) with action sanctioned only by the Smrtis has been enjoined for all by the Lord, and Arjuna also comprehended (accordingly), then, how can the statement, 'Why then do you urge me to horrible action', be rational?
Besides,
3.10 The Creator, having in the beginning (of creation) created mankind together with sacrifice, said, "By this shall ye propagate; let this be the milch cow of your desires (the cow which yields all the desired objects)."
3.10 In the beginning, when God created all beings by the sacrifice of Himself, He said unto them: Through sacrifice you can procreate, and it shall satisfy all your desires.
3.10. Having created creatures formerly [at the time of creation] together with necessary action,  the Lord of creatures declared :  'By means of this, you shalll propagate yourselves;  and let this be your wish-fulfilling-cow.'
3.10 In the beginning the Lord of all beings, creating man along with the sacrifice, said:  'By this shall you prosper; this shall be the cow of plenty granting all your wants.'
3.10 In the days of yore, having created the beings together with the sacrifices, Prajapati said: 'By this you multiply. Let this be your yielder of coveted objects of desire.'
3.10 As there is the scriptural text beginning with 'The Lord of Universe' (Tai. Na., 11.3), it is justifiable to take the term Prajapati in its wider connotation and interpret it to mean Narayana who is the Lord of all beings, the creator of the universe and the Self of the universe. In the beginning, i.e., during the creation, He, the Lord of beings, saw all beings helpless by their conjunction with beginningless non-conscient matter, bereft of the distinctions of name and form, and submerged in Himself. They were incapable of attaining the major ends of human existence, being almost one with non-conscient matter. He, the supremely compassionate, with a desire to resuscitate them, created them together with sacrifice in order that they might perform sacrifices as His worship and said:  'By this sacrifice, shall you prosper,' i.e., multiply and prosper. May this sacrifice fulfil your supreme object of desire called release (Moksa) and also the other desires that are in conformity with it.

How, then, should this be done?
3.10 Saha-etc.  The lord of creatures, the Supreme Soul, created creatures, just together with actions.  It has also been declared by Him that the procreation  i.e.,  lineage of creatures is through actions alone; these alone would give them what is  desired viz., either the cycle of birth-and-death or emancipation - the cycle of birth-and-death is due to attachment and emancipation, due to the freedom from attachment.
 The sense-objects deserve to be enjoyed only by those for whom emancipation is the most important.  This is declared :
3.10 Pura, in the days of yore, in the beginning of creation; srstva, having created; prajah, the beings, the people of the three castes; saha-yajnah, together with the sacrifices; Prajapati, the creator of beings, uvaca, said; 'Anena, by this sacrifice; prasavisyadhvam, you multiply.' Prasava means origination, growth. 'You accomplish that. Esah astu, let this sacrifice be; vah, your; ista-kama-dhuk, yielder of coveted objects of desire.' That which yields (dhuk) coveted (ista) objects of desire (kama), particular results, is istakama-dhuk.
How?
3.11 With this do ye nourish the gods and may those gods nourish you; thus nourishing one another, ye shall attain to the highest good.
3.11 Worship the Powers of Nature thereby, and let them nourish you in return; thus supporting each other, you shall attain your highest welfare.
3.11. 'With this you must gratify the devas and let the devas gratify you; [thus] gratifying one another, you shall attain the highest good.'
3.11 By this, please the gods, and the gods will support you. Thus nourishing one another, may you obtain the highest good.
3.11 'You nourish the gods with this. Let those gods nourish you. Nourishing one another, you shall attain the supreme Good.'
3.11 'By this,' i.e., by this sacrifice, you propitiate the gods who form My body and have Me as their Self. For Sri Krsna will say later on:  'For I am the only enjoyer and the only Lord of Sacrifices' (9.24). Worshipped by sacrifices, may these gods, who have Me as their Self, nourish you with food, drink etc., which are reired also for their worship. Thus, supporting each other, may you attain the highest good called Moksa (release).
3.11 Devan etc.  Devas : Those that have a tendency of playing i.e.,  the deities who preside over the organs and who dwell in  the senses (or who are nothing but the sensitive faculty of the senses)  and who are well-known in the Rahasyasastra.  'You must gratify these deities by this action i.e.,  feed them compability with sense-objects.  Then, being satisfied, let these deities gratify (cause) you to have emancipation suitable exclusively to the intrinsic nature of the Self.  For, [then alone you attain] a capacity to remain in your own Self. Thus when the mutual gratification - you gratifying the [deities of the] senses, and they letting [you] be absorbed in the Self - in the uninterruped series of periods of being extrovert and of meditation, you shall soon undoubtedly attain the highest good i.e., the Supreme that is marked with the total disappearance of  [all] mutual differences.'											
 This path of the said nature  is to be followed not merely for emancipation, but also for gaining all super - human powers (or success siddhi).  This [the Lord] says -
3.11 'Bhavayata, you nourish; devan, the gods, Indra and others; anena, with this sarifice. Let te devah, those gods; bhavayantu, nourish; vah, you-make you contented with rainfall etc. Thus bhavayantah, nourishing; parasparam, one another; avapsyatha, you shall attain; the param, supreme; sreyah, Good, called Liberation, through the attainment of Knowledge;' or, 'you shall attain heaven-which is meant by param 'sreyah.' [The param sreyah (supreme Good) will either mean liberation or heaven in accordance with aspirant's hankering for Liberation or enjoyment.]
Moreover,
3.12 The gods, nourished by the sacrifice, will give you the desired objects. So, he who enjoys the objects given by the gods without offering (in return) to them, is verily a thief.
3.12 For, fed, on sacrifice, nature will give you all the enjoyment you can desire. But he who enjoys what she gives without returning is, indeed, a robber.'
3.12. The devas, gratified with necessary action will grant you the things sacrificed.  [Hence] whosoever enjoys their gifts without offering them to these devas-he is surely a thief.
3.12 The gods, pleased by the sacrifice, will bestow on you the enjoyments you desire. He who enjoys the bounty of the gods without giving them anything in return, is but a thief.
3.12 'Being nourished by sacrifices, the gods will indeed give you the coveted enjoyments. He is certainly a theif who enjoys what have been given by them without offering (these) to them.'
3.12 'Pleased by the sacrifice,' i.e., propitiated by the sacrifice, the gods, who have Me as their Self, will bestow on you the enjoyments you desire. Whatever objects are desired by persons keen on attaining release, the supreme end of human endeavour, all those will be granted by gods previously worshipped through many sacrifices. That is, whatever is solicited with more and more propitiation, all those enjoyments they will bestow on you. Whoever enjoys the objects of enjoyment granted by them for the purpose of worshipping them, without giving them their due share in return - he is verily a thief. What is called 'theft' is indeed taking what belongs to another as one's own and using it for oneself, when it is really designed for the purpose of another. The purport is that such a person becomes unfit not only for the supreme end of human endeavour, but also will go down towards purgatory (Naraka).

Sri Krsna expands the same:
3.12 Istan etc.  [The deities of]  the senses, gratified by the necessry actions,  bind [the aspirant's mind] to the state of remaining firm on some object of meditation.  Therefore when they are at work, the things,  i.e.,  the objects are granted [to him]  by none but the  [deities of the]  senses, through recollection, resolution, meditation etc., of their objects.  If these objects are not offered for the enjoyment of the deities, then it would amount to the status of a theif i.e.,  to an act of thief, because he is acting deceitfully.  Indeed it has already been declared by the Bhagavat that  'He is called a man of deluded action'.  Therefore the idea in the passage  [under study] is this :  Whosoever is desirous of attaining by easy means,  the supernatural power  [like anima etc.], or of attaining emancipation, he should enjoy the objects as and when they are brought, [and enjoy]  just with the aim of simply alliviating the impatience of the [deities of the] senses.
3.12 'Yajna-bhavitah, being nourished, i.e. being satisfied, by sacrifices; devah, the gods; dasyante hi, will indeed give, will distribute; among vah, you; the istan, coveted; bhogan, enjoyments, such as wife, childeren and cattle. Sah, he; is eva, certainly; a stenah, thief, a stealer of the wealth of gods and others; yah, who; bhunkte, enjoys, gratifies only his own body and organs; with dattan, what enjoyable things have been given; taih, by them, by the gods; apradaya, without offering (these); hyah, to them, i.e. without repaying the d  [The three kinds of d -to the gods, to the rsis (sage), and to the manes-are repaid by satisfying them through sacrifices, celibacy (including study of the Vedas, etc.), and procreation, respectively. Unless one repays these d s, he incurs sin.] to them.'
3.13 The righteous who eat the remnants of the sacrifice are freed from all sins; but those sinful ones who cook food (only) for their own sake verily eat sin.
3.13 The sages who enjoy the food that remains after the sacrifice is made are freed from all sin; but the selfish who spread their feast only for themselves feed on sin only.
3.13. The righteous persons,  who eat the remnants (objects enjoined) of the actions to be performed necessarily,  are freed from all sins.  But those who cook, intending their own selves,  are sinners and eat sin.
3.13 Pious men who eat the remnants of sacrifices are freed from all sins. But the sinful ones who cook only for their own sake earn only sin.
3.13 By becoming partakers of the remembers of sacrifices, they become freed from all sins. But the unholy persons who cook for themselves, they incur sin.
3.13 Those persons who acire food materials solely for propitiating the Supreme Person abiding as the Self of Indra and other deities, and who, after cooking them, propitiate, through them, the Supreme Person as He is, and then sustain themselves on the remnants of oblations (made for such propitiation), they alone will be free of impurities which have resulted from beginningless evil and which are inimical to the vision of the self. But they are evil-minded, who acire for selfish use the things which the Supreme Being, abiding as the Self of Indra and other deities, has granted them for worshipping Him with, and use it all on the other hand for feeding themselves - they eat only sin. Turning away from the vision of the self, they cook only for being led to Naraka (for the expiation of the sin incurred thery).

Sri Krsna says that, from the standpoint of the world as well as that of the scriptures, everything has its origin in sacrifice; and He speaks of the need for the performance of the sacrifices and of the blemish in not performing the same:
3.13 Yajnasista-etc.  Those who enjoy the pleasures of obects that have come to them on the authority of laws enjoining what is to be necessarily performed; and who enjoy them viewing  [the enjoyment]  only as a secondary (or intermediate) action and conseently as a subsidiary having no separate purpose;  and again those who enjoy the remnant of the necessary action  in the form of gratifying the group of the devas of the snese-organs-that residue of  food marked with bliss in being firmly established in their own Self - that is to say,  those who have mounted upon the Self and are desirous of enjoying objects only as a means to achieve this end - they are freed from all  faults of good and bad.  Those, who for their own selves etc. :  On the other hand, those who believe, under the  influence of ignorance, the sheer superficial enjoyment of objects as their final goal, and act with the notion  'We perform this  [act] for the sake of ourselves' - those persons alone gain the sin in the form of good and bad.
3.13 Those again, who are yajna-sista-asinah, partakers of the remnants of sacrifices, who, after making offering to the gods and others, [The panca-maha-yajnas, five great offerings, which have to be made by every householder are offerings to gods, manes, humans, creatures and rsis (sages).] are habituated to eat the remnants (of those offerings), called nectar; they, santah, by being (so); mucyante, become freed; sarva-kilbisaih, from all sins-from those sins incurred through the five things [the five things are; oven, water-pot, cutting instruments, grinding machines and broom. A householder incurs sin by killing insects etc. with these things, knowingly or unknowingly. It is atoned by making the aforesaid five offerings.], viz oven etc., and also from those others incurred owing to injury etc. caused inadvertently. Tu, but; the papah, unholy persons, who are selfish; ye, who; pacanti, cook; atma-karanat, for themselves; te, they, being themselves sinful; bhunjate, incur; agham, sin.
For the following reasons also actions should be undertaken by an eligible person. Action is definitely the cause of the movement of the wheel of the world. How? This is being answered:
3.14 From food come forth beings; from rain food is produced; from sacrifice arises rain and sacrifice is born of action.
3.14 All creatures are the product of food, food is the product of rain, rain comes by sacrifice, and sacrifice is the noblest form of action.
3.14. From food arise the things that are born;  from the rain-cloud the food arises;  from the sacrifice the rain-cloud arises;  the sacrifices arises from action;
3.14 From food arise all beings (i.e., their bodies); from rain food is produced; from sacrifice comes rain; and sacrifice springs from activity.
3.14 From food are born the creatures; the origin of food is from rainfall; rainfall originates from sacrifice; sacrifice has action as its origin.
3.14 From food arise all beings; from rain food is produced. These two facts are matters of common experience. 'From sacrifice comes rain' this is known from the scriptures such as, 'The oblations offered in fire reach the sun, and from the sun comes rain' (Manu, 6.76), and sacrifice is born out of activities in the form of collecting materials, etc., by the agent. And activity arises from 'Brahman', the body born of Prakrti.
3.14 See Comment under 3.15
3.14 It is a matter of direct perception that annat, from food, which is eaten and is transformed into blood and semen; bhavanti, are born; bhutani, the creatures. Anna-sambhavah, the origin of food; is parjanyat, from rainfall. Parjanyah, rainfall; bhavati, originates; from yajnat, from sacrifice. This accords with the Smrti, 'The oblations properly poured into fire reaches the sun. From the sun comes rain, from rain comes food, and from the sun comes rain, from rain comes food, and from that the creatures' (Ma.Sm.3.76). (Here) sacrifice means its unie [Also termed as the unseen result (adrsta).-Tr.] result. And that sacrifice, i.e. the unie result, which arises (samudbhavah) from action (karma) undertaken by the priest and the sacrificer, is karma-samudbhavah; it has action for its origin.
3.15 Know thou that action comes from Brahma and Brahma comes from the Imperishable. Therefore, the all-pervading (Brahma) ever rests in sacrifice.
3.15 All action originates in the Supreme Spirit, which is Imperishable, and in sacrificial action the all-pervading Spirit is consciously present.
3.15. Action arises from the Brahman,  you should know this;  the Brhaman arises from what does not stream forth;  therefore the all-pervading Brahman is permanently based on the sacrifice.
3.15 Know that activity springs from 'Brahman', i.e., the physical body, 'Brahman' arises from the imperishable (self); therefore the all-pervading 'Brahman' is ever established in sacrifice.
3.15 Know that actin has the veda as its origin; the Vedas has the Immutable as its source. Hence, the all-pervading Veda is for ever based on sacrifice.
3.15 Here ther term, 'Brahman' connotes the physical body consisting of modifications of the Prakrti; for the Prakrti is denoted here by the term 'Brahman', as in the scriptural text:  'From Him arises, this Brahman and this 'Brahman' becomes name, form and food' (Mun. U., 1.1.9). Here also it will be said by Sri Krsna:  'This great 'Brahman' is my womb' (14.3). Therefore, the words that 'Activity springs from 'Brahman' teaches that activity is produced by the physical body which is of the nature of the modification of Prakrti. The 'Brahman' arises from the imperishable self. Here the term, 'imperishable', indicates the individual self. The physical body, which is inhabited by the self who is satisfied by food and drink, is fit for action; hence the physical body which constitutes the instrument of activity is said to be from the imperishable. Therefore the 'all-pervading Brahman' means here the bodies of all persons of diverse kinds which are the products of Prakrti which comprises all material entities, and is hence all-pervading. They, the bodies, are established in sacrifice. The meanig is that the bodies have roots in sacrifice.
3.14-15 Annat etc.  Karma etc.  The things, that are born and are of diversified nature, arise from the food viz , the one which is of the nature of being undifferentiated objct of enjoyment, and which is somehow called by different synonyms like maya, vidya,  kala etc.  The said food also  [arises]  from the 'rain-cloud' i.e., the Self, which is of the nature of uninterrupted Consciousness.  For, the state of being an object of enjoyment  gains its existence depending on the enjoyer.  That 'rain-cloud'  too viz.,  the enjoyer,  [arises]  from the sacrifice  (yajna) i.e.,  the act  of  enjoying.   For, the state of being an enjoyer depends on the act of enjoying.  And the act of enjoying  [arises]  from action, i.e., from the strength of freedom of action-energy  (freedom in assuming any and every from).
 
The said freedom also,  though it is uninterrupted,  [arises]  due to the good touch of the Brahman  Which is full of  freedom and of forms that are conditioned and are many,  (or which is full of freedom and of many forms and is not conditioned);  and which is the Supreme  Soul,  Brahman assuming the beings  (tattvas),  viz.,   the mighty Isvara  (or Mahesvara)  [and the Sadasiva]  skipping high on It (Brahman).  That Brahman, having the rising Lord-ship  (or might)  that is pure and unvieled, arises from  what does not stream forth viz.,  the pure Supreme  Consciousness in which the entire  waves of might  and Lordship  have totally calmed  down.  Thus, the sacrifice well established  [as an exil] in this manner,  causing a six spoked wheel  to rotate , spins the [two-fold]  yarns - the yarn of emancipation by employing that part fitted with three spokes, and the yarn of  [birth-and-death]  activity by looming with the part of the  [other]  three spokes. Thus, the Brahman  Which is charming with rolling waves of wisdom and ignorance, is established on nothing but the sacrifice.
 
But certain other commentators  [interpret the passage as ] :  The food is indeed the cause of beings through its graded chages into semen verile and blood;  the food arises from the rain-cloud  through the rains;  that rains too arises from the [Vedic] sacrifice according to the principle :
 
     'The oblation offered into the [sacrificial] fire, pro-
          perly  reaches the sun etc.  (Manu. III, 76). 
 
The  sacrifice  [arises]  from the action;  the action follows the knowledge, and the knowledge  is from the Imperishable.
 
Still others [explain]  differently :  The food that is being enjoyed is the pentad of sense-objects; depending on it, the bhutas (elements) i.e.,  the sense-organs, act; the objects are of the nature of the sparkles of the Self.  Therefore,  it is only  the Self  that is being nourished by enjoying sense-objects.  Hence the all-pervading  Brahman is established in action.  For It is identical with that.
3.15 Again, [a different reading in place of this is: 'Tat ca vividham karma kuto jatamityaha, From where did those various kinds of action originate? In reply the Lord says৷৷.' Still another reading is: 'Tat ca karma brahmodbhavam iti aha, And the Lord says: That action has the Vedas as its origin.'-vide A.A., 1936, p. 116).
Astekar's reading is: Tat ca evam vidham karma kuto jatamityaha, And from where has this kind of aciton originated? The answers this.'-Tr.] viddhi, know; that karma, action; is brahmodbhavam, it has Brahma, the Veda, as its udbhavam, origin. [Here Ast. adds 'revealer'-Tr.] Further, Brahma, called the Veda, is aksara-samudbhavam, it has aksara, the Immutable, Brahman, the supreme Self, as its source. This is the meaning. Since the Veda came out, like the breath of a man, from the supreme Self Itself, called the Immutable, therefore the Veda, being the revealer of everything, is sarva-gatam, all pervading. Even though all-pervading, the Veda is nityam, for ever; pratisthitam, based; yajne, on sacrifice, because the injunctions about sacrifices predominate in it.
3.16 He who does not follow here the wheel thus set revolving, who is of sinful life, rejoicing in the senses, he lives in vain, O Arjuna.
3.16 Thus he who does not help the revolving wheel of sacrifice, but instead leads a sinful life, rejoicing in the gratification of his senses, O Arjuna, he breathes in vain.
3.16. Whosoever does not roll forward the wheel, thus set in motion in this world, he is a man of sinful life rejoicing in the senses;  and he lives in vain,  O son of  Prtha !
3.16 He who does not follow the wheel thus set in motion here, lives in sin, satisfying the senses, O Arjuna. He lives in vain.
3.16 O Partha, he lives in vain who does not follow here the wheel thus set in motion, whose life is sinful, and who indulges in the senses.
3.16 Thus this wheel is set in motion by the Supreme Person:  From food arise embodied selves which are denoted by the word 'beings':  from rain food; from sacrifice rain; sacrifice from activities which constitute the exercise of an agent; and activity from the embodied self; and again the body endowed with life from food. In this manner there is a seence which revolves like a wheel through the mutual relations of cause and effect.

Hence, He who is engaged in spiritual practice - whether one is alified for Karma Yoga or Jnana Yoga - if he does not follow, i.e., does not keep in motion the wheel which revolves in a circle through mutual relation of cause and effect - that person by not maintaining his bodily subsistence by means of the 'remainder of sacrifice,' lives in sin. His life begins in sin or develops in sin, or is of both these kinds; he lives the life of sin. Thus he is a reveller in his senses and not in his self. The senses become the pleasure-gardens of one whose mind and body are not nourished by the 'remainders of sacrifices.' Rajas and Tamas preponderate in his body. Being thus turned away from the vision of the self, he rejoices only in the enjoyment of the senses. Therefore, even if he were to attempt for the vision of the self, it will be fruitless. So he lives in vain, O Arjuna.

Sri Krsna now says that there is no need for the performance of the 'great sacrifices' etc., according to his station and stage of life, only in respect of a liberated person whose vision of the self does not depend on any external means.
3.16 Evam etc. On the other hand,  he, who does not accept as stated above, is full of sins.  For, he enjoys  only in the sense-organs and not in the Self.
3.16 O Partha, sah, he; jivati, lives; mogham, in vain; yah, who, though competent for action; na anuvartayati, does not follow; iha, here, in the world; cakram, the wheel of the world; evam, thus; pravartitam, set in motion, by God, on the basis of the Vedas and the sacrifices; aghayuh, whose life (ayuh) is sinful (agham), i.e. whose life is vile; and indriya-aramah, who indulges in the senses-who has his arama, sport, enjoyment, with objects, indriyaih, through the senses.
Therefore, the gist of the topic under discussion is that action must be undertaken by one who is alified (for action) but is unenlightened. In the verses beginning from, '(A person does not attain freedom from action by adstaining from action' (4) and ending with, 'You perform the obligatory duties৷৷.And, through inaction, even the maintenance of your body will not be possible' (8), it has been proved that before one attains fitness for steadfastness in the knowledge of the Self, it is the bounden duty of a person who is alified for action, but is not enlightened, to undertake Karma-yoga for that purpose. And then, also in the verses commencing from '(This man becomes bound) by actions other than that action meant for God' (9) and ending with 'O Partha, he lives in vain,' many reasons [Such as, that it pleases God, secures the affection of the gods, and so on.] have been incidentally stated as to why a competent person has to undertake actions; and the evils arising from their non-performance have also been emphatically declared.
Such being the conclusion, the estion arises whether the wheel thus set in motion should be followed by all, or only by one who is ignorant of the Self and has not attained to the steadfastness which is fit to be practised by the Sankhyas, the knowers of the Self, through the Yoga of Knowledge only, and which is acired by one ignorant of the Self through the means of the practice of Karma-yoga mentioned above? Either anticipating Arjuna's estion to this effect, or in order to make the meaning of the scripture (Gita) clearly understood, the Lord, revealing out of His own accord that the following substance of the Upanisads-Becoming freed from false knowledge by knowing this very Self, the Brahmanas renounce what is a compulsory duty for those having false knoweldge, viz, desire for sons, etc., and then lead a mendicant life just for the purpose of maintaining the body; they have no duty to perform other than steadfastness in the knowledge of the Self (cf. Br. 3.5.1)-has been presented here in the Gita, says:
3.17 But for that man who rejoices only in the Self, who is satisfied with the Self and who is content in the Self alone, verily there is nothing to do.
3.17 On the other hand, the soul who meditates on the Self is content to serve the Self and rests satisfied within the Self; there remains nothing more for him to accomplish.
3.17. But the man,  who simply rejoices in the Self;  and who is satisfied in the Self; and who delights in the Self alone-there exists no action for him to be performed.
3.17 But the man whose delight is only in the self, who is satisfied with the self, who rejoices in the self, for him nothing remains to be accomplished.
3.17  But that man who rejoices only in theSelf and is satisfied with the Self, and is contented only in the Self-for him there is no duty to perform.
3.17 But for him, who is not in need of the means of Jnana Yoga and Karma Yoga, who finds delight in the self on his own, i.e., who is established in the self, who is satisfied by the self alone and not by food, drink and other things which are other than the self, who rejoices in the self alone and not in pleasure gardens, garlands, sandalpaste, vocal and instrumental music etc., and for whom everything, his subsistence, nourishment and enjoyment, is the self alone - for him nothing remains to be performed for the vision of the self, because the essential nature of the self is perpetually in  his unaided vision.
3.17 See Comment under 3.19
3.17 Tu, but; that manavah, man, the sannyasin, the man of Knowledge, steadfast in the knowledge of the Self; yah, who; atmaratih eva syat, rejoices only in the Self-not in the sense objects; and atma-trptah, who is satisfied only with the Self-not with food and drink; and is santustah, contented; eva, only; atmani, in the Self; tasya, for him; na vidyate, there is no; karyam, duty [Duty with a view to securing Liberation.] to perform. [Rati, trpti and santosa, though synonymous, are used to indicate various types of pleasures. Or, rati means attachment to objects; trpti means happiness arising from contact with some particular object; and santosa means happiness in general, arising from the acisition of some coveted object only.]
All people surely feel contened by aciring an external thing. But this one, without depending on it, remains contented only with the Self; thta is to say, he remains detached from everything. The idea it that, for a man who is such a knower of the Self, there is no duty to undertake.
3.18 For him there is no interest whatever in what is done or what is not done; nor does he depend on any being for any object.
3.18 He has nothing to gain by the performance or non-performance of action. His welfare depends not on any contribution that an earthly creature can make.
3.18. No purpose is served for him by what he has done or by what he has not done.  For him there is  hardly any dependenc on any purpose among all beings.
3.18 He has no purpose to gain by work done or left undone, nor has he to rely on any end.
3.18 For him there is no concern here at all with performing action; nor any (concern) with nonperformance. Moreover, for him there is no dependence on any object to serve any purpose.
3.18 Thus, for such a one there is no purpose, i.e., nothing to be gained from work done as a means for the vision of the self, nor is he subject to any evil or calamity from work left undone, because his vision of the self does not rest on any external means. To such a person who has turned by himself away from non-intelligent matter which is different from the self, there is nothing acceptable as a purpose to be gained from the constituents of Prakrti and their products; only if there were such a purpose, there would be the need for the means of retreat therefrom. For, the adoption of the means is only for effecting such a retreat. But he is verily liberated.

Non-pursuit of the means for vision of the self is only for that person whose vision of the self no longer depends on any means. But Karma Yoga is better in gaining the vision of the self for one who is in pursuit of the means for that vision, because it is easy to perfom, because it is secure from possible error, because the contemplation of the true nature of the self is included in it, and because even for a Jnana Yogin the performance of minimum activity is necessary. For these reasons, Karma Yoga is better as a means for the vision of the Atman.
3.18 See Comment under 3.19
3.18 Moreover, tasya, for him, who rejoices in the supreme Self; na, there is no; artham, concern; eva, at all; krtena, with performing action.
Objection: In that case, let there be some evil called sin owing to non-performance!
Reply: Iha, here, in this world; na, nor is there; for him kascana, any (concern); akrtena, with nonperfromance. Certainly there is no evil in the form of incurring sin or in the form of self-destruction. Ca, moreover; asya, for him; na asti, there is no; kascit artha-vyapasrayah sarva-bhutesu, dependence on any object, from Brahma to an unmoving thing, to serve any purpose. Vyapasrayah is the same as vyapasrayanam, dependence, which is possible of being created by action promted by necessity. (For him) there is no end to gain by depending on any praticular object, due to which there can be some action for that purpose.
'You (Arjuna) are not established in this fullest realization which is comparable to a flood all around.'
3.19 Therefore without attachment, do thou always perform action which should be done; for by performing action without attachment man reaches the Supreme.
3.19 Therefore do thy duty perfectly, without care for the results, for he who does his duty disinterestedly attains the Supreme.
3.19. Therefore,  unattached always,  you should perform action that is to be performed; for,  the person,  performing action without attachment,  attains the Supreme.
3.19 Therefore without attachment do your work which ought to be done. For, a man who works without attachment attains to the Supreme.
3.19 Therefore, remaining unattached, always perform the obligatory duty, for, by performing (one's) duty without attachment, a person attains the Highest.
3.19 Therefore, considering that work has to be performed with detachment, you perform it, considering yourself a non-agent. This will be declared in the words 'with detachment' and 'which ought to be done,' meaning that one attains the Supreme by Karma Yoga itself.
3.17-19 Yas ca etc.  upto purusah.  However, for a person who rejoices in the Self and performs action simply as a [routine]  business of organs of action,  there is no difference between  (his) action and nonaciton.  That is why he inflicts  punishment on, or does favour to, every being,  not with desire for any gain for himself,  but with a conviction that it a is thing that deserves to be performed.  Therefore, just  unattached, one should perform action that  is to be performed.
3.19 Since this is so, therefore, asaktah, remaining unattached; samacara, perform; satatam, always; karyam, the obligatory; daily karma, duty; hi, for; acaran, by performing; (one's) karma, duty; asaktah, without attachment, by doing work as a dedication to God; purusah, a person; apnoti, attains; param, the Highest, Liberation, through the purification of the mind. This is meaning.
And (you should perform your duty) for the following reason also:
3.2 With this apparently perplexing speech, Thou confusest, as it were, my understanding; therefore tell me that one way for certain by which I may attain bliss.
3.2 Thy language perplexes me and confuses my reason. Therefore please tell me the only way by which I may, without doubt, secure my spiritual welfare.
3.2. You appear to perplex  my intellect with Your speech that looks confusing.  Hence tell me,  with certainty, that particular thing by which I may attain the good (emancipation).
3.2 You confuse my mind with statements that seem to contradict each other; tell me for certain that one way by which I could reach the highest good.
3.2  You bewilder my understanding, as it were, by a seemingly conflicting statement! Tell me for certain one of these by which I may attain the highest Good.
3.2 Conseently, it appears to me as if 'you confuse me with statements that seem to contradict each other.' For, firm devotion to knowledge which forms the means for the vision of the self and which is of the nature of stopping the operations of the senses on the one hand, and on the other exhortation to action which is of a nature opposite to it, i.e., knowledge, as a means to the same vision of that Atman - these statements are contradictory and confusing. Therefore tell me clearly the path following which I can take a determined course and win the Supreme Being.
3.1-2 Jyayasi etc. and Vyamisrena etc.  Action has been taught and knowledge too.  Now it is proper  [to attach] importance not to both, but only to knowledge.  Now if with the strenght of knowledge the action is to be destroyed from its very root,  according to the instruction  'The man of wisdom casts  off  [both the good and the bad action]',  then what is the autility of action ?  This is idea of  [Arjuna's] estion.
 But the Bhagavat gives the answer :
3.2 'Though the Lord speaks lucidly, still, to me who am of a dull understanding, the Lord's utterance appears to be conflicting.' 'Mohayasi, You bewilder; me, any; buddhim, understanding; iva, as it were; vyamisrena iva, by that seemingly conflicting; vakyena, statement! You have surely undertaken to dispel the confusion of my understanding; but why do You bewildered (it)? Hence I say, "You bewildered my understanding, as it were."'
However, if You [In some readings, 'tvam tu, however, you', is substituted by 'tatra, as to that'.-Tr.] think that it is impossible for a single person to pursue both Knowledge and action, which can be undertaken (only) by different persons then, that being the case, vada, tell me; niscitya, for certain; tadekam, one of these, either Knowledge or action: "This indeed is fit for Arjuna, according to his understanding, strength and situation"; yena, by which, by one of either Knowledge or action; aham, I; apnuyam, may attain; sreyah, the highest Good.'
Even if Knowledge had been spoken of at all by the Lord as being subsidiary to steadfastness in action, how then could there be the desire in Arjuna to know of only one of them, as expressed in 'Tell me one of these two?' Certainly the Lord did not say, 'I shall speak of only one among Knowledge and action, but surely not of both', owing to which, Arjuna, considering it impossible for himself to acire both, should have prayed for one only!
The answer was in accordance witht the estion:
3.20 Janaka and others attained perfection verily by action only; even with a view to the protection of the masses thou shouldst perform action.
3.20 King Janaka and others attained perfection through action alone. Even for the sake of enlightening the world, it is thy duty to act;
3.20. It was by action alone that Janaka and others had attained emancipation.  Further, at least having regard to hold the world (the society) together you should act.
3.20 Indeed by Karma Yoga alone did Janaka and others reach perfection. Even recognising its necessity for the guidance of the world, you must perform action.
3.20 For Janaka and others strove to attain Liberation through action itself. You ought to perform (your duties) keeping also in view the prevention of mankind from going astray.
3.20 It is also declared that Karma Yoga alone Janaka and others reached perfection.

Because, Karma Yoga is the best means for securing the vision of the self even for a person who is alified for Jnana Yoga, royal sages like Janaka and others, who are foremost among the Jnanins, preferred Karma Yoga as the means for attaining perfection.

Thus, having first declared previously that Karma Yoga must be practised by an aspirant for release who is alified for Karma Yoga alone, as he is unfit for Jnana Yoga, it was next stated with reasons that, even for one who is alified for Jnana Yoga, Karma Yoga is better than Jnana Yoga Now it is going to be declared (in verses 20-26) that Karma Yoga must be performed in every way by one who is virtuous.

At least for the guidance of the world, you should do work even if there is no need of it for yourself.
3.20 Karman=aiva  etc.  Therefore, janaka and others are examples  for the fact that emancipation  is even for those  who perform  action.
3.20 Hi, for; in the olden days, the leaned Ksatriyas, janakadayah, Janaka and others such as Asvapati; asthitah, strove to attain; samsiddim, Liberation; karmana eva, through action itself.
If it be that they were possessed of the fullest realization, then the meaning is that they remained established in Liberation whlile continuing, because of past momentum, to be associated with action itself-without renouncing it-with a veiw to preventing mankind from going astray. Again, if (it be that) Janaka and others had not attained fullest realization, then, they gradually became established in Liberation through action which is a means for the purification of the mind. The verse is to be explained thus.
On the other hand, if you think, 'Obligatory duty was performed even by Janaka and others of olden days who were surely unenlightened. [Ajanadbhih: This is also translated as, 'surely because they were unenlightened'.-Tr.] There by it does not follow that action has to be undertaken by somody else who has the fullest enlightenment and has reached his Goal', nevertheless, tvam, you, who are under the influence of past actions; arhasi, ought; kartum, to perform (your duties); sampasyan api, keeping also in view; loka-sangraham, [V.S.A gives the meanings of the phrase as 'the welfare of the world', and 'propitiation of mankind'.-Tr. ] the prevention of mankind from going astray; even that purpose.
By whom, and how, is mankind to be prevented from going astray? That is being stated: [In Ast. this introductory sentence is as follows:loka-samgrahah kimartham kartavyam iti ucyate.-Tr.]
3.21 Whatsoever a great man does, that the other men also do; whatever he sets up as the standard, that the world (mankind) follows.
3.21 For whatever a great man does, others imitate. People conform to the standard which he has set.
3.21. Whatsoever a great man does,  other commoners do the same;  whatever standard he sets up,  the world follows that.
3.21 Whatever a great man does, other men also do. Whichever standard he sets, the world follows it.
3.21 Whatever a superior person does, another person does that very thing! Whatever he upholds as authority, an ordinary person follows that.
3.21 Whatever 'an eminent man,' i.e., he, who is famous for his knowledge of all the scriptures and for his observance of the scriptural dictates, performs, others who have incomplete knowledge of the scriptures will also perform, following his example. With regard to any duty which is being performed with all its ancillaries by an eminent personage, the people with incomplete knowledge will do it with the same ancillaries. Therefore for the protection of the world, all acts that are appropriate to one's station and stage in life must always be performed  by an eminent man who is distinguished for his wisdom. Otherwise, the evil generated from the ruin of the large masses of the world (who neglect their duties by following his example), will bring him down, even if he were a follower of pure Jnana Yoga.
3.21 See Comment under 3.22
3.21 Yat yat, [This is according to the Ast. The G1. Pr. reads, yat yat yesu yesu.-Tr.] whatever action; a sresthah, superior person, a leader; acarati, does; itarah, another; janah, person, who follows him; does tat tat eva, that very action. Further, yat, whatever; sah, he, the superior person; kurute, upholds; as pramanam, authority, be it Vedic or secular; lokah, an ordinary person; anuvartate, follows; tat, that, i.e. he accepts that very thing as authoritative.
'If you have a doubt here with regard to the duty of preventing people from straying, then why do you not observe Me?'
3.22 There is nothing in the three worlds, O Arjuna, that should be done by Me, nor is there anything unattained that should be attained; yet I engage Myself in action.
3.22 There is nothing in this universe, O Arjuna, that I am compelled to do, nor anything for Me to attain; yet I am persistently active.
3.22. O son of Prtha !  For Me, in the three worlds there is nothing that must be done; nor is there any thing unattained  [so far]  to be attained;  and yet I exert in action.
3.22 For me, Arjuna, there is nothing in all the three worlds which ought to be done, nor is there anything unacired that ought to be acired. Yet I go on working.
3.22 In all the three worlds, O Partha, there is no duty whatsoever for Me (to fulfil); nothing remains unachieved or to be achieved. [According to S. the translation of this portion is: There is nothing unattained that should be attained.-Tr.] (Still) do I continue in action.
3.22 For Me, who is the Lord of all, who has all desires fulfilled, who is omniscient, whose will is always true, and who, at My own will, remains in the three worlds in the forms of gods, men and such other beings, there is nothing whatever to achieve. Therefore though there is for Me nothing 'unacired', i.e., nothing yet to be acired by work, I go on working for the protection of the world.
3.21-22 Yad  yad acarati  etc.  Na me etc.  The Bhagavat cities Himself  as an example  to illustrate  the idea  that  to favour the world is the [only]  purpose for such a person to exert in action,  eventhough he has already attained whatever is to be attained,  and is fully satisfied in his mind.
3.22 O Partha, na asti, there is no; kartavyam, duty; kincana, whatsoever; me, for Me (to fulfill); even trisu lokesu, in all the three worlds. Why? There is na anavaptam, nothing (that remains) unachieved; or avaptavyam, to be achieved. Still varte eva, do I continue; karmani, in action.
3.23 For, should I not ever engage Myself in action, unwearied, men would in every way follow My path, O Arjuna.
3.23 For were I not to act without ceasing, O prince, people would be glad to do likewise.
3.23. For,  if  I were ever not at work unwearied,  all men would follow My path,  O son of  Prtha !
3.23 If I did not continue to work unwearied, O Arjuna, men would follow my path.
3.23 For, O Partha, if at any time I do not continue [Ast. and A.A. read varteya instead of varteyam.-Tr.] vigilantly in action, men will follow My path in ever way.
3.23 If I, the Lord of all, whose will is always true, whose sport consists in creation, sustentation and dissolution of universe at My will, even though I am born at My pleasure as a man to help the world - if, I thus incarnating in the family of Vasudeva who is the foremost among virtuous men, did not contine to work unwearied at all times suitable to that family, then, these men with incomplete knowledge would follow My path, thinking that the way adopted by the son of virtuous Vasudeva alone is the real way. And in place of winning the self, they would go to Naraka because of their failure to do what ought to be done and also because of the sin arising from non-performance of duty.
3.23 See Comment under 3.25
3.23 Again, O Partha, yadi, if; jatu, at any time; aham, I; an, do not; varteyam, continue; atandritah, vigilantly, untiringly; karmani, in action; manusyah, men: anuvartante, willl follow; mama, My; vartma, path; sarvasah, in every way, I being the Highest.
And if that be so, what is the harm? In reply the Lord says: [Ast. omits this sentence completely.-Tr.]
3.24 These worlds would perish if I did not perform action; I should be the author of confusion of castes and destruction of these beings.
3.24 And if I were to refrain from action, the human race would be ruined; I should lead the world to chaos, and destruction would follow.
3.24. These worlds would perish if I were not to perform action; and I  would be a cause of confusion;  I would destroy these people.
3.24 If I do not do work, these men would be lost; and I will be causing chaos in life and thery ruining all these people.
3.24  These worlds will be ruined if I do not perform action. And I shall become the agent of intermingling (of castes), and shall be destroying these beings.
3.24 If I do not do the work suitable to My station in life, likewise all the virtuous men also, neglecting their duties by following My example, would be destroyed on account of not performing their duties. That is, they will become lost. Thus I would be bringing about chaos among all virtuous men on account of My failure to conduct Myself as prescribed in the scriptures. Therefore I would be destroying all these people. Even so, if you, Arjuna, a son of Pandu and a brother of Yudhisthira and the foremost of the virtuous, claim to be alified for Jnana Yoga, then the virtuous aspirants, who do not know everything and who follow your way, without knowing their own competency, would give up practising Karma Yoga and will be lost. Therefore work should be done by one who is recognised as learned and worthy.
3.24 See Comment under 3.25
3.24 Cet, if; aham, I; na kuryam, do not perform; karma, action; all ime, these; lokah, worlds; utsideyuh, will be ruined, owing to the obsence of work responsible for the maintenance of the worlds. Ca, and, futher; syam, I shall become; karta, the agent; sankarasya, of intermingling (of castes). Conseently, upahanyam, I shall be destroying; imah, these; prajah, beings. That is to say, I who am engaged in helping the creatures, shall be destroying them. This would be unbefitting of Me, who am God.
'On the other, if, like Me, you or some one else possesses the conviction of having attained Perfection and is a knower of the Self, it is a duty of such a one, too, to help others even if there be no obligation on his own part.'
3.25 As the ignorant men act from attachment to action, O Bharata (Arjuna), so should the wise act without attachment, wishing the welfare of the world.
3.25 As the ignorant act, because of their fondness for action, so should the wise act without such attachment, fixing their eyes, O Arjuna, only on the welfare of the world.
3.25. [Therefore] just as the unwise persons, being attached to action, do, O son of Prtha,  so the wise should perform, [But] being unattached and desiring to hold the world  together.
3.25 Just as the ignorant, attached to their work, act, O Arjuna, so too the learned should act without any attachment, and only for the welfare of the world.
3.25 O scion of the Bharata dynasty, as the unelightened poeple act with attachment to work, so should the enlightened person act, without attachment, being desirous of the prevention of people from going astray.
3.25 'The ignorant' are those people who do not know the entire truth about the self; 'attached to their work' means they are inseparably yoked to work. Because of their incomplete knowledge of the self, they are not alified for Jnana Yoga which is of the nature of practising knowledge of the self. They are alified for Karma Yoga only. As they should practise Karma Yoga for the vision of the self in the same manner Karma Yoga should be practised by one who is recognised as virtuous, who is unattached to work by reason of the vision of the self, and who wishes that his conduct should give guidance to others in virtuous conduct. In this way he should protect the world from chaos by his example. Such a person, even though alified for Jnana Yoga, should practice Karma Yoga.
3.23-25 Yadi etc.  upto  loka-sangraham.  Further, if a well-in-formed person were to abandon action,  that would create in the society,  a split for bad in the form of being  illrooted, becuase of the binding force - viz.,  the regard for a particular well-known  theroy-being loosened.  For,  they are able neither to cast off their tendency of action nor to accupy the tradition (or stream) of wisdom.  Conseently they become weak.					
 Because these (common men)  are not purified correct knowledge, therefore to break  i.e., to shake their mind would be highly harmful for them.  Hence, for their benefit,  one should not disturb their mind.  This [the Lord]  says :
3.25 O scion of the Bharata dynasty, yatha, as; some avidvamsah, unenlightened poele; kurvanti, act. saktah, with attachment; karmani, to work, (thinking) 'The reward of this work will accrue to me'; tatha, so; should vidvan, the enlightened person, the knower of the Self; kuryat, act; asaktah, without attachment, remaining unattached. [Giving up the idea of agentship and the hankering for the rewards of actions to oneself.] Whay does he (the enlightened person) act like him (the former)? Listen to that: Cikirsuh, being desirous of achieving; lokasamgraham, prevention of people from going astray.
'Neither for Me who am a knower of the Self, nor for any other (knower of the Self) who wants thus prevent people from going astray, is there any duty apart from working for the welfare of the world. Hence, the following advice is being given to such a knower of the Self:'
3.26 Let no wise man unsettle the mind of ignorant people who are attached to action; he should engage them in all actions, himself fulfilling them with devotion.
3.26 But a wise man should not perturb the minds of the ignorant, who are attached to action; let him perform his own actions in the right spirit, with concentration on Me, thus inspiring all to do the same.
3.26. Let the wise master of Yoga fulfil (or destroy) all actions by performing them all, and let him not creat any disturbance in the mind of the ingnorant persons attached to action.
3.26 He should not bewilder the minds of the ignorant who are attached to work; rather himself performing work with devotion, he should cause others to do so.
3.26  The enlightened man should not create disturbance in the beliefs of the ignorant, who are attached to work. Working, while himself remaining deligen [Some translate yuktah as, 'in the right manner'. S. takes it in the sense of Yoga-yuktah, merged in yoga.-Tr.], he should make them do [Another reading is yojayet, meaning the same as josayet.-Tr.] all the duties.
3.26 Do not bewilder the minds of ignorant aspirants by saying that there is, besides Karma Yoga, another way to the vision of the self. They cannot practise Jnana Yoga on account of their incomplete knowledge of the self, and attachment to action. They are alified for Karma Yoga because of their being fit only for activity on account of the subtle impressions of their beginningless Karma. What then follows from this?  It is this:  Even though one is alified for Jnana Yoga because of the complete knowledge of the self, one should do work, holding the view as said previously, that Karma Yoga by itself without Jnana Yoga is an independent means for the vision of the self. He should thus generate love for all types of activity among those who do not know the complete truth.

Sri Krsna declares (in the verses 27 to 30) the way in which the self is to be contemplated on as not being an agent as reired by Karma Yoga, after demonstrating the difference between the enlightened and unenlightened among those practising Karma Yoga.
3.26 Na  buddhi-etc.  Himself knowing in this way, let him perform actions and let him not disturb  the minds of common men.					
 [In the last verse]  reference is made  'of  the ignorant person'.  [The Lord]  now demonstrates  their ignorance -
3.26 Vidvan the enlightened man; na janayet, should not create; buddhi-bhedam, disturbance in the beliefs-disturbance in the firm belief, 'This has to be done; and the result of this action is to be reaped by me'; ajnanam, of the ignorant, of the non-discriminating one; karma-sanginam, who are attached to work. But what should he do? Himself samacaran, working, performing those very activities of the ignorant; yuktah, while remaining diligent; josayet, he should make them do; sarva-karmani, all the duties.
How does an anillumined, ignorant person be come attached to actions? In reply the Lord says:
3.27 All actions are wrought in all cases by the alities of Nature only. He whose mind is deluded by egoism thinks, "I am the doer."
3.27 Action is the product of the Qualities inherent in Nature. It is only the ignorant man who, misled by personal egotism, says: I am the doer.'
3.27. The actions are performed part by part,  by the Strands of the Prakrti;  [yet] the person, having his self  (mind) deluded with egoity,  imagines 'I am [alone] the doer'.
3.27 Actions are being performed in every way by the Gunas of Prakrti. He whose nature is deluded by egoism, thinks, 'I am the doer.'
3.27 While actions are being done in every way by the gunas (alities) of Nature, one who is deluded by egoism thinks thus: 'I am the doer.'
3.27 It is the Gunas of Prakrti like Sattva, Rajas etc., that perform all the activities appropriate to them. But the man, whose nature is deluded by his Ahankara, thinks, 'I am the doer of all these actions.' Ahankara is the mistaken conception of 'I' applied to the workings of Prakrti which is not the 'I'. The meaning is that it is because of this (Ahankara), that one who is ignorant of the real nature of the self, thinks, 'I am the doer' with regard to the activities that are really being done by the Gunas of Prakrti.
3.27 Prakreh  etc.  Indeed the actions are performed by the Strands,  Sattva etc.,  belonging to the Prakrti.  But the fool unnecessarily binds himself  by wrongly comprehending 'I' am the doer'.
3.27 Karmani kriyamanani, while actions, secular and scriptural, are being done; sarvasah, in ever way; gunaih, by the gunas, (i.e.) by the modifications in the form of body and organs; (born) prakrteh, of Nature-Nature, (otherwise known as) Pradhana [Pradhana, Maya, the Power of God.], being the state of eilibrium of the three alities of sattva, rajas and tamas; ahankara-vimudha-atma, one who is deluded by egoism; manyate, thinks; iti, thus; 'Aham karta, I am the doer.'
Ahankara is self-identification with the aggregate of body and organs. He whose atma, mind, is vimudham, diluded in diverse ways, by that (ahankara) is ahankara-vimudha-atma. He who imagines the characteristics of the body and organs to be his own, who has self-identification with the body and the organs, and who, through ignorance, believes the activities to be his own-, he thinks, 'I am the doer of those diverse activities.'
3.28 But he who knows the Truth, O mighty-armed (Arjuna), about the divisions of the alities and (their) functions, knowing that the Gunas as senses move amidst the Gunas as the sense-objects, is not attached.
3.28 But he, O Mighty One, who understands correctly the relation of the Qualities to action, is not attached to the act for he perceives that it is merely the action and reaction of the Qualities among themselves.
3.28. But, O mighty-armed one, the knower of the real nature of the divisions of the Strands and of their [respective] divisions of  work,  realises :  'The Strands are at their [respective] purposes'  And hence he is not attached.
3.28 But he who knows the truth about the division of the Gunas and works, O mighty-armed one, through his knowledge that 'Gunas operate on their products,' is not attached.
3.28 But, O mighty-armed one, the one who is a knower of the facts about the varieties of the gunas (alities) and actions does not become attached, thinking thus: 'The organs rest (act) on the objects of the organs.'
3.28 But he who knows the truth about the divisions of the Gunas and their actions - namely, about the division among Sattva etc., on the one hand, and the divisions among their respective functionings on the other hand - it is he who, realising that Gunas, i.e., Sattva etc., are operating on their own products, is not attached to the actions of the Gunas, being convinced, 'I am not the doer.'
3.28 Tattvavit  tu etc.   On the other hand, the  knower of  the real  nature of divisions of the Strands and of their  actions,  sets himself  free by viewing  'The Prakrti acts;  what  comes to men ?'							
 The ignorant men have been described as being attached to action (above III,  26).  That  attachment [of theirs,  the Lord]  demonstrates :
3.28 Tu, but, on the other hand; he who is a knower, tattva-vit, a knower of the facts;-knower of what kinds of facts?-guna-karma-vibhagayoh, about the varieties of the gunas and actions, i.e. a knower of the diversity of the gunas and the diversity of acitons; [Guna-vibhaga means the products of Prakrti which consists of the three gunas. They are the five subtle elements, mind, intellect, ego, five sensory organs, five motor organs and five objects (sound etc.) of the senses. Karma-vibhaga means the varieties of inter-actions among these.-Tr.] na sajjate, does not become attached; iti matva, thinking thus; 'Gunah, the gunas in the form of organs;-not the Self-vartante, rest (act); gunesu, on the gunus in the form of objects of the organs.'
3.29 Those deluded by the alities of Nature are attached to the functions of the alities. The man of perfect knowledge should not unsettle the foolish one who is of imperfect knowledge.
3.29 Those who do not understand the Qualities are interested in the act. Still, the wise man who knows the truth should not disturb the mind of him who does not.
3.29. Men,  completely deluded by the Strands of the Prakrti,  are attached to the actions of the Strands.  Man, who know fully, should not confuse them, the dullard,  who do not know fully.
3.29 Those who are deluded by the Gunas of Prakrti are attached to the works of the Gunas. But he who knows the whole truth should not unsettle the ignorant who do not know the whole truth.
3.29 Those who are wholly deluded by the gunas of Nature become attached to the activities of the gunas. The knower of the All should not disturb those of dull intellect, who do not know the All.
3.29 Those who 'do not know the whole truth' are those persons who are trying for the vision of the self but are deluded about the nature of the self, not knowing, on account of their involvement in Prakrti, that actions proceed from the Gunas of Prakrti. They are therefore attached to the actions of the Gunas - i.e., only to actions forming part of Karma Yoga. They are alified only for Karma Yoga. One who knows the complete truth should not, by himself remaining a practitioner of Jnana Yoga, unsettle those persons who are ignorant and who do not know the complete truth. Those, the ignorant, who tend to follow the behaviour of a great man, when they see him transcend Karma Yoga, will have their minds shaken from Karma Yoga. Thus, the great man, should himself remain established in Karma Yoga, while having the full knowledge of the true nature of the self and contemplating on the self as not being the agent. Thus he should demonstrate that Karma Yoga by itself is an autonomous means for the vision of the self. He should create in those who do not know the complete truth the love of Karma Yoga.

The superiority of this Karma Yoga over Jnana Yoga even for those who are alified for Jnana Yoga has already been stated. Therefore one who is a respected person of note should follow this Karma Yoga alone for the good of the world. The method of performing actions after attributing agency to the Gunas by discerning the nature of the self as different from Prakrti, has been taught. The agency of the self is not produced by the inherent nature of the self, but by its contact with the Gunas. Hence by discriminating between what is obtained by contact and not obtained when there is no contact, it has to be understood that this agency is due to the Gunas or Prakrti.

Now it is said that the agency of works, first attributed to Gunas, ultimately go to the Supreme Person who is the Self of all. It is done by discerning that the nature of the individual self is one of subservience to the Supreme Person, as they constitute His body:
3.29 Prakrteh etc.  The deluded persons,  under the influence  of the Strands, Sattva  etc., are attached  to the actions performed by the Sattva etc.,  which are the Strands belonging to the Prakrti.						
 In the same context  (III, 26)  it has been said :  'Therefore being a master of  Yoga,  let  [the wise]  fulfil actions'.  How to do that ?  [The Lord] clarifies :
3.29 Those again, guna-sammudhah, who are wholly deluded by the gunas; prakrteh, of Nature; sajjante, become attached; guna karmasu, to the activities of the gunas, thining, 'We do actions for results.' Krtsna-vit, the knower of the All, one who is himself a knower of the Self; na vicalayet, should not disturb; tan, those who are attached to actions; (who are) mandan, of dull intellect; akrtsnavidah, who do not know the All, who are all attention on the results of actions. Unsetting of beliefs is itself the disturbance. That he should not do. This is the idea.
Again, in what manner should duties be under-taken by a seeker after Liberation who is not enlightened, who is alified for actions (rites and duties)? As to this, the answer is being stated:
3.3 The Blessed Lord said  In this world there is a twofold path, as I said before, O sinless one; the path of knowledge of the Sankhyas and the path of action of the Yogins.
3.3 Lord Shri Krishna replied: In this world, as I have said, there is a twofold path, O Sinless One! There is the Path of Wisdom for those who meditate, and the Path of Action for those who work.
3.3. The Bhagavat said  The two-fold path in this world-[the one] with Yoga of knowledge for men of reflection [and the other] with Yoga of action for men of Yoga-has been declared to be one by Me formerly,  O sinless one !
3.3 The Lord said  In this world a two-fold way was of yore laid down by Me, O sinless one:  by Jnana Yoga for the Sankhyas and by Karma Yoga for the Yogins.
3.3 The Blessed Lord said  O unblemished one, two kinds of steadfastness in this world were spoken of by Me in the days of yore-through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization; through the Yoga of Action for the yogis.
3.3 The Lord said  You have not properly understood what I taught you before. In this world, full of people with varying degrees of alifications, I have taught in the days of yore two ways, that of knowledge (Jnana Yoga) and that of works, according to the alifications of aspirants. There is no contradiction in this. It is not possible for all people of the world in whom the desire for release has arisen, to become capable immediately for the practice of Jnana Yoga. But he who performs the worship of the Supreme Person without desire for fruits and thery gets completely rid of inner impurities and keeps his senses unagitated - he becomes competent for the path of knowledge.

That all activities are for performing the worship of the Supreme Person will be taught in the Gita verse, 'He from `whom the activities of all beings arise and by whom all this is pervaded - by worshipping Him with his duty man reaches perfection' (18.46). Earlier also performance of activities without any attachment to the fruits is enjoined by the verse beginning with. 'You have the right to work alone ৷৷.' (2.47). Next for those whose intellect has been redeemed by this kind of discipline, is enjoined Jnana Yoga by the words, 'When a man renounces all the desires ৷৷.' (2.55).

Conseently, firm devotion to Jnana Yoga is taught only to the Sankhyas, i.e., those persons who are competent to follow the discipline of the knowledge of the self, and Karma Yoga to Yogins, i.e., to those competent for the path of work. Sankhya means Buddhi and those who are endowed with the Buddhi (intellectual or mental disposition) having only the self for its object, are Sankhyans. Therefore those who are not fit for this are alified for Karma Yoga. Those who are possessed of Buddhi which is agitated by objects of the senses, are the persons alified for Karma Yoga, whereas those whose Buddhi is not thus agitated, are alified for Jnana Yoga. Therefore nothing contradictory and confusing is taught.

It is said in the next stanza that Jnana Yoga is difficult to practise all at once, even when the desire for release arises in any worldy person:
3.3 Loke etc.  In the world, this twofold path is well known.  Knowledge is important for men of reflection and action for men of Yoga.  But that path has been declared by Me to be only one.  For, the Consciousness consists predominantly of knowledg and action.  This is the idea here. 					
 For this [the Lord continues] -
3.3 Anagha, O unblemished one, O sinless one; [This word of address suggests that Arjuna is alified to receive the Lord's instruction.] dvividha, two kinds of ; nistha, steadfastness, persistence in what is undertaken; asmin loke, in this world, for the people of the three castes who are alified for following the scriptures; prokta, were spoken of; maya, by Me, the omniscient God, who had revealed for them the traditional teachings of the Vedas, which are the means of securing prosperity and the highest Goal; pura, in the days of yore, in the beginning the creation, after having brought into being the creatures.
Now then, which is that steadfastness of two kinds? In answer the Lord says: The steadfastness jnanayogena, through the Yoga of Knowledge-Knowledge itself being the Yoga [Here jnana, Knowledge, refers to the knowledge of the supreme Reality, and Yoga is used in the derivative sense of 'that (Knowledge) through which one gets united with Brahman'.]-; had been stated sankhyanam, for the men of realization-those possessed of the Knowledge arising from the discrimination with regard to the Self and the not-Self, those who have espoused monasticism from the stage of Celibacy; itself, those to whom the entity presented by the Vedantic knowledge has become fully ascertained (see Mu. 3.2.6)-,the monks who are known as the parama-hamsas, those who are established in Brahman alone. And the steadfastness karma-yogena, through the Yoga of Action-action itself being the Yoga [Yoga here means 'that through which one gets united with, comes to have, prosperity', i.e. such actions as go by the name of righteousness and are prescribed by the scriptures.] had been stated yoginam, for the yogis, the men of action (rites and duties). This is the idea.
Again, had it been intended or stated or if it will be stated in the Gita by the Lord-and if it has also been so stated in the Vedas-that Knowledge and action are to be practised in combination by one and the same person for attaining the same human Goal, why then should He here tell His dear supplicant Arjuna, that steadfastness in either Knowledge or action is to be practised only by different persons who are respectively alified? If, on the other hand, it be supposed that the Lord's idea is, 'After hearing about both Knowledge and action, Arjuna will himself practise them (in combination); but, to others, I shall speak of them as being meant to be pursued by different persons', then the Lord would be imagined to be unreliable, being possessed of likes and dislikes! And that is untenable.
So, from no point of view whatsoever can there be a combination of Knowledge and action. And what has been said by Arjuna regarding superiority of Wisdom over action, that stands confirmed for not having been refuted; and (it also stands confirmed) that steadfastness in Knowledge is suitable for being practised by monks alone. And from the statement that they (Knowledge and action) are to be followed by different persons, it is understood that this has the Lord's approval.
Noticing that Arjuna had become dejected under the impression, 'You are urging me to that very action which is a source of bondage', and was thinking thus, 'I shall not undertake action', the Lord said, 'Na karmanam anarambhat, not by abstaining from action,' etc.
Or:-When steadfastness in Knowledge and steadfastness in action become incapable of being pursued simultaneously by one and the same person owing to mutual contradiction, then, since it may be concluded that they become the cause of attaining the human Goal independently of each other, therefore, in order to show-that the steadfastness in action is a means to the human Goal, not independently, but by virtue of being instrumental in securing steadfastness in Knowledge; and that, on the other hand, steadfastness in Knowledge, having come into being through the means of steadfastness in action, leads to the human Goal independently without anticipating anything else-,the Lord said:
3.30 Renouncing all actions in Me, with the mind centred in the Self, free from hope and egoism, and from (mental) fever, do thou fight.
3.30 Therefore, surrendering thy actions unto Me, thy thoughts concentrated on the Absolute, free from selfishness and without anticipation of reward, with mind devoid of excitement, begin thou to fight.
3.30. Renouncing all actions in Me, with mind that concentrates on the Self; being free from the act of reesting and from the sense of  possession; and [conseently being free from [mental] fever;  you should fight.
3.30 Surrendering all your actions to Me with a mind focussed on the self, free from desire and selfishness, fight with the heat of excitement abated.
3.30 Devoid of the fever of the soul, engage in battle by dedicating all actions to Me, with (your) mind intent on the Self, and becoming free from expectations and egoism.
3.30 Do all prescribed acts such as war etc., (here a duty) free from desire or selfishness and devoid of fear, with a mind focussed on the self. Surrender all acts to Me, the Lord of all, who constitutes the inner pervading Self of all beings. 'Adhyatma-cetas' is that mind which is focussed on the self by knowledge of the essential nature of the self as declared in hundreds of Vedic texts. That this individual self constitutes the body of the Supreme Self and is actuated by Him, is taught by Sruti texts like:  'He who has entered within, is the ruler of all beings and is the Self of all' (Tai. Ar., 3.11), 'Him who has entered inside and is the doer' (Ibid., 3.23), 'He who, dwelling in the self, is within the self, whom the Self does not know, whose body is the self, who controls the self from within - He is your internal ruler and Immortal Self' (Br. U., 3.7.22). Smrti texts also speak in the same manner:  'Him who is the ruler of all' (Manu, 12.122). Sri Krsna will say later on: 'And I am seated in the hearts of all; from Me are memory, knowledge and the faculty of reason' (15.15); 'The Lord, O Arjuna, lives in the heart of everything causing them to spin round and round by His power, as if set on a wheel' (18.61). Hence, dedicate to Me, the Supreme Person, all actions considering them as done by Me, by contemplating on the self as actuated by Me by reason of Its constituting My body. And do every thing, considering the actions as My worship only; becoming free from desire for fruits and therefore free from selfishness as regards actions, engage in acts like war etc., devoid of 'fever', i.e., the excitement caused by passions like anger.

Contemplate that the Supreme Person, Lord of all, Principal of all, gets done His own works only for the purpose of getting Himself worshipped with His own instruments, namely, the individual selves which belong to Him and are His agents. Become free from selfish attachment to action. Also be free from the feverish concern originating from such thoughts as 'What will become of me with an ancient, endless accumulation of evil arising from beginningless time?'  Perform Karma Yoga with ease, for the Supreme Person Himself, worshipped by acts, will free you from bondage. His Lordship and Principalship over all are settled by Sruti texts like:  'Him who is the supreme and great Lord of lords, Him the Supreme Divinity of divinities' (Sve. U., 6.7), 'The Lord of the Universe' (Tai. Na., 11.3), 'The Supreme Ruler of rulers' (Sve. U., 6.6-7). Isvaratva is the same as Sesitva, which means controllership.

Sri Krsna declares that this alone is the essential meaning of the Upanisads:
3.30 Mayi etc.  You should perform  the  worldly act of fighting a war,  being desirous of doing favour for the world;  renouncing all actions in Me with the thought  'I am not the doer [of any act]'; and being convinced  'None but the Sovereign Supreme Lord is the doer of all acts,  and I am nobody'.
3.30 Vigata-jvarah, devoid of the fever of the soul, i.e. being free from repentance, without remorse; yuddhyasva, engage in battle; sannyasya, by dedicating; sarvani, all; karmani, actions; mayi, to Me, who am Vasudeva, the omniscient supreme Lord, the Self of all; adhyatma-cetasa, with (your) mind intent on the Self-with discriminating wisdom, with this idea, 'I am an agent, and I work for God as a servant'; and further, bhutva, becoming; nirasih, free from expectations ['Free from expectations of results for yourself']; and nirmamah, free from egoism. You from whom has vanished the idea, '(this is) mine', are nirmamah.
3.31 Those men who constantly practise this teaching of Mine with faith and without cavilling, they too are freed from actions.
3.31 Those who always act in accordance with My precepts, firm in faith and without cavilling, they too are freed from the bondage of action.
3.31. Those who constantly follow this doctrine of Mine-such men, with faith and without finding fault [in it],  are freed from [the results of] all actions.
3.31 Those men who, full of faith, ever practise this teaching of Mine and those who receive it without cavil - even they are released from Karma.
3.31 Those men who ever follow this teaching of Mine with faith and without cavil, they also become freed from actions.
3.31 There are those persons who are alified to understand the Sastras and decide for themselves what is My doctrine, and follow them accordingly; there are others who are full of faith in the meaning of the Sastras without however practising it. And there are still others who, even though devoid of faith, do not cavil at it, saying that the true meaning of the Sastras cannot be this, i.e., they do not find any blemish pertaining to the Sastras which possess great alities. All these persons are freed from Karmas which are there from beginningless time and which cause bondage. By the term, api (even) in 'te pi karmabhih' ('even they from Karmas'), these men are divided into three groups. The meaning is that those who, even if they do not act upon the meaning but still believe in this meaning of the Sastras and do not cavil at it, will be cleansed of their evil by their faith and freedom from fault-finding. For, if they have faith they will, before long, take to the practice of this very meaning of the Sastras and be freed.

Sri Krsna now speaks of the evil that will befall those who do not practice this instruction of the Upanisads, i.e., those who are faithless and who cavil at it.
3.31 See Comment under 3.32
3.31 Ye, those; manavah, men; who (nityam, ever;) anutisthanti, follow accordingly; me matam, My teaching- this teaching of Mine, viz that 'duty must be performed', which has been stated with valid reasoning; sraddhavantah, with faith; and anasuyantah, without cavil, without detracing Me, Vasudeva, the Teacher [Here Ast. adds 'parama, supreme'-Tr.]; te api, they also, who are such; mucyante, become freed; karmabhih, from actions called the righteous and the unrighteous.
3.32 But those who carp at My teaching and do not practise it, deluded of all knowledge, and devoid of discrimination, know them to be doomed to destruction.
3.32 But they who ridicule My word and do not keep it, are ignorant, devoid of wisdom and blind. They seek but their own destruction.
3.32. But those who, finding fault, do not follow this doctrine of  Mine-be sure that these men to be highly deluded in all  [branches of]  knowledge and to be lost and brainless.
3.32 But those who calumniate it, and those who do not practise this teaching of Mine - know them to be absolutely senseless and devoid of all knowledge, and therefore lost.
3.32 But those who, decaying [Finding fault where there is none.] this, do not follow My teaching, know them-who are deluded about all knoweldge [Knowledge concerning the alified and the un-alified Brahman.] and who are devoid of discrimination-to have gone to ruin.
3.32 But those who do not follow this view of Mine, namely, that the self has Me for Its support, is subservient to Me and is actuated by Me only, i.e., those who do not perform all acts contemplating in this way as also those who have no faith in the meaning of the Sastras and calumniate them - know them to be extremely deluded and devoid of reasoning and knowledge and conseently completely lost. For, the function of the mind is the determination of the real nature of things, and in its absence, those mentioned above are devoid of reason, and therefore apostates in knowledge and extremely deluded in all ways.

For one united with the Prakrti (body), the sense of agency results from the preponderance of the Gunas of Prakrti. But this agency really rests with the Supreme Person. Contemplating thus, Karma Yoga alone should be practised by both - those who are competent for Karma Yoga only and those who are competent for Jnana Yoga. The implied superiority of Karma Yoga has the following justifications; it is easy to perform, free from liability to lapse, and independent of anything else; it comprises the knowledge of the self also within its scope. On the other hand Jnana Yoga is difficult to practise, is not free from the liability to lapse, leaves one dependent on actions for the sustenance of the body etc. And for a distinguished perosn, this (i.e., Karma Yoga) is especially what ought to be practised.

Next, till the end of this chapter, it is explained how Jnana Yoga, being difficult, is liable to lead to lapses.
3.31-32 Ye Me etc.  Ye tvetat etc.  Taking shelter in this doctrine whosoever performs any action,  it does not bind  him.  On the other hand those,  who have no faith is this knowledge,  are lost totally;  for,  they are constantly  socked in the fear of birth,  death etc.
3.32 Tu, but; ye, those who are the opposite of them (the former); who abhyasuyantah, decrying; etat, this instruction of Mine; na, do not; anutisthanti, follow; me, My; matam, teaching, they are deluded in various ways with respect to all knowledge. Viddhi, know; tan, them; sarva-jnana-vimudhan, who are deluded about off knowledge; acetasah, who are devoid of discrimination; nastan, to have gone to ruin.
'For what reason, again, do they not follow your teachings, perform duties that are not theirs and not follow their own duties? How is it that by remaining opposed to You, they do not fear the evil which will arise from transgressing Your ?ndments? As to that, the Lord says:
3.33 Even a wise man acts in accordance with his own nature; beings will follow Nature; what can 
restraint do?
3.33 Even the wise man acts in character with his nature; indeed, all creatures act according to their natures. What is the use of compulsion then?
3.33. Even a man of knowledge acts in conformity to his own Prakrti,  the elements go [back]  to the Prakrti;  [and]  what will the restraint avail ?
3.33 Even the man of knowledge acts according to his nature; all beings follow their nature. What will repression do?
3.33 Even a man of wisdom behaves according to his own nature. Being follow (their) nature. What can restraint do?
3.33 Such and such is the nature of the self, which is different from the Prakrti - this has to be always contemplated upon:  thus declare the Sastras. Even a person who knows this, acts in relation to material objects only according to his own nature, i.e., guided by his old subtle impressions. How is this? 'All beings follow their nature.' Beings in conjunction with non-conscient matter, all follow only subtle impressions which have continued to come from time immemorial. What can the control enjoined by Sastras, do to these beings who follow their subtle impressions?

Sri Krsna expounds the way by which individuals are overpowered to follow their respective natures:
3.33 Sadrsam etc.  There is hardly any difference in the wordly  activities like eating etc., of  him who is a man of wisdom.  But he too acts only in conformity to the Sattva, etc., just knowing in this manner :  'Because the elements like the Earth etc.  get absorbed into the prakrti;  and the Self is also a non-doer and ever-freed; therefore the erradication of birth etc., are for whose sake ?'
 Then how can there be bondage at all [for a man of worldly life] ?  That is as follows, it is said :
3.33 Api, even; jnanavan, a man of wisdom-what to speak of a fool!; cestate, behaves; Sadrsam, according to;-what? svasyah, his own; prakrteh, nature. Nature means the impressions of virtue, vice, etc. [Also, knowledge, desires, and so on.] acired in the past (lives) and which become manifest at the commencement of the present life. All creatures (behave) according to that only. Therefore, bhutani, beings; yanti, follow; (their) prakrtim, nature. Nigrahah kim karisyati, what can restraint do, be it from Me or anybody else?
If all beings behave only according to their own nature-and there is none without his nature-, then, since there arises the contingency of the scriptures becoming purposeless owing to the absence of any scope for personal effort, therefore the following is being stated:
3.34 Attachment and aversion for the objects of the senses abide in the senses; let none come under their sway; for, they are his foes.
3.34 The love and hate which are aroused by the objects of sense arise from Nature; do not yield to them. They only obstruct the path.
3.34. [For a man of worldly life]  there are likes and dislikes clearly fixed with regard to the objects of each of his sense organs.  These are the obstacles for him.  [The wise] would not come under the control of these.
3.34 Each sense has fixed attachment to, and aversion for, its corresponding object. But no one should come under their sway; for they are his foes.
3.34 Attraction and repulsion are ordained with regard to the objects of all the organs. One should not come under the sway of these two, because they are his adversaries.
3.34 An unavoidable attraction has been fixed for organs of sense like ear towards the objects like sound, and for organs of action like that of tongue towards their objects like tasty food. This longing is in the form of desire to experience these objects, which is caused by old subtle impressions. When their experience is thwarted, an unavoidable aversion is experienced. Thus, these two, attachment and aversion, bring under their control one who aspires to follow Jnana Yoga, and forcibly engage him in actions appropriate to them, in spite of his having established some sort of control over the senses.

Such an aspirant fails to get the experience of the self, and therefore becomes completely lost. So no one practising Jnana Yoga should come under the sway of attachment and aversion, which are ruinous. These two, attachment and aversion, are indeed his unconerable foes that deter him from the practice of Jnana Yoga.
3.34 See Comment under 3.35
3.34 Raga-dvesau, attraction and repulsion, in the following manner-attraction towards desirable things, and repulsion against undesirable things; (vyavasthitau, are ordained,) are sure to occur, arthe, with regard to objects such as sound etc.; indriyasya indriyasya, of all the organs, with regard to each of the organs.
As to that, the scope of personal effort and scriptural purpose are being stated as follows: One who is engaged in the subject-matter of the scriptures should, in the very beginning, not come under the influence of love and hatred. For, that which is the nature of a person impels him to his actions, verily under the influence eof love and hatred. And then follow the rejection of one's own duty and the undertaking of somody else's duty. On the other hand, when a person controls love and hatred with the help of their opposites [Ignorance, the cause of love and hatred, has discrimination as its opposite.], then he becomes mindful only of the scriptural teachings; he ceases to be led by his nature.
Therefore, na agacchet, one should not come; vasam, under the sway; tayoh, of these two, of love and hatred; hi because; tau, they; are asya, his, this person's pari-panthinau, adversaries, who, like robbers, put obstacles on his way to Liberation. This is the meaning.
In this world, one impelled by love and hatred misinterprets even the teaching of the scriptures, and thinks that somody else's duty, too, has to be undertaken just because it is a duty! That is wrong:
3.35 Better is one's own duty, though devoid of merit than the duty of another well discharged. Better is death in one's own duty; the duty of another is fraught with fear (is productive of danger).
3.35 It is better to do thine own duty, however lacking in merit, than to do that of another, even though efficiently. It is better to die doing one's own duty, for to do the duty of another is fraught with danger.
3.35. Better is one's own duty,  [though] it lacks in merit, than the well-performed duty of another; better is the ruin in one's own duty than the good fortune from another's duty.
3.35 Better is one's own duty, though ill-done, than the duty of another well-performed. Better is death in one's own duty; the duty of another is fraught with fear.
3.35 One's own duty [Customary or scripturally ordained observances of different castes and sects.-Tr.], though defective, is superior to another's duty well-performed. Death is better while engaged in one's own duty; another's duty is fraught with fear.
3.35 Therefore Karma Yoga is better than Jnana Yoga. For, it forms one's own duty, since it is natural to one and easy to perform, and though defective, is free from liability to interruption and fall. Jnana Yoga, on the other hand, though performed well for some time, constitutes the duty of another, as it is difficult to practise for one conjoined with Prakrti. It is therefore liable to interruption. For a person who lives practising Karma Yoga - which is his duty because he is alified for it - even death without success in one birth does not matter. For, in the next birth with the help of the experience already gained in the previous birth, it will be possible for him to perform Karma Yoga without any impediments. Jnana Yoga is fraught with fear because of the possibility of errors for anyone who is conjoined to Prakrti. It is another's duty, on account of it being not easily adoptable by him.
3.34-35 Indriyasya etc.,  Sreyan etc.  A person living the worldly life does entertain likes or dislikes towards every sense-object.  For, due to his total ignorance he imagines that actions are performed only by his Self.  Thus there is this difference between a man of knowledge and  a man of worldly life, eventhough they perform alike their [respective] worldly activities such as eating etc.
 
The established view of ours [in this regard] is this : For a person, who,  freed from attachment in every way,  Performs his own duty,  there is hardly any  bond of merit or demerit.  Indeed one's  own duty never disappears from one's heart and it is certainly rooted there deeply as a natural taste.  Not a single creature is born without that.  Hence it should not be given up.
3.35 Svadharmah, one's own duty; being practised even though vigunah, defective, deficient; is sreyan, superior to, more commendable than; para-dharmat, another's duty; though svanusthitat, well-performed, meritoriously performed. Even nidhanam, death; is sreyah, better; while engaged svadharme, in one's own duty, as compared with remaining alive while engaged in somody else's duty. Why? Paradharmah, another's duty; is bhayavahah, fraught with fear, since it invites dangers such as hell etc.
Although the root cause of evil was stated in, 'In the case of a person who dwells on objects' (2.62) and '৷৷৷৷.because they (attraction and repulsion) are his adversaries' (34), that was presented desultorily and vaguely. Wishing to know it briefly and definitely as, 'This is thus, to be sure', Arjuna, with the idea, 'When this indeed becomes known, I shall make effort for its eradication', said:
3.36 Arjuna said  But impelled by what does man commit sin, though against his wishes, O Varshneya (Krishna), constrained as it were, by force?
3.36 Arjuna asked: My Lord! Tell me, what is it that drives a man to sin, even against his will and as if by compulsion?
3.36. Arjuna said  Then, induced by what, does this person  [of the world]  commit sin-eventhough he does not desire it-as if instigated by a force,  overpowering [him] ?
3.36 Arjuna said  But, impelled by what, O Krsna, does one (practising Jnana Yoga), commit sin even against his own will, constrained as it were, by force?
3.36 Arjuna said  Now then, O scion of the Vrsni dynasty (Krsna), impelled by what does this man commit sin even against his wish, being constrained by force, as it were?
3.36 Arjuna said  Impelled by what does a man practising Jnana Yoga commit sin in the form of experiencing the objects of the senses, as if constrained by force, even against his own will not to experience the objects of the senses.
3.36 Atha etc.  The estion is this :  Eventhough a man knows a sin to be a sin,  why does he proceed on it ?  The idea in raising this estion is this :  If one's  own  duty cannot be (or should not be) given up, because it does  not vanish from one's  own heart, then how to account for the sinful acts of  these men [of the world] ?  This amounts to say :  What is one's own duty by which the creature is never deserted ?									
 Eventhough one's own duty rests in one's heart, the confusion (or evil) is created by the interruption (or covering) of an intruder, and  it is not created by the absence of that duty-with this purport in mind, an answer to the above estion-
3.36 Atha, now then; varsneya, O scion of the Vrsni dynasty; being prayuktah, impelled; kena, by what acting as the cause; as a servant is by a king, does ayam, this; purusah, man; carati, commit; papam, sin, a sinful act; api, even; anicchan, against his wish, though not himself willing; niyojitah, being constrained; balat, by force; iva, as it were-as if by a king, which illustration has already been given?
The Lord (Bhaga-van) said: 'You hear about that enemy, the source of all evil, of which you ask-.'
'Bhaga is said to consist of all kinds of majesty, virtue, fame, beauty, detachment as well as Liberation [Liberation stands for its cause, Illumination.], (V.P.6.5.74). That Vasudeva, in whom reside for ever, unimpeded and in their fullness, the six alities of majesty etc. and who has the knowledge of such subjects as creation etc., is called Bhaga-van. 'He is spoken of as Bhaga-van who is aware of creation and dissolution, gain and loss, [Gain and loss stand for future prosperity and adversity.] ignorance and Illumination of all beings' (ibid. 78).
3.37 The Blessed Lord said  It is desire, it is anger both of the ality of Rajas, all-devouring, all-sinful; know this as the foe here (in this world).
3.37 Lord Shri Krishna: It is desire, it is aversion, born of passion. Desire consumes and corrupts everything. It is man's greatest enemy.
3.37. The Bhagavat said  This desire,  this wrath,  born of the Rajas-Strand, is a swallower of festival [and] a mighty bestower of  sins.  Know this to be the enemy here.
3.37 The Lord said  It is desire, it is wrath, born of the Guna of Rajas; it is a great devourer, an impeller to sin. Know this to be the foe here.
3.37 The Blessed Lord said  This desire, this anger, born of the ality of rajas, is a great devourer, a great sinner. Know this to be the enemy here.
3.37 The Lord said  The highly ravenous desire is born of the Guna Rajas originating from old subtle impressions. It has for its objects sound and other sense contacts. It is a foe to him who is practising Jnana Yoga, as he is joined with Prakrti constituted of the Gunas which rise and subside periodically. It attracts him towards the objects of the senses. It is this desire alone which, when hampered, develops into anger towards those persons who are the cause of such hindrance. It is a powerful cause of sin. It incites the aspirant to do harm to others. Know this, which is born of the Guna called Rajas, as the natural enemy of Jnana Yogins.
3.37 Kama esah etc.  A total absence of difference among these two (desire and wrath)  is indicated by the word esah  'this'  twice uttered.  These desire and wrath are ever interrelated and remain in an inseparable mutual co-existence.   Hence [the Lord]  well describes them only  as identical.  This is  a swallower i.e.,  a devouer of the morsel  of festival i.e.,   the happiness.   The wrath alone is a bestower of sins as it is the cause of great sins.  This is man of intelligence  should view to be an enemy.
3.37 Esah, this; kamah, desire, is the enemy of the whole world, because of which the creatures incur all evil. This desire when obstructed in any way turns into anger. Therefore, krodhah, anger, is also identical with this (desire). It is rajoguna-samudbhavah, born of the ality of rajas; or, it is the origin of the ality of rajas. For, when desire comes into being, it instigates a person by arousing rajas. People who are engaged in service etc., which are effects of rajas, and who are stricken with sorrow are heard to lament, 'I have been led to act by desire indeed!' It is mahaasanah, a great devourer, whose food is enormous. And hence, indeed, it is maha-papma, a great sinner. For a being commits sin when goaded by desire. Therefore, viddhi, know; enam, this desire; to be vairinam, the enemy; iha, here in this world.
With the help of examples the Lord explains how it is an enemy:
3.38 As fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror by dust, and as an embryo by the amnion, so is this enveloped by that.
3.38 As fire is shrouded in smoke, a mirror by dust and a child by the womb, so is the universe enveloped in desire.
3.38. As the fire is concealed by smoke and a mirror by dirt, and as the embryo is concealed by membrance-cover,  so He is concealed by this (foe).
3.38 As a fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, and as an embryo is encased in the membrane, so is this (worldA) enveloped by it (desire).
3.38 As fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror by dirt, and as a foetus remains enclosed in the womb, so in this shrouded by that.
3.38 As a fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror by dust and as an embryo by the membrance, so are the embodied beings covered by this desire.

Sri Krsna teaches the mode of this envelopement:
3.38  Dhumena etc.  [The foe's tripple nature viz.]  being a mischivous appendage, himself creating mischieves, and being an object of disgust, is explained by the triad of these similes.  He :  the Self.
3.38 Yatha, as; vahnih, fire, which is naturally bright; avriyate, is enveloped; dhumena, by smoke, which is born concomitantly (with fire) and is naturally dark; or as adarsah, a mirror; is covered malena, by dirt; ca, and; garbhah, a foetus; is avrtah, enclosed; ulbena, in the womb by the amnion; tatha, so; is idam, this; avrtam, shrouded; tena, by that.
Again, what is that which is indicated by the word idam (this), and which is covered by desire? The answer is:
3.39 O Arjuna, wisdom is enveloped by this constant enemy of the wise in the form of desire, which is unappeasable as fire.
3.39 It is the wise man's constant enemy; it tarnishes the face of wisdom. It is as insatiable as a flame of fire.
3.39. O son of Kunti !  The knowledge of the wise is concealed by this eternal foe, which looks like a desired one,  and which is the fire insatiable.
3.39 The knowledge of the intelligent self is enveloped by this constant enemy, O Arjuna, which is of the nature of desire, and which is difficult to gratify and is insatiable.
3.39 O son of Kunti, Knowledge is covered by this constant enemy of the wise in the form of desire, which is an insatiable fire.
3.39 The knowledge, having the self for its subject, of this embodied person (the Jiva) whose nature is knowledge, is enveloped by this constant enemy in the shape of desire, which brings about attachment for sense-objects. This desire is difficult to satisfy, i.e., has for its object things unworthy of attainment and is insatiable, i.e., never attains satisfaction.

Now listen to what constitutes the instruments with which desire subdues the self. Sri Krsna goes on to expound this:
3.39 Avrtam etc.  Looks like a desired one :  For it acts when there is desire.  It is fire,  because it is like fire impossible to satiate.  For, it burns down both the visible and the invisible results  [of rightious actions].
3.39 Jnanam, Knowledge; is avrtam, covered; etena, by this; nityavairina, constant enemy; jnaninah, of the wise. For the wise person knows even earlier, 'I am being induced by this into evil.' And he always [Both at the time when desire arises in him, and also when he is forced to act by it.] feels distressed. Therefore, it is the constant enemy of the wise but not of a fool. For the fool looks upon desire as a friend so long as hankering lasts. When sorrow comes as a conseence, he realizes, 'I have been driven into sorrow because of longings', but certainly not earlier. Therefore it is the constant enemy of the wise alone.
In what form? Kama-rupena, in the form of desire-tha which has wish itself as its expression is kama-rupa; in that form-; (and) duspurena, which is an insatiable; analena, fire. That which is difficult to satisfy is duspurah; and (derivatively) that which never has enough (alam) is analam.
Again, having what as its abode does desire, in the form of a viel over Knowledge, become the enemy of all? Since when the abode of an enemy is known, it is possible to easily slay the enemy, therefore the Lord says:
3.4 Not by non-performance of actions does man reach actionlessness; nor by mere renunciation does he attain to perfection.
3.4 No man can attain freedom from activity by refraining from action; nor can he reach perfection by merely refusing to act.
3.4. A person attains actionlessness not [just] by non-commencement of actions;  and not just by renunciation,  he attains success (emancipation).
3.4 No man experiences freedom from activity (Naiskarmya) by abstaining from works; and no man ever attains success by mere renunciation of works.
3.4 A person does not attain freedom from action by abstaining from action; nor does he attain fulfilment merely through renunciation.
3.4 Not by non-performance of the acts prescribed by the scriptures, does a person attain freedom from Karma, i.e., Jnana Yoga; nor by ceasing to perform such actions as are prescribed in the scriptures and are already begun by him. For, success is achieved by actions done without attachment to the fruits and by way of worshipping the Supreme Person. Hence devoid of it (Karma-nistha), one does not achieve Jnana-nistha. By those persons who have not worshipped Govinda by acts done without attachment to fruits and whose beginningless and endless accumulation of evil has not been annulled thery, constant contemplation on the self is not possible. It can be done only if it is preceded by the attainment of a state in which the operation of the senses have been freed from disturbance.

This view is put forward by the Lord:
3.4 See Comment under 3.5
3.4 Purusah, a person; na does not; asnute, attain; naiskarmyam, freedom from action, the state of being free from action, steadfastness in the Yoga of Knowledge, i.e. the state of abiding in one's own Self which is free from action; anarambhat, by abstaining; karmanam, from actions-by the non-performance of actions such as sacrifices etc. which are or were performed in the present or past lives, which are the causes of the purification of the mind by way of attenuating the sins incurred, and which, by being the cause of that (purification), become the source of steadfastness in Knowledge through the generation of Knowledge, as stated in the Smrti (text), 'Knowledge arises in a person from the attenuation of sinful acts' [the whole verse is:
Jnanam utpadyate pumsamksayatpapasya karmanah;
Yathadarsatalaprakhye pasyatyatmanamatmani.
'Knowledge arises৷৷.acts. One sees the Self in oneself as does one (see oneself) in a cleaned surface of a mirror'.-Tr.] (Mbh. Sa. 204.8). This is the import.
From the statement that one does not attain freedom from action by abstaining from actions, it may be concluded that one attains freedom from action by following the opposite course of performing actions. What, again, is the reason that one does not attain freedom from action by abstaining from actions? The answer is: Because performing actions is itself a means to freedom from action. Indeed, there can be no attainment of an end without (its) means. And Karma-yoga is the means to the Yoga of Knowledge characterized by freedom from action, because it has been so established in the Upanisads and here as well. As for the Upanisads, it has been shown in the texts, 'The Brahmanas seek to know It through the study of the Vedas, sacrifices, (charity, and austerity consisting in a dispassionate enjoyment of sense-objects)' (Br. 4.4.22), etc. whch deal with the means of realizing the goal of Knowledge under discussion, viz the Realm of the Self, that the Yoga of Karma is a means to the Yoga of Knowledge . And even here (in the Gita), the Lord will established that, 'But, O mighty-armed one, renunciation is hard to attain without (Karma-)yoga' (5.6); 'By giving up attachment, the yogis undertake work৷৷.for the purification of themselves' (5.11); 'Sacrifice, charity and austerity are verily the purifiers of the wise' (18.5), etc.
Objection: Is it not that in such texts as-'Extending to all creatures immunity from fear' (Na. Par. 5.43), (one should take recourse to freedom from action)-, it is shown that attainment of freedom from action follows even from the renunciation of obligatory duties? And in the world, too, it is a better known fact that freedom from action follows abstention from actions. Hence also arises the estion, 'Why should one who desires freedom from action undertake action?'
Reply: Therefore the Lord said: Na ca, nor; samadhi-gacchati, does he attain; siddhim, fulfilment steadfastness in the Yoga of Knowledge, characterized by freedom from action; sannyasanat eva, merely through renunciation-even from the mere renunciation of actions which is devoid of Knowledge.
What, again, is the reason that by the mere giving up of actions which is not accompanied with Knowledge, a person does not attain fulfulment in the form of freedom from actions? To this ery seeking to know the cause, the Lord says:
3.40 The senses, the mind and the intellect are said to be its seat; through these it deludes the embodied by veiling his wisdom.
3.40 It works through the senses, the mind and the reason; and with their help destroys wisdom and confounds the soul.
3.40. It basis is said to be the sense-organs, the mind and the intellect.  With these it deludes the embodied by concealing knowledge.
3.40 The senses, the mind and the intellect are said to be its instruments. By these it overpowers the embodied self after enveloping Its knowledge.
3.40 The organs, mind, and the intellect are said to be its abode. This one diversely deludes the embodied being by veiling Knowledge with the help of these.
3.40 The senses, the mind and the intellect are the instruments of desire in so far as it overpowers the self through them. By means of these, viz., the senses, the mind and the intellect, which have been reduced to the position of servants through attachment to sense objects, desire deludes the embodied soul caught up in Prakrti by covering up Its knowledge. Here 'deluding' means making the self a victim of manifold illusions, by turning It away from the knowledge of Its true nature, and making It indulge in sensuous experiences.
3.40 Indriyani etc.  In the beginning, it stands on the sense organs at work.  For example, when an enemy is sighted with eyes, he generates wrath about himself at the very place of the perceiver's  sense-organ,  then in the mind i.e., fancy,  then in the intellect, i.e., resolve; and producing delusion in this way, it destroys knowledge.									
 [The Lord]  speaks of the means for avoiding this foe as :
3.40 Indriyani, the organs; manah, mind; and buddhih, the intellect; ucyate, are said to be; asya, its, desire's; adhisthanam, abode. Esah, this one, desire; vimohayati, diversely deludes; dehinam, the embodied being; avrtya, by veiling; jnanam, Knowledg; etaih, with the help of these, with the organs etc. which are its abodes. [The activities of the organs etc. are the media for the expression of desire. Desire covers the Knoweldge of the Self by stimulating these.]
3.41 Therefore, O best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), controlling the senses first, do thou kill this sinful thing, the destroyer of knowledge and realisation.
3.41 Therefore, O Arjuna, first control thy senses and then slay desire, for it is full of sin, and is the destroyer of knowledge and of wisdom.
3.41. Therefore,  O best among the Bharatas, by controlling completely the sense-organs in the beginning [itself], you must avoid this sinful one, destroying the knowledge-action.
3.41 Therefore, O Arjuna, controlling the senses in the very beginning, slay this sinful thing that destroys both knowledge and discrimination.
3.41 Therefore, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, after first controlling the organs, renounce this one [A variant reading is, 'prajahi hi-enam, completely renounce this one'.-Tr.] which is sinful and a destroyer of learning and wisdom.
3.41 For whatever reason a person engaged in Jnana Yoga, which is of the nature of abandoning the activities of all the senses, should control this enemy in the shape of desire which turns him away from the self through creating infatuation for objects of the senses - for the same reason, you, who are yoked to the activities of the senses by reason of being in conjunction with the Prakrti, should, in the beginning itself, i.e., at the very beginning of the practice of the means for release, control the senses by the practice of Karma Yoga, which provides for the regulation of the working of the senses. And then you must destroy, i.e., slay this sinful enemy, which is in the shape of desire and which destroys knowledge and discrimination, i.e., knowledge relating to the nature of the self and of the discriminative power, which is the means to gain this knowledge.

Sri Krsna speaks of that which is most important among the adversaries:
3.41 Or the passage jnana-vijnana-nasana may be an adverb  [modifying the verb 'must avoid']  meaning  'by destroying  it i.e.,  by keeping it  off by means of knowledge  (thought)  i.e.,  by means of the mind and by means of superior  knowledge  (superior thought)  i.e.,  by means of the intellect.'  The intention is this :  One must not allow,  in the fancy,  [the wrath]  risen in the sense-organs, and must not make any resolve about  [the foe], fancied.			
  The logic in this regard (in the above means) [ the Lords ] explains in a couple of verses:
3.41 Since this is so, therefore, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, adau niyamya, after first controlling; indriyani, the organs; prajahihi, renounce; enam, this one, the enemy under consideration; which is papmanam, sinful-which is desire that is accustomed to sinning; and jnana-vijnana-nasanam, a destroyer of learning and wisdom, jnana, learning, means knowledge about the Self etc. from the scripures and a teacher. Vijnana, wisdom, means the full experience of that.
Renounce, i.e. discard, from yourself the destroyer of those two-learning and wisdom, which are the means to the achievement Liberation.
It has been said, 'After first controlling the organs, renounce desire the enemy'. As to that, by taking the support of what should one give up desire? This is being answered:
3.42 They say that the senses are superior (to the body); superior to the senses is the mind; superior to the mind is the intellect; one who is superior even to the intellect is He (the Self).
3.42 It is said that the senses are powerful. But beyond the senses is the mind, beyond the mind is the intellect, and beyond and greater than intellect is He.
3.42. Different are the sense-organs [from their objects], they say; from the sense-organs different is the mind; from the mind too the intellect is different; what is different from the intellect is That (Self).
3.42 The senses are high, they say:  the mind is higher than the senses; the intellect is higher than the mind; but what is greater than intellect is that (desire).
3.42 They say that the organs are superior (to the gross body); the mind is superior to the organs; but the intellect is superior to the mind. However, the one who is superior to the intellect is He.
3.42 The senses are called the important obstacles of knowledge, because when the senses keep operating on their objects, the knowledge of the self cannot arise. 'The mind is higher than the senses':  even if the senses are withdrawn, if the Manas (mind) ruminates over sense objects, knowledge of the self cannot be had. 'The intellect (Buddhi) is greater than the mind', i.e., even if the mind is indifferent to sense objects, a perverted decision by the intellect can obstruct the dawn of the knowledge of the self. But even if all of them upto the intellect are ietened from their activity, still when desire, identified with will, originating from Rajas, is operating, it by itself obstructs the knowledge of the self by inducing the senses etc., to operate in their fields. Thus it is said here:  'But what is greater than intellect is that.' What is greater than the intellect - is desire. Such is the sense of the last sentence here.
3.42 See Comment under 3.43
3.42  The learned ones ahuh, say; that indriyani, the five [Five sense-organs: of vision, hearning, taste, smell and touch; five motor-organs: hands, feet, speech, and for excretion and generation-these latter five are also understood in the present context.] organs-ear etc., are parani, superior, to the external, gross and limited body, from the point of view of subtlety, inner position, pervasiveness, etc. So also, manah, the mind, having the nature of thinking and doubting; [Sankalpa: will, volition, intention, thought, reflection, imangination, etc. vikalpa:doubt, uncertainly, indecision, suspicion, error, etc.-V.S.A.] is param, superior; indriyhyah, to the organs. Similarly, buddhih, the intellect, having the nature of determination; is para, superior; manasah, to the mind. And yah, the one who is innermost as compared with all the objects of perception ending with the intellect, and with regard to which Dweller in the body it has been said that desire, in association with its 'abodes' counting from the organs, deludes It by shrouding Knowledge; sah, that one; is tu, however; paratah, superior; buddheh, to the intellect- He, the supreme Self, is the witness of the intellect. [The portion, 'with regard to which Dweller৷৷.the supreme Self,' is translated from Ast. Which has the same reading here as the A.A. The G1. Pr. Makes the "abode''
counting from the organs' an adjective of 'the Dweller in the body', and omits the portion, 'is tu, however৷৷.buddheh, to the intellect'.-Tr.]
3.43 Thus knowing Him Who is superior to the intellect and restraining the self by the Self, slay thou, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the enemy in the form of desire, hard to coner.
3.43 Thus, O Mighty-in-Arms, knowing Him to be beyond the intellect and, by His help, subduing thy personal egotism, kill thine enemy, Desire, extremely difficult though it be."
3.43. Thus being conscious :  'That is different from the intellect';  and steadying the self with the self; kill the foe that is of the form of desire and that is hard to approach.
3.43 Thus, knowing that which is higher than the intellect and fixing the mind with the help of the intellect in Karma Yoga, O Arjuna, slay this enemy which wears the form of desire, and which is difficult to overcome.
3.43 [The Ast, introdcues this verse with, 'Tatah kim, what follows from that?'-Tr.] Understanding the Self thus [Understanding৷৷.thus:that desires can be conered through the knowledge of the Self.] as superior to the intellect, and completely establishing (the Self) is spiritual absorption with the (help of) the mind, O mighty-armed one, vanish the enemy in the form of desire, which is difficult to subdue.
3.43 Thus, understanding desire, which is higher than even the intellect, to be the fore antagonistic to Jnana Yoga, and establishing the mind by means of the intellect in Karma Yoga, slay, i.e., destroy this foe, in the shape of desire which is difficult to overcome.
3.42-43 Indriyani etc. Evam  etc. 'Because the sense-organs are different from the sense-objects that indicate the foe [in estion];  from them the mind is different; from that too different is the intellect;  what is instrinsically different from the intellect also is the Self;  so due to wrath, risen at the sense-organs, how can there be a disturbance in the mind, in the intellect or in the Self ?'  Let one contemplate in this manner.  This is what is meant here.
 
This is intention of the experts of the Rahasya [literature] :  The Supreme I-consciousness viz.,  the awareness  'All I am',  which remains beyond the intellect, and the essence of which allows no difference-that is indeed the highest identity.  Therefore no  furstration (or cut)  can be for That which is complete all around; hence wrath etc., do not rise [in It].  Therefore, taking hold of the Supreme Energy which in essence is Consciousness,  you must slay the foe, the wrath which is ignorance in essence.
3.43 Buddhva, understanding; atmanam, the Self; evam, thus; as param, superior; buddheh, to the intellect; and samstabhya, completely establishing; atmana, with the mind, i.e. establishing (the Self) fully in spiritual absorption with the help of your own purified mind; O mighty-armed one, jahi, vanish; this satrum, enemy; kama-rupam, in the form of desire; which is durasadam, difficult to subdue-which can be got hold of with great difficulty, it being possessed of many inscrutable characteristics.
3.5 Verily none can ever remain for even a moment without performing action; for everyone is made to act helplessly indeed by the alities born of Nature.
3.5 He cannot even for a moment remain really inactive, for the Qualities of Nature will compel him to act whether he will or no.
3.5. For, no one can ever remain, even for a moment, as a non-performer of action; because everyone,  being not master of himself,  is forced to perform action by the Strands born of the Prakrti (Material cause)
3.5 No man can, even for a moment, rest without doing work; for everyone is caused to act, in spite of himself, by the Gunas born of Nature.
3.5  Because, no one ever remains even for a moment without doing work. For all are made to work under compulsion by the gunas born of Nature.
3.5 In this world, no man can rest without doing work; for every person, even though he may have determined, 'I will not do anything,' is caused to act, i.e., is compelled to act according to the Gunas born of Prakrti. The Gunas are Sattva, Rajas and Tamas which increase in accordance with his old Karma. Conseently, Jnana Yoga can be attained only by means of a purified inner organ after annulling the old accumulation of sins by means of Karma Yoga of the aforesaid characteristics and bringing Sattva and other Gunas under control.

Otherwise, one who engages oneself in Jnana Yoga becomes a hypocrite:
3.4-5 Na karmanam etc Na hi etc.  Knowledge, deserted by action, does not exist;  and the action, combined with dexterity does not exist,  [if it is] deserted by knowledge. Therefore knowledge and action constitute one and the same thing.  Hence it has been delclared :
 
    'Knowledge is not deserted by action and action is
         not deserted by knowledge.  [Hence]  a teacher who
         is well accomplished in knowledge and action, is
         the cutter of the fetters of the fettered'. 
 
Therefore the action that is included within the knowledge cannot be avoided.  For, the body, the organ of speech and the mind are, by nature, in a perpetual motion; and hence an individual, being simply under the control of other than himself, necessarily performs one action or the other.  For, the body, the speech-organ and the mind are of the nature of throbing.
3.5 Hi, because; na kascit, no one; jatu, ever; tisthati, remains; api, even; for so much time as a ksanam, moment; akarma-krt, without doing work. Why? Hi, for; sarvah, all creatures; karyate karma, are made to work; verily avasah, under compulsion; gunaih, by the gunas-sattva (goodness); rajas (activity), and tamas (mental darkness); prakrti-jaih, born of Nature. The word 'unenlightened' has to be added to the sentence, since the men of realzation have been spoken of separately in, 'who is not distracted by the three gunas (alities)' (14.23). For Karma-yoga is meant only for the unenlightened, nor for the men of Knowledge. Karma-yoga, on the other hand, is not pertinent for the men of Knowledge who, because of their not moving away from their own Self, are not shaken by the gunas. This has been explained similarly in, 'he who has known this One as indestructible' (2.21).
But, if one who is not a knower of the self does not perform prescribed action, then this is certainly bad. Hence the Lord says:
3.6 He who, restraining the organs of action, sits thinking of the sense-objects in mind, he of deluded understanding is called a hypocrite.
3.6 He who remains motionless, refusing to act, but all the while brooding over sensuous object, that deluded soul is simply a hypocrite.
3.6. Controlling organs of actions,  whosoever sits with his mind,  pondering over the sense objects-that person is a man of deluded soul and [he] is called a man of deluded action.
3.6 He who, controlling the organs of action, lets his mind dwell on the objects of senses, is a deluded person and a hypocrite.
3.6  One, who after withdrawing the organs of action, sits mentally recollecting the objects of the senses, that one, of deluded mind, is called a hypocrite.
3.6 He whose inner and outer organs of senses are not conered because of his sins not being annulled but is none the less struggling for winning knowledge of the self, whose mind is forced to turn away from the self by reason of it being attached to sense objects, and who conseently lets his minds dwell on them - he is called a hypocrite, because his actions are at variance with his professions. The meaning is that by practising the knowledge of the self in this way, he becomes perverted and lost.
3.6 Karmendriyani etc.  If he does not act with his organs of action, then he necessarily acts with his mind.  At the same time he is the man of deluded action;  For, the mental actions can never be avoided totally.
3.6 Yah, one who; samyamya, after withdrawing; karma-indriyani, the organs of action-hands etc.; aste, sits; manasa, mentally; smaran, recollecting, thinking; indriya-arthan, the objects of the senses; sah, that one; vimudha-atma, of deluded mind; ucyate, is called; mithya-acarah, a hypocrite, a sinful person.
3.7 But whosoever, controlling the senses by the mind, O Arjuna, engages himself in Karma Yoga with the organs of action, without attachment, he excels.
3.7 But, O Arjuna! All honour to him whose mind controls his senses, for he is thereby beginning to practise Karma-Yoga, the Path of Right Action, keeping himself always unattached.
3.7. But, controlling sense-organs by mind, whosoever undertakes the Yoga of action with the action-senses he,  the detached one, is superior  [to others], O Arjuna !
3.7 But he who, subduing his senses by the mind, O Arjuna, begins to practise Karma Yoga through the organs of action and who is free from attachment - he excels.
3.7  But, O Arjuna, one who engages in Karma-yoga with the organs of action, controlling the organs with the mind and becoming unattached-that one excels.
3.7 Conseently, he who, with aspiration to have the vision of the self, directs his senses to action according to the scriptures, such action being of the same class as those which he practised earlier, and who then begins to practise Karma Yoga, after renouncing attachment, with the senses which are naturally inclined to action - he, by reason of there being no chance of errors, excels a man following Jnana Yoga, because there is no fear of a fall in his case.
3.7 Yas tu etc.  When actions are being performed  [by him], there is no loss of his  knowledge.  For, when the mind does not function, he does his work like a machine-man.									
 Therefore -
3.7 Tu, but, on the other hand, O Arjuna; yah, one who is unenlightened and who is eligible for action; arabhate, engages in;-what does he engage in? the Lord says in answer-karma yogam, Karma-yoga; karma-indriyaih, with the organs of action, with speech, hands, etc.; niyamya, controlling; indriyani, the sense-organs; manasa, with the mind; and becoming asaktah unattached; [Here Ast; adds 'phalabhisandhi-varjitah, free from hankering for results'.-Tr.] sah, that one; visisyate, excels the other one, the hypocrite.
This being so, therefore,
3.8 Do thou perform (thy) bounden duty, for action is superior to inaction and even the maintenance of the body would not be possible for thee by inaction.
3.8 Do thy duty as prescribed, for action for duty's sake is superior to inaction. Even the maintenance of the body would be impossible if man remained inactive.
3.8. You must perform your action which has been enjoined.  For, action is superior to inaction; and even the maintenance of your body could not be properly accomplished through inaction.
3.8 You must perform your obligatory action; for action is superior to non-action (Jnana Yoga). For a person following non-action not even the sustentation of the body is possible.
3.8  You perform the obligatory duties, for action is superior to inaction. And, through inaction, even the maintenance of your body will not be possible.
3.8 'Obligatory' (Niyatam) means 'concomitant' (Vyaptam); for action is concomitant with that which is conjoined with Prakrti or the body. The contact with Prakrti has arisen from beginingless subtle impressions (Vasanas). You must perform work, because the performance of action is easy and may not cause accidents by reason of its being obligatory. Action is superior to non-action, i.e., even to the devotee of Jnana. Because of the instruction at the beginning (of this context), 'No man experiences freedom from activity' (3.4), devotion to Jnana alone is indicated by the word, 'Non-action' (Akarma). Even in the case of one alified for devotion to Jnana, devotion to Karma indeed is better because Jnana-nistha is difficult to perform and liable to accidents, as it has not been practised previoulsy and as it does not come to one naturally. Subseently it will be described how, one with the knowledge of the true nature of the self can carry on actions along with that knowledge. Conseently, we should take the meaning here to be that, because knowledge of the self too is included in Karma Yoga, this kind of Yoga is superior.

This statement on the superiority of activity (Karma Yoga) over Jnana Yoga is valid even when there is competency for one to adopt Jnana Yoga. For, if you abandon all activities to alify yourself for Jnana Yoga, then, for you, who is thus inactive while following Jnana Yoga, even the nourishment of the body, which is necessary even for Jnana-nistha, will not be achieved. The body has to be necessarily sustained until the means are executed to the full. Performing 'great sacrifices' with the help of honestly earned wealth, the body should be sustained by consuming the remainders left after such sacrifices. This is made clear from scriptural texts like, 'When the food is pure, the Sattva (mind or inner organ) becomes pure; when the Sattva is pure, then the remembrance (meditation) will be steady' (Cha. U., 7.26.2). Sri Krsna himself will declare:  'The sinful ones who cook food for their own sake eat sin (3.13).

Conseently,even the sustenance of the body will not be possible in the case of one who practises Jnana-nistha, and does not act. In other ways also Karma Yoga is superior to Jnana Yoga even in respect of one who is alified for Jnana-nistha; for, obligatory and occasional rites like the 'great sacrifices' must be carried out by one who follows Jnana Yoga too, as he has to sustain the body until he attains perfection. Besides, the understanding of the true nature of the self is incorporated in Karma Yoga, as it involves the contemplation of the self as being a non-agent. It is also in line with the nature of life (Prakrti). Karma Yoga, is for these reasons easier and it is free from danger of downfall. Therefore, you must perform Karma Yoga only. This is the purport of the verse.

If it is contended that any action such as earning money implies 'I-ness', 'My-ness' etc., and will therefore be disturbing to the senses, and that such a person devoted often to works will be in bondage through subtle impressions of his acts, Sri Krsna says:
3.8 Niyatam etc.  you must perform action which has been enjoined i.e., prescribed in the scriptures. For, even the just subsistence of body depends on action.	
 Because -
3.8 Tvam, you, O Arjuna; kuru, perform; niyatam, the obligatory; karma, duties, those daily obligatory duties (nitya-karmas) or which one is competent (according to the scriptures), and which are not heard of [although no result of daily obligatory duties is mentioned in the scriptures, still Sankaracarya holds that it is either heaven or purification of the heart, because something done must have its conseence.-Tr.] as productive of any result; hi, for, from the point of view of result; karma, action; is jyayah, superior; akarmanah, to inaction, to non-performance (of duties). Why? Ca, and; akarmanah, through inaction; api, even; te sarira-yatra, the maintenance of your body; na prasiddhyet, will not be possible. Therefore, the distinction between action and in action is abvious in this world.
'And as regards your ideea that action should not be udnertaken because it leads to bondage-that too is wrong.' How?
3.9 The world is bound by actions other than those performed for the sake of sacrifice; do thou, therefore, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), perform action for that sake (for sacrifice alone), free from attachment.
3.9 In this world people are fettered by action, unless it is performed as a sacrifice. Therefore, O Arjuna, let thy acts be done without attachment, as sacrifice only.
3.9. The world is fettered by action  which is other than the Yajnartha action;  hence, O son of Kunti, being freed from attachment, you most properly perform Yajnartha action.
3.9 This world is held in the bondage of work only when work is not performed as sacrifice. O Arjuna, you must perform work to this end, free from attachment.
3.9  This man becomes bound by actions other than that action meant for God. Without being attached, O son of Kunti, you perform actions for Him.
3.9 The world is imprisoned by the bond of work only when work is done for personal ends, but not when work is performed or money acired for the purpose of sacrifice etc. prescribed in the scriptures. So, for the purpose of sacrifice, you must perform acts like the acisition of money. In doing so, overcome attachments generated by the pursuit of personal ambitions, and then do your work in the spirit of Yajna. When a person free from attachment does the work for the sake of sacrifices etc., the Supreme Person, propitiated by sacrifices etc., grants him the calm vision of the self after destroying the subtle impressions of his Karmas, which have continued from time without beginning.

Sri Krsna stresses the need for sustenance of the body solely by the remnants of sacrifices in respect of those who are devoted to all ends of human life. He decries the sin of those who nourish the body by things other than the remnants of sacrifices:
3.9 Yajnarthat etc.   Binding are the actions which are different from the one that is Yajnartha, i.e.,  the one that is to be performed necessarily.  The action, that is  to be performed necessarily, does not yield any fruit, if it is performed with no attachment for the fruit.
3.9 Ayam, this; lokah, man, the one who is eligible for action; karma-bandhanah, becomes bound by actions- the person who has karma as his bondage (bandhana) is karma-bandhanah-; anyatra, other than; that karmanah, action; yajnarthat, meant for Got not by that meant for God. According to the Vedic text, 'Sacrifice is verily Visnu' (Tai. Sam. 1.7.4), yajnah means God; whatever is done for Him is yajnartham.
Therefore, mukta-sangah, without being attached, being free from attachment to the results of actions; O son of Kunti, samacara, you perform; karma, actions; tadartham, for Him, for God.
An eligible person should engage in work for the following reason also:
4.1 The Blessed Lord said  I taught this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan; he told it to Manu; Manu proclaimed it to Ikshvaku.
4.1 "Lord Shri Krishna said: This imperishable philosophy I taught to Viwaswana, the founder of the Sun dynasty, Viwaswana gave it to Manu the lawgiver, and Manu to King Ikshwaku!
4.1. The Bhagavat said  This changeless Yoga  I had properly taught thus to Vivasvat;  Vivasvat correctly told it ot Manu;  and Manu declared to Iksvaku.
4.1 The Lord said  I taught this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan; Vivasvan taught it to Manu; Manu declared it to Iksvaku.
4.1 The Blessed Lord said  I imparted this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan, Vivasvan taught this to Manu, and Manu transmitted this to Iksavaku.
4.1 - 4.2 The Lord said  This Karma Yoga declared to you should not be considered as having been taught now merely, for creating encouragement in you for war. I Myself had taught this Yoga to Vivasvan at the commencement of Manu's age as a means for all beings to attain release, which is man's supreme end. Vivasvan taught it to Manu, and Manu to Iksvaku. The royal sages of old knew this Yoga transmitted by tradition. Because of long lapse of time and because of the dullness of the intellect of those who heard it, it has been almost lost.
4.1 See Comment under 4.3
4.1 In the beginning of creation, with a veiw to infusing vigour into the Ksatriyas who are the protectors of the world, aham, I; proktavan, imparted; imam, this; avyayam, imperishable; yogam, Yoga, presented in the (preceding) two chapters; vivasvate, to Vivasvan, the Sun. Being endowed with this power of Yoga, they would be able to protect the Brahmana caste. The protection of the world becomes ensured when the Brahmanas and the Ksatriyas are protected.
It (this Yoga) is avyayam, imperishable, because its result is undecaying. For, the result-called Liberation-of this (Yoga), which is characterized by steadfastness in perfect Illumination, does not decay. And he, Vivasvan, praha, taught (this); manave, to Manu. Manu abravit, transmitted (this); iksvakave, to Iksvaku, his own son who was the first king. [First king of the Iksvaku dynasty, otherwise known as the Solar dynasty.]
4.10 Freed from attachment, fear and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, purified by the fire of knowledge, many have attained to My Being.
4.10 Many have merged their existences in Mine, being freed from desire, fear and anger, filled always with Me and purified by the illuminating flame of self-abnegation.
4.10. Many persons, who are free from passion, fear and anger; are full of Me; take refuge in Me;  and have become pure by the austerity of  wisdom-they have come to My being.
4.10 Freed from desire, fear and wrath, absorbed in Me, depending upon Me, purified by the austerity of knowledge, many have attained My state.
4.10 Many who were devoid of attachment, fear and anger, who were absorbed in Me, who had taken refuge in Me, and were purified by the austerity of Knowledge, have attained My state.
4.10 Purified by the austerity called knowledge of the truth of My life and deeds, many have become transformed in this manner. The Sruti says to the same effect:  'The wise know well the manner in which He is born' (Tai. A., 3.13.1). 'Dhiras' means the foremost among the wise. The meaning is the wise know the manner of His birth thus.

It is not that I protect only those who resort to Me in incarnations in the shapes of gods, men etc.
4.10 Vita-etc.  Therefore many persons, who realise in this manner are free anger etc., because they have [all] their desires completely  fulfilled, due to their being  full of Me;  and who perform actions which are to be performed and which do not yield any fruit  [for them] - they  have attained My own nature.		
 For-
4.10 Bahavah, many; vita-raga-bhaya-krodhah, who were devoid of attachment, fear and anger; manmayah, who were absorbed in Me, who were knowers of Brahman, who were seers of (their) identity with God; mam upasrithah, who had taken refuge only in Me, the supreme God, i.e. who were steadfast in Knowledge alone; and were putah, purified, who had become supremely sanctified; jnana-tapasa, by the austerity of Knowledge-Knowledge itself, about the supreme Reality, being the austerity; becoming sanctified by that austerity of Knowledge-; agatah, have attained; madbhavam, My state, Goodhood, Liberation.
The particular mention of 'the austerity of Knowledge' is to indicate that steadfastness in Knowledge does not depend on any other austerity.
'In that case, You have love and aversion, because of which You grant the state of identity with Yourself only to a few but not to others?'
The answer is:
4.11 In whatever way men approach Me even so do I reward them; My path do men tread in all ways, O Arjuna.
4.11 Howsoever men try to worship Me, so do I welcome them. By whatever path they travel, it leads to Me at last.
4.11. The way in which men resort to Me, in the same way I favour them.  O son of  Prtha,  all sorts of men follow the path of  Mine.
4.11 Whoever resortt to Me in any manner, in the same manner do I favour them; men experience Me alone in different ways, O Arjuna.
4.11 According to the manner in which they approach Me, I favour them in that very manner. O son of Partha, human beings follow My path in every way.
4.11 Whoever desirous of resorting to Me, in whatever manner they think of Me according to their inclinations and take refuge in Me, i.e., resort to Me - I favour them in the same manner as desired by them; I reveal Myself to them. Why say much here! All men who are intent on following Me do experience, with their own eyes and other organs of sense in all ways, i.e., in every way wished by them, My form (including images), however inaccessible it might be to speech and thought of the Yogins.

Now, after completing the incidental topic (with regard to divine incarnations), in order to teach the mode in which Karma Yoga itself acires the form of Jnana, He begins to speak of the difficulty in finding persons who are alified for Karma Yoga of this kind.
4.11 See Comment under 4.12
4.11 Yatha, according to the manner in which, the purpose for which, seeking, whatever fruit; prapadyante, they approach; mam, Me; aham, I; bhajami, favour; tan, them; tatha eva, in that very manner, by granting that fruit. This is the idea. For they are not seekers of Liberation. It is certainly impossible for the same person to be a seeker of Liberation and, at the same time, a seeker of rewards (of actions).
Therefore, by granting fruits to those who hanker after fruits; by granting Knowledge to those who follow what has been stated (in the scriptures) and are seekers of Liberation, but do not hanker after rewards; and by granting Liberation to those who are men of wisdom and are monks aspiring for Liberation; and so also by removing the miseries of those who suffer- in these ways I favour them just according to the manner, in which they approach Me. This is the meaning. On the other hand, I do not favour anybody out of love or aversion, or out of delusion.
Under all circumstances, O son of Prtha, manusyah, human beings; anuvartante, follow; sarvasah, in every way; mama, My; vartma, path, [The paths characterized by Knowledge and by action (rites and duties).] the path of God who am omnipresent. By 'human beings' are meant those people who become engaged in their respective duties to which they are alified according to the results they seek.
'If Your wish to be favourable is the same towards all creatures on account of the absence of the defects of love and aversion in You who are God, and You are there with Your capacity to grant all rewards, why then do not all, becoming desirous of Liberation, take refuge in You alone with the very knowledge that Vasudeva is everything?'
As to that, hear the reason for this:
4.12 Those who long for success in action in this world sacrifice to the gods; because success is ickly attained by men through action.
4.12 Those who look for success, worship the Powers; and in this world their actions bear immediate fruit.
4.12. Those, who are desirous of success of their actions,  perform sacrifices intending the deities.  For, the success born of  [ritualistic] actions is ick in the world of men.
4.12 Those who desire the fruits of their ritualistic acts, sacrifice to the gods here; for, success born of such acts ickly accrues in the world of men.
4.12 Longing for the fruition of actions (of their rites and duties), they worship the gods here. For, in the human world, success from action comes ickly.
4.12 All men, desirous of the fruits of their actions, 'sacrifice', i.e., worship or propitiate Indra and other divinities only. But nobody worships Me abandoning attachment to fruits - Me, who am the Self of Indra and other divinities and the real enjoyer of all sacrifices. Why is this so?  Because in this world of men, fruits in the form of sons, cattle, food etc., follow soon from their performance of such sacrificial rites. The phrase, 'the world of men' implies heaven etc., also. Because the unending accumulation of evil heaped up from beginningless time has not been exhausted, all those worldly people lack discernment. Therefore they want rapid results and perform those rituals which consist of the worship of Indra and other divinities for the sake of sons, cattle, food etc., and for the sake of heaven etc. But none with his mind anguished by Samsara and aspiring for final release, practises Karma Yoga of the kind described above. Real Karma Yoga is My worship.

Sri Krsna now speaks of the cause which annuls the evil obstructing the starting of Karma Yoga.
4.11-12 Ye yatha etc. and  Kanksantah etc.  Different  persons with differents forms in their mind take refuge  in Me.  Assuming the same [respective] forms  for them I favour the.  Only in this manner, those who are full of  Me and those who are not so-all just follow my Path.  For [even the performance of sacrifices]  Jyotistoma and so on, is not a different  path;  that is also My own will of that nature.  Indeed it is going to be declared [by the Lord]  as  'the four-fold caste-structure has been created by Me'.
 
Some one  says :  The  Present  Tense (anuvarttante)  is in the sense of Potential.  Just as in the sentence  'They take hold of the group of sixteen in the Atiratra  [sacrifce]',  the expression  'They take hold of' means  'They should  take hold of'  in the same way in the present sentence too 'they follow',  means  'they should follow'.
 
The success  [of the action] viz.,  the enjoyment and emancipation is  [achieved] here alone in this word of men and not anywhere else.
4.12 Kanksantah, longing for, praying for; siddim, fruition, fructification of the results; karmanam, of actions; yajante, they worship; iha, here, in this world; devatah, the gods, Indra, Fire and others- which accords with the Upanisadic text, 'While he who worships another god thinking, "He is one, and I am another," does not know. He is like an animal to the gods' (Br. 1.4.10). [This text points out that the reason for adoring other deties is the ignorance of the Self, which gives rise to the ideas of difference between the worshipped and the worshipper. As animals are beneficial to human beings, so also is the sacrificer to the gods, because through oblations he works for their pleasure!] Hi, for, in the case of those, indeed, who sacrifice to other gods and long for results; (siddhih, success; karmaja, from action;) bhavati, comes; ksiparm, ickly; manuse-loke, in the human world, because the authority of the scriptures extends only over the human world.
By the specific statement, 'For, in the human world, success comes ickly,' the Lord shows that results of actions can accrue even in the other worlds. The difference lies in this that, in the human world eligibility for [Ast. and A.A. omit 'adhikara, elegibility for', and read karmani.-Tr.] actions is according to castes, stages of life, etc. The fruition of the results of those actions of persons who are eligible according to castes, stages of life, etc. comes ickly.
What is the reason for the rule that the competence for rites and duties according to castes, stages of life, etc. obtains only in the human world, but not in the other worlds?
Or:-It has been said, 'Human beings, having such divisions as castes, stages of life, etc., follow My path in every way.' For what reason, again, do they as a rule follow Your path alone, but not of others? 
 
This is being answered:
4.13 The fourfold caste has been created by Me according to the differentiation of Guna and Karma; though I am the author thereof know Me as non-doer and immutable.
4.13 The four divisions of society (the wise, the soldier, the merchant, the labourer) were created by Me, according to the natural distribution of Qualities and instincts. I am the author of them, though I Myself do no action, and am changeless.
4.13. The four-fold caste-structure has been created by Me,  according to the division of [their respective]  alities and actions.  Though I am the creator of this,  know Me as a changeless non-creator.
4.13 The system of four stations was created by Me according to distinction of Gunas and Karma. Though I am their creator, know Me as non-agent and immutable.
4.13 The four castes have been created by Me through a classification of the gunas and duties. Even though I am the agent of that (act of classification), still know Me to be a non-agent and changeless.
4.13 The whole universe beginning with Brahma and ending with a cluster of grass, with the system of four stations divided according to Sattva and other Gunas and by actions like self-control corresponding to the Gunas, was created by Me. The mention of 'creation' is for illustration. The universe is protected by Me alone and is withdrawn by Me alone. Know Me to be the creator of his manifold actions of creation etc., but at the same time to be non-agent.

Sri Krsna explains here how this is possible.
4.13 See Comment under 4.14
4.13 Catur-varnyam-meaning the same as catvarah varnah, the four castes; srstam, have been created; maya, by Me who am God, which accords with such Vedic texts as, 'The Brahmanas were His face৷৷.' (Rg. 10.90.12); guna-karma-vibhagasah, through a classification of the gunas and duties. [A.G. writes: guna-vibhagena karma-vibhagah, classification of the duties, determined by the classification of the gunas.-Tr] By the gunas are meant sattva, rajas and tamas (see note under 2.45; also see Chapter 14).
As to that, the control of the mind and body, austerity, etc. are the duties of the Brahmanas, who are sattvika, i.e. have a predominance of the ality of sattva (purity, goodness, etc.). Courage, valour, etc. are the duties of the Ksatriyas, in whom sattva becomes secondary and rajas (passion, attachment, etc.) preponderates. Agriculture etc. are the duties of the Vaisya, in whom tamas (indolence, ignorance, etc.) is secondary and rajas is predominant. Service is the only duty of the Sudra, in whom rajas is secondary and tamas predominates (see chapters 14, 16,17 and 18). In this way, the four castes have been created by Me through a classification of the gunas and duties. This is the idea. And these four castes do not prevail in the other worlds. Hence the specification, 'in the human world'.
'Well, in that caste, by virtues of Your being he agent of the acts of creation of the four castes,etc. You become subject tothe conseence of those actions? Therefore you are not eternally free and the eternal Lord!'
This is being answered: Api, even though; I am kartaram, the agent; tasya, of that act, from the empirical standpoint of maya; still, from the highest standpoint, viddhi, know; mam, Me; to be akartaram, a non-agent; and therefore, also know Me to be avyayam, changeless, not subject to the cycle of births and deaths.
'In reality, however, I am not the agent of those actions of which you think I am the agent.'
Because
4.14 Actions do not taint Me, nor have I a desire for the fruit of actions. He who knows Me thus is not bound by actions.
4.14 My actions do not fetter Me, nor do I desire anything that they can bring. He who thus realises Me is not enslaved by action.
4.14. Actions do not stain Me; nor do I have a desire for the fruits [of actions] also.  Whosoever comprehends Me as such, he is not bound by actions.
4.14 Works do not contaminate Me. In Me there is no desire for fruits of actions. He who understands Me thus is not bound by actions.
4.14 Actions do not taint Me; for Me there is no hankering for the results of actions. One who knows Me thus, does not become bound by actions.
4.14 These actions of varied nature like creation etc., do not contaminate Me i.e., do not bind Me. For the distinctions of gods, men etc., are not brought about by Me, but by the particular Karmas, good and evil, of created beings. Therefore by the process of discriminating between the acired and the inherent, it will be found that I am not the author of this varied creations etc. The created or embodied selves, who are endowed with bodies and organs at the time of creation in accordance with their own Karmas springing from attachment to fruits etc., experience all enjoyments available in creation. Thus for them (embodied selves) alone there is desire for the results of creation etc., and for the results of their Karmas. There is no desire in Me for it.

The Sutrakara says to the same effect:  'No partiality or cruelty on account of there being dependence (on the Karma of souls for inealities' (Br. S., 2.1.34). Bhagavan Parasara also says so:  'He (the Lord) is only the operative cause in the creation of beings. That from which the creative forces spring constitutes the material cause. Leaving aside the material cause, the being that becomes embodied does not reire the help of any other thing whatever. A thing is led into the condition in which it is, O best of ascetics, only by its own potentiality' (V. P., 1.4.51-2). The Supreme Person is only the operative cause with regard to the creation of those to be created, i.e., the selves in the bodies of gods etc. The material cause for the differences into gods etc., is the potentiality in the form of previous Karmas of the selves to be created. Therefore, leaving aside the operative cause, i.e., the Supreme Person, the creator, the embodied beings do not reire anything else for causing difference into conditions of gods etc. For these selves are led to take the forms of gods etc., by the potentiality of their own old Karma with which they are connected. Such is the meaning.

He who knows Me thus to be the agent of creation etc., and still a non-agent, i.e., as one who has no desire for the results of the acts of creation etc., - such a person is not tied by previous actions, i.e., he is freed from the old Karmas which obstruct the undertaking of Karma Yoga by causing attachment to results. Such is the purport.
4.13-14 Catur-varnyam etc.  Na mam etc.  How can there be taint of  actions in Me Who remain like the ether ?  The comparison with ether is due to the absence of desire  [in both].  As such etc. :  whosoever, with this sort of thought, takes refuge in the Bhagavat i.e.  contemplates  everywhere at all times on the Bliss-dense  Supreme  Lord as  'There exits nothing othe than Vasudeva  [the Absolute]' - for him can there be any bondage by actions ?
4.14 Because of the absence of egoism, those karmani, actions; na limpanti, do not taint; mam, Me, by becoming the originators of body etc. And me, for Me; na sprha, there is no hankering for the results of those actions. But in the case of transmigrating beings, who have self-identification in the form, 'I am the agent', and thirst for actions as also for their results, it is reasonable that actions should taint them. Owing to the absence of these, actions do not taint Me. Anyone else, too, yah, who; abhijanati, knows; mam, Me; iti, thus, as his own Self, and (knows), 'I am not an agent; I have no hankering for the results of actions'; sah, he; na badhyate, does not become bound; karmabhih, by actions. In his case also actions cease to be the originators of body etc. This is the import.
4.15 Having known this, the ancient seekers after freedom also performed action; therefore do thou also perform action, as did the ancients in days of yore.
4.15 In the light of wisdom, our ancestors, who sought deliverance, performed their acts. Act thou also, as did our fathers of old.
4.15. Realizing in this  fashion, action had been under-taken also by ancient seekers of salvation.  Hence, you too should perform, by all means, the more ancient action that had been performed by the ancients.
4.15 Knowing thus, even ancient seekers for liberation and work. Therefore, do your wok only as the ancients did in olden times.
4.15 Having known thus, duties were performed even by the ancient seekers of Liberation. Thererfore you undertake action itself as was performed earlier by the ancient ones.
4.15 Actions of the kind described above were performed even by the aspirants of old for liberation, who have become free from evil after knowing Me in this way. Therefore, after having got rid of the sins by knowledge of Me in the aforesaid way, perform actions in the same way as they were performed by those ancients like Vivasvan, Manu etc., in olden times, in the way in which their performance was taught by Me even then. I shall declare it again in what follows.

Sri Krsna stresses the difficulty of undertaking the type of Karma that is going to be taught now.
4.15 Evam etc.  Therefore being purified by this  [sort of]  conviction you too should  perform  actions that are to be necessarily performed.			
 But, if it is said that success would result just from the non-performance of action,  that is not correct.  For -
4.15 Jnatva, having known; evam, thus, that 'I am not an agent; I have no desire for the results of actions'; karma, duties; krtam, were undertaken; api, even; purvaih, by the ancient; mumuksubhih, seekers of Liberation. Tasmat, therefore; tvam, you; kuru, undertake; karma, action; eva, itself. You ought not to sit ietly, or even renounce. Therefore, you (undertake actions) because they were performed by the ancients as well-if you have no Self-knowledge, then (undertake actions) for self-purification; or, if you have Self-knowledge, then (undertake actions) in order to prevent people from going astray-, as were krtam, performed; purvataram, earlier; purvaih, by the ancient ones, Janaka and others; not actions as are undertaken in the present day. [This last portion of the sentence is translated by some as follows: You should not undertake actions which are done in the present manner (i.e. do not perform actions in the manner undertakne by people nowadays, which neither purifies the mind nor helps people). (See G1. Pr. p. 114.)
'If action has to be undertaken here, then I shall do so following Your instruction itself. What is the use of specifying that it was done earlier by the ancient ones?' 'The answer is: Because there is a great difficult as regards actions.' How?
4.16 What is action? What is inaction? As to this even the wise are confused. Therefore I shall teach thee such action (the nature of action and inaction) by knowing which thou shalt be liberated from the evil (of Samsara, the wheel of birth and death).
4.16 What is action and what is inaction? It is a question which has bewildered the wise. But I will declare unto thee the philosophy of action, and knowing it, thou shalt be free from evil.
4.16. Even the wise are perplexed about what is action and what is non-action; I shall preperly teach you the action,  by knowing which you shall be freed from evil.
4.16 What is action?  What is non-action?  Even the wise are puzzled in respect of these. I shall declare to you that kind of action by knowing which you will be freed from evil.
4.16 Even the intelligent are confounded as to what is action and what is inaction. I shall tell you of that action by knowing which you will become free from evil.
4.16 What is the form of the action which should be done by an aspirant for liberation?  And what is non-action?  Knowledge about the true nature of the acting self, is spoken of as non-action. The wise, even the learned scholars, are puzzled, i.e., do not truly know, both these - the proper form of the actions to be performed and the proper form of knowledge included in it. I shall teach you that action which includes knowledge within itself. Knowing, i.e., following it, you will be released from evil, i.e., from the bondage of Samsara. Knowledge about the work to be performed results in its performance.

Why is it so difficult to know this Karma?  Sri Krsna replies:
4.16 See Comment under 4.17
4.16 Kavayah api, even the intelligent; mohitah, are confounded in this subject of action etc.; iti atra, as to; kim karma, what is action; and kim akarma, what is inaction. Therefore, pravaksyami, I shall tell; te, you; of karma, action; akarma ca, as also of inaction; jnatva, by knowing; yat, which-action etc.; moksyase, you will become free: asubhat, from evil, from transmigration.
'And you should not think thus: What is called karma is the movement of the body etc. as are well-known in the world; and akarma, inaction, is not doing those, (i.e.) sitting ietly. What is there to understand (further) in that regard?' 'Why?' The answer is:
4.17 For verily (the true nature) of action (enjoined by the scriptures) should be known, also (that) 
of forbidden (or unlawful) action, and of inaction; hard to understand is the nature (path) of action.
4.17 It is necessary to consider what is right action, what is wrong action, and what is inaction, for mysterious is the law of action.
4.17. Something has got to be understand of [good] action also;  and something is to be understood of the wrong action; and something is to be understood of non-action. Difficult is to comprehend the way of action.
4.17 For, there is what ought to be known in action. Likewise there is what ought to be known in multi-form action. And there is what ought to be understood in non-action. Thus mysterious is the way of action.
4.17 For there is something to be known even about action, and something to be known about prohibited action; and something has to be known about inaction. The true nature of action is inscrutable.
4.17 There is something which ought to be known in regard to action (Karma) which forms the means of attaining release. So also is the case in regard to 'multi-form or varied forms of action' (Vikarma). These are what have acired variegation as obligatory, occasional and desire-prompted works reiring numerous reisites. There is also something to be known about non-action, i.e., knowledge of the self. Therefore, deep, i.e., difficult to understand, is the way of action to be pursued by the seeker after release. What should be known as regards multi-form or variegated forms of Karma is that the attribution of differences leading to differences of fruits in obligatory, occasional and desire-prompted rites and acisition of things reired for their performace, etc., must be renounced, realising that the Sastras aim at only one result, i.e., release (and not several results said to accrue from these works). This has been declared in connection with the teaching, 'The resolute mind is one-pointed' (2.41) and is not elaborated here.

Sri Krsna explains what must be known in regard to action and non-action.
4.16-17 Kim  karma etc.  Karmanah  etc.  The classification of  [good]  action  and  non-action  is difficult to comprehend.  That is to say  there is bad  action  even among the action  that  has been  ordained [in the scriptures], just as the animal-slaughter  in the [pious]  Agnistoma  sacrifice.  Again, even in the  midst of action,  that goes against  [the scripture],  there is  auspicious  action;  for example there is an end for the trouble of the people in the act of  killing	 a murderous animal.  Even in the case of non-performance of action,  there do exist  [both]  the auspicious and inauspicious acts;  for there will be necessarily  [some]  acts performed  by the sense of speech  and by the mind  as they are  difficult to avoid  without  wisdom.  Therefore on account  of its mysterious nature, even hte experts have not properly understood the action as :  'Prosperity  would be for as by this  [particular]  auspicious  action;  and emancipation would be for us by that  [particular]  non-undertaking  of [certain]  actions'.  Therefore,  it is the fire of wisdom  taught  in the seel,  that alone is capable  of positively  burning  down the  fuel of all the auspicious  and inauspicious  actions;  and hence  that is to be  sought after as a refuge.  This is what is intended by the  Bhagavat.		
 In order to calrify the same,  [the Lord] says -
4.17 Hi, for; there is something boddhavyam, to be known; api, even; karmanah, about action enjoined by the scriptures; and there is certainly something to be known vikarmanah, about prohibited action; so, also, there is something to be known akarmanah, about inaction, about sitting ietly. (The words 'there is' are to be supplied in all the three cases.) Because gatih, the true nature, i.e. the essential nature; karmanah, of action-implying karma etc., viz action, prohibited action and inaction; is gahana, inscrutable, hard to understand.
'What, again, is the essential nature of action etc. which has to be understood, and about which it was promised, "I shall tell you৷৷." (16)?' This is being stated:
4.18 He who seeth inaction in action and action in inaction, he is wise among men; he is a Yogi and performer of all actions.
4.18 He who can see inaction in action, and action in inaction, is the wisest among men. He is a saint, even though he still acts.
4.18. He, who finds non-action in the action, and action in the non-action, is an intelligent one, among men and is said to be a performer or destroyer of all actions.
4.18 He who sees non-action in action and also action in non-action is wise among men. He is fit for release and has carried out all actions.
4.18 He who finds inaction in action, and action in inaction, he is the wise one [Possessed of the knowledge of Brahman] among men; he is engaged in yoga and is a performer of all actions!
4.18 Here by the term 'non-action', the knowledge of the self, which is distinct from action and which forms the subject under consideration, is meant. 'He who sees non-action in action and also action in non-action,' denotes him who can perceive knowledge of the self even while action is being performed and who can also perceive action while engaged in non-action, i.e., knowledge of the self. What is the import of this saying?  What is taught here is this:  One can perceive, by constant contemplation on the truth about the self, that the action that is being performed in itself is a form of knowledge. One can also perceive that this knowledge is also of the form of Karma because of its being contained in Karma Yoga. Both these (i.e., action in the form of knowledge and knowledge in the form of actions) are accomplished by contemplation on the true nature of the self, even while work is being performed. Thus, he who can see actions as included in contemplation on the reality of the self, is wise, i.e., he knows the full meaning of the Sastras; he is fit among men, i.e., fit to attain release. He alone has fulfilled all actions, i.e., carried out the entire purpose of the Sastras. [The purport is that no contradiction between knowledge and action is felt by one who knows the philosophy of the self].

How is the form of knowledge accomplished through works which are obviously activities that are being performed?  Sri Krsna explains:
4.18 Karmani etc :  He who finds the actions,  [seemingly]  of his own,  to be non-actions [of his], on account  of his being  non-performer  [of any action], because of his state of  total  tranility;  and he who recognises  the non-actions  [of his]  i.e.,  the actions  performed  by others,  as actions  being performed  by himself  (or who  recognises the  non-actions undertaken by others as being undertaken   by himself), because  of his intrinsic  nature of the fully  risen  state;  that person  alone  is a man of  intelligence in the  midst of all;  and  he [alone]  performs  action fully i.e., in its entirity.  Therefore  what fruit  should be  borne  for him by what action ?  This is  at the stage  of rising.  But, at  the stage  of  total  tranility  he injures, or cuts all actions.  Thus he performs  all action  or performs  no action.  This is the secret  and sacred  knowledge,  got by sitting near  (by serving)  the feet  of the  preceptors.					
 Therefore -
4.18 Since engagement and non-engagement (in action) depend on an agent, therefore, yah, he who; pasyet, ie. pasyati, finds; akarma, inaction, absence of action; karmani, in action-karma means whatever is done, action in general; in tha action-; and yah, who; finds karma, action; akarmani, in inaction, in the absence of action; sah, he; is buddhiman, a wise one; manusyesu, among men. All dealings involving an act, accessories, etc. exist certainly on the plane of ignorance, [Both engagement and non-engagement presuppose agentship and an act of some kind. This, however, holds good on the plane of ignorance, but not on that of Self-realization.] only so long as one has not attained to the Reality. He is a yogi, yuktah, engaged in yoga; and a krtsna-karma-krt, performer of all actions. One who discriminates between action and actions. One who discriminates between action and inaction is praised thus.
Objection: Well, what is meant by this contradictory statement, 'He who finds inaction in action', and 'action in inaction'? For action cannot become inaction, nor inaction action. That being so, how can a witness have (such) an incongruous perception?
Vedantin: Is it not that [Ast. reads na in place of nanu.-Tr.] to an ordinary foolsih observer, that which is reality is inaction appears as action, and similarly, action itself as inaction? That being so, in order to show things as they are the Lord says, 'He who finds inaction in action', etc. Therefore there is no incongruity. Besides, the alifications such as 'intelligent' etc. (thus) become logical. And by saying, 'there is something to be known', is implied the perception of things as they are. Moreover, freedom from evil cannot follow from an erroneous perception; whereas it has been said, 'by knowing which you will become free from evil'. Therefore, one account of action and inaction being perceived contrarily by the creatures, the Lord's utterance, 'he who finds inaction in action,' etc. is for dispelling their contrary perception.
Not that in the empirical plane inaction has action as its receptacle, like a plum in a bowl! Nor even has action inaction as its receptacle, because inaction is a negation of action. Therefore, action and inaction are actually perceived contrarily by the ordinary persons-like seeing water in a mirage, or silver in nacre.
Objection: Is it not that to every one action is action itself? Never is there an exception to this. 
Vedantin: That is not so, becuase when a boat is moving, motionless trees on the bank appear to move in the opposite direction to a man on the boat; an absence of motion is noticed in distant moving things which are not near one's eyes. Similarly, here also occurs the contrary perceptions, viz seeing action in inaction under the idea, 'I am doing', [Ast. omits 'aham karomi iti, under the idea, "I am doing"'.-Tr.] and seeing, inaction in acion,-because of which it is said, 'He who finds inaction in action,' etc. in order to eliminate them. As such, although this answer has been given more than once, still a man becomes repeatedly deluded under the influence of a totally opposite perception. And forgetting the truth that has been heard again and again, he repeatedly raises false issues and estions! And therefore, observing that the subject is difficult to understand, the Lord gives His answer again and again.
The absence of action in the Self-well-known from the Vedas, Smrtis and logic, as stated in, '(It is said that) This is unmanifest; This is inconceivable' (2.25), 'Never is this One born, and never does It die' (2.20; Ka. 1.2.18), etc.-has been and will be spoken of. The contrary perception of action in that actionless Self, i.e. in inaction, is very deep-rooted, owing to which 'even the intelligent are confounded as to what is action and what is inaction.' And as a conseence of the superimposition of aciton pertaining to the body etc. on the Self, there arises such ideas as, 'I am an agent; this is my action; its result is to be enjoyed by me.' Similarly, with the idea, 'I shall remain iet, whery I shall be free from exertion, free from activity, and happy', and superimposing on the Self the cessation of activities pertaining to the body and organs and the resulting happiness, a man imagines, 'I shall not do anything; I shall sit ietly and happily.'
That being so, the Lord says, 'he who finds inaction in action,' etc. with a view to removing this contrary understanding of man. And here in this world, though action belonging to the body and organs continues to be action, still it is superimposed by everyone on the acitonless, unchanging Self, as a result of which even a learned person things, 'I act.'
Therefore, in action (karmani), which is universally considered by all people to be inherent in the Self, like the perception of motion in the (stationary) trees on the bank of a river-(in that action) he who contrariwise finds the fact of inaction, like perceiving absence of motion in those trees-.
And, in inaction (akarmani) in the cessation of the activities pertaining to the body and organs and ascribed to the Self in the same way that actions are ascribed-, in that action, he who sees action because of egoism being implicit in the idea, 'I am happily seated ietly, without doing anything'-; he who knows thus the distinction between action and inaction, is wise, is learned among men; he is engaged in yoga, he is a yogi, and a performer of all actions. And he, freed from evil, attains fulfilment. This is the meaning.
This verse is interpreted by some in another way. 
How?
(Thus:) 'Since the daily obligatory duties (nityakarmas) certainly have no results when performed as a dedication to God, therefore, in a secondary sense, they are said to be inaction. Again, the non-performance of these (nitya-karmas) is inaction; since this produces an evil result, therefore it is called action, verily in a figurative sense. That being so, he who sees inaction in the daily obligatory duties (nitya-karmas) owing to the obsence of their results-in the same way as a cow that does not yield milk is said to be not a cow, though in reality it is so-so also, in the non-performance of the daily obligatory duties, i.e. in inaction, he who sees action since that yields results such as hell etc৷৷.'
This explanation is not logical, because freedom from evil as a result of such knowledge is unreasonable, and the utterance of the Lord in the sentence, '৷৷.by knowing which you will become freed from evil', will be contradicted.
How?
Even if it be that liberation from evil follows from the performance of nitya-karmas, it cannot, however, follow from the knowledge of the absence of their results. For it has not been enjoined (anywhere) that knowledge of the nityakarmas (themselves), leads to the result of freedom from evil. Nor has this been stated here by the Lord Himself.
Hery is refuted the 'seeing of action in inaction' [As explained by others.-Tr.], for (according to the opponent) 'seeing of action in inaction' has not been enjoined here [Here, in the present verse.] as a duty, but (what has been enjoined is) merely that performance of the nityakarmas is obligatory. Moreover, no result can accrue from the knowledge that evil arises from non-performance of nityakramas. Nor even has non-performance of nityakarmas. been enjoined as something that should be known. Besides, such results as freedom from evil, wisdom, engagement in yoga, and being a performer of all actions cannot reasonably follow from a false perception of action as inaction. Nor is this a eulogy of false perception. [The stated results accrue from correct knowledge, not from false perception; and correct knowledge alone is praise-worthy.] Indeed, false perception is itself an abvious form of evil! How can it bring about liberation from another evil? Surely, darkness does not become the remover of darkness!
Opponent: Well, the seeing of inaction in action, or the seeing of action in inaction-that is not a false perception.
Vadantin: What then?
Opponent: It is a figurative statement based on the existence or the non-existence of results.
Vedantin: Not so, because there is no such scriptural statement that something results from knowing action as inaction and inaction as action, even in a figurative sense. Besides, nothing particular is gained by rejecting what is heard of (in the scriptures) and imagining something that is not. Further, it was possible (for the Lord) to express in His own words that there is no result from the nityakarmas, and that by their non-performance one would have to go to hell. Under such circumstances, what was the need of the ambiguous statement, 'He who sees inaction in action,' etc., which is misleading to others?
This being the case, such an explanation by anyone will be clearly tantamount to imagining that statement of the Lord as meant for deluding people. Moreover, this subject-matter (performance of nityakarmas) is not something to be protected with mystifying words. It is not even logical to say that the subject-matter will become easy for comprehension if it is stated again and again through different words. For, the subject-matter that was stated more clearly in, 'Your right is for action alone' (2.47), does not need any repetition. And everwhere it is said that whatever is good and ought to be practised deserves to be understood; anything purposeloss does not deserve to be known. Besides, neither is false knowledge worth aciring nor is the semblance of an object presented by it worth knowing.
Nor even can any evil, which is an entity, arise from the non-performance of nityakarmas, which is a non-entity, for there is the statement, 'Of the unreal there is no being' (2.16), and (in the Upanisad) it has been pointed out, 'How can existence originate from nonexistence?' (Ch. 4.2.2). Since emergence of the existent from the nonexistent has been denied, therefore anyone's assertion that the existent originates from the nonexistent will amount to saying that a non-entity becomes an entity, and an entity becomes a non-entity! And that is not rational because it runs counter to all the means of valid knowledge.
Further, the scriptures cannot enjoin fruitless actions, they being naturally painful; and it is illogical that what is painful should be done intentionally. Also, if it is admitted that falling into hell results from their non-performance (i.e. of the nityakarmas), then that too is surely a source of evil. In either case, whether one undertakes them or not, the scriptures will be imagined to be useless. And there will be a contradiction with your own standpoint when, after holding that the nityakarmas are fruitless, you assert that they lead to Liberation.
Therefore, the meaning of 'He who finds inaction in action,' etc. is just what stands out literally. And the verse has been explained by us accordingly.
The aforesaid perception of 'inaction in action,' etc. is being praised:
4.19 He whose undertakings are all devoid of desires and (selfish) purposes and whose actions have been burnt by the fire of knowledge,  him the wise call a sage.
4.19 The wise call him a sage, for whatever he undertakes is free from the motive of desire, and his deeds are purified by the fire of Wisdom.
4.19. He, whose every exertion is devoid of intention for the desirable objects, and whose actions are burnt up by the fire of wisdom-him the wise call a man of learning.
4.19 He whose every undertaking is free from desire and delusive identification (of the body with the self), whose actions are burnt up in the fire of knowledge - him the wise describe as a sage.
4.19 The wise call him learned whose actions are all devoid of desires and their thougts, [Kama-sankalpa is variously translated as 'desires and purposes', 'plans and desires for results', 'hankering for desires', etc. But Sankarcarya shows sankalpa as the cause of kama. -Tr.] and whose actions have been burnt away by the fire of wisdom.
4.19 In the case of an aspirant for release, all undertakings of actions in the form of obligatory, occasional and desiderative acts accomplished through the acisition of materials for their performance as also other works, are free from desire, i.e., are devoid of attachment to fruits. They are devoid of delusive identification. If the mind identifies the self with Prakrti and its Gunas, it is Sankalpa, i.e., 'delusive identification.' Genuine Karma Yoga is free from such identification. Such identification is overcome through contemplation on the real nature of the self as different from Prakrti. Those who know the truth call him a sage, who acts in this way and whose previous Karmas are thery burnt up by the fire of knowledge of the real nature of the self generated along with his actions. He is a true Karma Yogin.

Thus that knowledge is involved in true Karma Yoga, is established.

Sri Krsna elaborates this point again:
4.19 Yasya etc.  The actions,  performed  without intention for the desirable objects, - i.e.,  the fruits desired  for - are burnt up by putting them into the fire of wisdom, the nature of  which has been earlier described , and also is to be described  in the seel.
4.19 Budhah, the wise, the knowers of Brahman; ahuh, call; tam, him; panditam, learned, in the real sense; yasya, whose, of the one who perceives as stated above; samarambhah, actions-whatever are undertaken; are sarve, all; kama-sankalpa-varjitah, devoid of desires and the thoughts which are their (desires') causes (see 2.62)-i.e., (those actions) are performed as mere movements, without any selfish purpose: if they are performed by one (already) engaged in actions, then they are for preventing people from going astray, and if they are done by one who has withdrawn from actions, then they are merely for the maintenance of the body-; and jnanagni-dagdha-karmanam, whose actions have been burnt away by the fire of wisdom.
Finding inaction etc. in action etc. is jnana, wisdom; that itself is agnih, fire. He whose actions, karma, described as good and bad, have been dagdhani, burnt away by that fire of wisdom, is jnana-agni-dagdha-karma.
However, one who is a perceiver of 'inaction' etc. [Perceiver of inaction etc.: He who knows the truth about action and inaction as explained before.-Tr.] is free from actions owing to the very fact of his seeing 'inaction' etc. He is a monk, who acts merely for the purpose of maintaining the body. Being so, he does not engage in actions although he might have done so before the dawn of discrimination. He again who, having been engaged in actions under the influence of past tendencies, later on becomes endowed with the fullest Self-knowledge, he surely renounces (all) [Ast. adds this word sarva, all.-Tr.] actions along with their accessories as he does nnot find any purpose in activity. For some reason, if it becomes impossible to renounce actions and he, for the sake of preventing people from going astray, even remains engaged as before in actions-without attachment to those actions and their results because of the absence of any selfish purpose-, still he surely does nothing at all! His actions verily become 'inaction' because of having been burnt away by the fire of wisdom.
By way of pointing out this idea, the Lord says:
4.2 This, handed down thus in regular succession, the royal sages knew. This Yoga, by long lapse of time, has been lost here, O Parantapa (burner of the foes).
4.2 The Divine Kings knew it, for it was their tradition. Then, after a long time, at last it was forgotten.
4.2. Thus the regal sages knew this,  received in regualr succession.  By the passage of long time,  this Yoga has been however lost,  O scorcher of enemies !
4.2 Thus handed down in succession, the royal sages knew this (Karma Yoga). But with long lapse of time, O Arjuna, that Yoga was lost to the world.
4.2 The king-sages knew this (yoga) which was received thus in regular succession. That Yoga, O destroyer of foes, in now lost owing to a long lapse of time.
4.1 - 4.2 The Lord said  This Karma Yoga declared to you should not be considered as having been taught now merely, for creating encouragement in you for war. I Myself had taught this Yoga to Vivasvan at the commencement of Manu's age as a means for all beings to attain release, which is man's supreme end. Vivasvan taught it to Manu, and Manu to Iksvaku. The royal sages of old knew this Yoga transmitted by tradition. Because of long lapse of time and because of the dullness of the intellect of those who heard it, it has been almost lost.

4.2 Rajarsayah, the king-sages, those who were kings and sages (at the same time); viduh, knew; imam, this Yoga; which was evam parampara-praptam, received thus through a regular succession of Ksatriyas. Sah, that; yogah, Yoga; nastah, is lost, has go its traditional line snapped; iha, now; mahata kalena, owing to a long lapse of time. parantapa, O destroyer of foes. By para are meant those against oneself. He who, like the sun, 'scorches' (tapayati) them by the 'rays' of the 'heat' of his prowess is parantapa, i.e. scorcher of antagonists.
Noticing that the Yoga has got lost by reaching people who are weak and have no control of their organs, and that the world has become associated with goals that do not lead to Liberation,
4.20 Having abandoned attachment to the fruits of the action, ever content, depending on nothing, he does not do anything though engaged in activity.
4.20 Having surrendered all claim to the results of his actions, always contented and independent, in reality he does nothing, even though he is apparently acting.
4.20. By abandoning attachment for fruits of actions, remaining ever content and depending on nothing, that person, even though he is engaged in action, does not at all perform anything.
4.20 Having renounced attachment to the fruits of his actions, ever contented with the eternal self, and dependent on none, one does not act at all, even though engaged in action.
4.20 Having given up attachment to the results of action, he who is ever-contented, dependent on nothing, he really does not do anything even though engaged in action.
4.20 Whoever performs actions, renouncing attachment to their fruits and is satisfied with the eternal, i.e., satisfied with his own self, and dependent on none, i.e., devoid of dependence on transient Prakrti (body and external nature) - such a perosn, even though fully engaged in actions, does not act at all. He is engaged in the practice of knowledge under the form of action.

Again, Karma, having the form of knowledge, is examined:
4.20 See Comment under 4.21
4.20 With the help of the above-mentioned wisdom, tyaktva, having given up the idea of agentship; and phala-asangam, attachment to the results of action; he who is nitya-trptah, ever-trptah, ever-contented, i.e. has no hankering for objects; and nirasrayah, dependent on nothing-. Asraya means that on which a person leans, desiring to achieve some human goal. The idea is that he is dependent of any support which may be a means of attaining some coveted seen or unseen result. 
In reality, actions done by a man of Knowledge are certainly inactions, since he is endowed with the realization of the actionless Self. Actions together with their accessories must be relinished by one who has become thus, because they have no end to serve. This being so, api, even though; he remains abhi-pravrttah, engaged as before; karmani, in actions-getting out of those (actions) being impossible-, either with the intention of preventing people from going astray or with a view to avoiding the censure of the wise people; sah, he; eva, really; na karoti, does not do; kincit, anything, because he is endued with the realization of the actionless Self. [From the subjective standpoint of the enlightened there are no actions, but ordinary people mistakenly think them to be actions, which in reality are a mere semblance of it.]
On the other hand, one who is the opposite of the above-mentioned one, (and) in whom, even before undertaking works, has dawned the realization of his identity with Brahman, the all-pervasive, inmost, actionless Self; who,being bereft of solicitation for desirable objects seen or unseen, has renounced actions along with their accessories, by virtue of seeing no purpose to be served by undertaking actions meant to secure some seen or unseen result, and makes effort only for the maintenance of the body, he, the monk steadfast in Knowledge, becomes free.
Hence, in order to express this idea the Lord says:
4.21 Without hope and with the mind and the self controlled, having abandoned all covetousness, doing mere bodily action, he incurs no sin.
4.21 Expecting nothing, his mind and personality controlled, without greed, doing bodily actions only; though he acts, yet he remains untainted.
4.21. Being rid of cravings,  having mind and self (body) all controlled, abandoning all sense of possession, and performing exclusively bodily action, he does not incur any sin.
4.21 Free from desire, his intellect and mind controlled, giving up all possessions, and doing bodily work only, he is not subject to evil:
4.21 One who is without solicitation, who has the mind and organs under control, (and) is totally without possessions, he incurs no sin by performing actions merely for the (maintenance of the) body.
4.21 'Free from desire' means having no attachment to the fruits of actions. 'His intellect and mind controlled' means one whose intellect and mind are under control. 'Giving up all possessions' means one who, on account of his having the self as his primary objective, is devoid of the sense of ownership in relation to Prakrti and its derivatives. One who is thus engaged in bodily work alone as long as he lives, does not incur any sin, i.e., does not get engrossed in Samsara. He gets the vision of the self by Karma Yoga of this kind itself, and need not resort to any exlusive practice of Jnana Yoga in between liberation and the practice of Karma Yoga of the alone description.
4.21 Tyaktva etc.  Nirasih  etc.  Even  though  he sets upon :  Even though he is directly exerting in.  Bodily action :  the  action which  is in the form of activity of the organs for simply maintaining the body,  and which  is not coloured  (desired)  so much  by the mind and intellect.
4.21 Nirasih, one who is without solicitation-one from whom asisah [Asih is a kind of desire that can be classed under prayer. (Some translate it as desire, hope.-Tr.)], solicitations, have departed; yata-citta-atma, who has the mind and organs under control-one by whom have been controlled (yatau) both the internal organ (citta) and the external aggregate of body and organs (atma); (and) is tyakta-sarva-parigrahah, [ Parigraha: receiving, accepting, possessions, belongings.-V.S.A] totally without possessions- one by whom have been renounced (tyaktah) all (sarvah) possessions (parigrahah); na apnoti, he does not incur; kilbisam, sin, in the form of evil as also rigtheousness-to one aspiring for Liberation, even righteousness is surely an evil because it brings bondage-; [Here Ast. adds tasmat tabhyam mukto bhavati samsarat mukto bhavati ityarthah, therefore, he becomes free from both of them, i.e. he becomes liberated from transmigration.-Tr.] kurvan, by performing; karma, actions; kevalam, merely; sariram, for the purpose of maintaining the body-without the idea of agenship even with regard to these (actions).
Further, in the expression, 'kevalam sariram karma', do the words sariram karma mean 'actions done by the body' or 'actions merely for the purpose of maintaining the body? Again, what does it matter if by (the words) sariram karma is meant 'actions done by the body' or 'actions merely for the purpose of maintaning the body?
The answer is: If by sariram karma is meant actions done by the body, then it will amount to a contradiction [Contradiction of the scriptures.] when the Lord says, 'one does not incur sin by doing with his body any action meant for seen or unseen purposes, even though it be prohibited.' Even if the Lord were to say that 'one does not incur sin by doing with his body some scripturally sanctioned action intended to secure a seen or an unseen end', then there arises the contingency of His denying something (some evil) that has not come into being!
(Further,) from the specification, sariram karma kurvan (by doing actions with the body), and from the use of the word kevala (only), it will amount to saying that one incurs sin by performing actions, called righteous and unrighteous, which can be accomplished with the mind and speech and which come within the purview of injunction and prohibition. Even there, the statement that one incurs sin by performing enjoined actions through the mind and speech will involve a contradiction; even in the case of doing what is prohibited, it will amount to a mere purposeless restatement of a known fact.
On the other hand, when the sense conveyed by sariram karma is taken as acctions merely for the purpose of maintaining the body, then the implication will be that he does not do any other work as can be accomplished physically, orally, or mentally, which are known from injunctions and prohibitions (of the scriptures) and which have in view seen or unseen results; while he appears to people to be working with those very body (speech) etc. merely for the purpose of maintaining the body, yet he does not incur sin by merely making movements of the body etc., because from the use of the word kevala, (merely) it follows that he is devoid of the sense of agentship implicit in the idea, 'I do.' Since there is no possibility of a person who has reached such a state incurring evil as suggest by the word sin, therefore he does not become subject to the evil of transmigration. That is to say, he certainly becomes free without any obstacle since he has all his actions burnt away by the fire of wisdom.
This verse is only a reiteration of the result of full illumination stated earlier. It becomes faultless by accepting the interpretation of sariram karma thus. 
In the case of the monk who has renounced all possessions, since owning food etc. meant for the bare sustenance of the body is absent, therefore it becomes imperative to beg for alms etc. for the upkeep of the body. Under this circumstance, by way of pointing out the means of obtaining food etc. for the maintenance of the body of a monk as permitted by the text, 'What comes unasked for, without forethought and spontaneously৷৷.' [Unasked for: what comes before the monk gets ready for going out for alms; without forethought: alms that are not given with abuses, and have not fallen on the ground, but collected from five or seven houses without any plan; spontaneously: alms brought to one spontaneously by devoted people.] (Bo. Sm. 21. 8. 12) etc., the Lord says:
4.22 Content with what comes to him without effort, free from the pairs of opposites and envy, even-minded in success and failure, though acting, he is not bound.
4.22 Content with what comes to him without effort of his own, mounting above the pairs of opposites, free from envy, his mind balanced both in success and failure; though he acts, yet the consequences do not bind him.
4.22. Remaining contended wiht the gain brought by chance, transcending the dualities (pairs of opposites),  entertaining no jealously,  and remaning eal in success and in failure,  he does not get bound,  even when he acts.
4.22 Content with what chance may bring, rising above the pairs of opposites, free from ill-will, even-minded in success and failure, though he acts, he is not bound.
4.22 Remaining satisfied with what comes unasked for, having transcended the dualities, being free from spite, and eipoised under success and failure, he is not bound even by performing actions.
4.22 Content with whatever chance may bring for the maintenance of the body; 'rising above the pairs of opposites' means enduring cold, heat and such other experiences until one has completed the practice of Karma Yoga; 'free from ill-will?'  i.e., free from ill-will towards others, seeing his own Karma as the cause of his adversity; 'even-minded in success and failure,' i.e., even-minded at success like victory in war, etc., and failure therein - such a person 'is not bound,' i.e., he does not fall into Samsara, though devoted to action without any exclusive practice of Jnana Yoga.
4.22 Yadrccha-etc. He does not get bound even when he acts :  Here nibadhyate  'gets bound' is a usage of transitive  verb with its object functioning  as the subject.  [Hence] the meaning is :  The Self binds  Itself  by undertaking the dirt of mental impressions for fruits [of action].  Otherwise  [the usage  would amount  to attribute]  freedom of actions to the insentient in binding [the Self] - a proposition which is not a very happy one.
4.22 Yadrccha-labha-santustah, remaining satisfied with what comes unasked for-yadrccha-labha means coming to possess something without having prayed for it; feeling contented with that-. Dvandva-atitah,having transcended the dualities-one is said to be beyond dualities when his mind is not distressed even when afflicted by such opposites as heat and cold, etc.-. Vimatsarah, being free from spite, from the idea of enmity; and samah, eipoised; siddhau ca asiddhau, is success and failure, with regard to things that come unasked for-.
The monk who is such, who is eipoised, not delighted or sorrowful in getting or not getting food etc. for the sustenance of the body, who sees inaction etc. in action etc., who is ever poised in the realization of the Self as It is, who, with regard to the activities accomplished by the body etc. in the course of going about for alms etc. for the bare maintenance of the body, is ever clearly conscious of the fact, 'I certainly do not anything; the organs act on the objects of the organs' (see 5.8; 3.28), he, realizing the absence of agentship in the Self, certainly does not do any actions like going about for alms etc. But when, abserving similarly with common human behaviour, agentship is attributed to him by ordinary poeple, then he (apparently) becomes an agent with regard to such actions as moving about for alms etc. However, from the standpoint of his own realization which has arisen from the valid means of knowledge presented in the scriptures, he is surely not an agent.
He, to whom is thus ascribed agentship by others, na nibadhyate, is not bound; api, even; krtva, by performing such actions as moving about for alms merely for the maintenance of the body, because action which is a source of bondage has been burnt away along with its cause by the fire of wisdom. Thus, this is only a restatement of what has been said earilier. 
When a person who has already started works becomes endowed with the realization of the identity of the Self with the actionless Brahman, then it follows that in the case of that man, who has experienced the absence of agentship, actions and purposes in the Self, actions become relinished. But if this becomes impossible for some reason and he continues to be engaged in those acitons as before, still he certainly does not do anything. This absence of action has been shown in the verse, 'Having given up attachment to the results of action৷৷.' (20).
Of that very person with regard to whom has been shown the absence of aciton-
4.23 To one who is devoid of attchment, who is liberated, whose mind is established in knowledge, who works for the sake of sacrifice (for the sake of God), the whole action is dissolved.
4.23 He who is without attachment, free, his mind centered in wisdom, his actions, being done as a sacrifice, leave no trace behind.
4.23. The action gets dissolved completely in the case of the person who undertakes it for the sake of sacrifice;  who is rid of attachment and is freed; and who has his mind fixed in wisdom.
4.23 Of one whose attachments are gone, who is free, whose mind is established in knowledge, who works only for sacrifices, his Karma is entirely dissolved.
4.23 Of the liberated person who has got rid of attachment, whose mind is fixed in Knowledge, actions undertaken for a sacrifice get totally destroyed.
4.23 Of a person whose attachment to all objects is gone because of his mind being established in the knowledge of the self, who is therefore liberated from accepting all worldly possessions and who is engaged in the performance of sacrifices etc., as described above - in the case of such a person his beginningless load of Karma, which is the cause of his bondgae, is completely dissolved, i.e., destroyed without leaving any residue.

So far the nature of Karma as having the form of knowledge has been described as emerging from constant contemplation on the nature of the self as different from Prakrti. And now Sri Krsna says that all actions together with their ancillaries, have the form of knowledge because of constant contemplation by the aspirant on the Supreme Person who is the Supreme Brahman, as being his soul.
4.23 Gatasangasya etc. For sacrifice (yajnaya) :  The singular number is to be construed  with the class [yajnatva].  [Hence the meaning is] :  'The sacrifice'  that are being defined in the seel.						
 It has been said  'for the sake of sacrifice etc.'  Now their general nature,  [the Lord] describes :
4.23 Muktasya, of the liberated person who has become relieved of such bondages as righteousness and unrighteousness, etc.; gatasangasya, who has got rid of attachment, who has become detached from everything; jnana-avasthita-cetasah, whose mind is fixed in Knowledge only; his karma, actions; acaratah, undertaken; yajnaya, for a sacrifice, to accomplish a sacrifice [A.G. takes yajna to mean Visnu. So, yajnaya will mean 'for Visnu'. Sankaracarya also interprets this word similarly in 3.9.-Tr.]; praviliyate, gets destroyed; samagram, totally-saha (together) agrena (with its conseence, result). This is the meaning.
For what reason, again, does an action that is underway get destroyed totally without producing its result? This is being answered:
Because,
4.24 Brahman is the oblation; Brahman is the melted butter (ghee); by Brahman is the oblation poured into the fire of Brahman; Brahman verily shall be reached by him who always sees Brahman in action.
4.24 For him, the sacrifice itself is the Spirit; the Spirit and the oblation are one; it is the Spirit Itself which is sacrificed in Its own fire, and the man even in action is united with God, since while performing his act, his mind never ceases to be fixed on Him.
4.24. The Brahman-oblation that is to be offered ot the Brahman, is poured into the Brahman-fire by the Brahman;  it is nothing but the Brahman that is to be attained by him whose deep contemplation is the [said] Brahman-action.
4.24 Brahman is the instrument to offer with; Brahman is the oblation. By Brahman is the oblation offered into the fire of Brahman; Brahman alone is to be reached by him who meditates on Him in his works.
4.24 The ladle is Brahman [Some translate as 'Brahman is the ladle৷৷.,' etc.-Tr.], the oblations is Brahman, the offering is poured by Brahman in the fire of Brahman. Brahman alone is to be reached by him who has concentration on Brahman as the objective [As an object to be known and attained. (Some translate brahma-karma-samadhina as, 'by him who sees Brahman in action'.)
4.24 The expression 'Brahman is the instrument to offer with' (It is to be remembered that in Ramanuja's system 'Brahman' in the primary sense is the 'Whole' with the Supreme Being as the Soul and Atmans and Matter (Prakrti) as His body in inseparable union with the Whole. So the word 'Brahman' can, according to the needs of each context, be used to indicate the Supreme Being, the Atman, or Prakrti; In verse 24 it has been used in all these senses. We have therefore put it in italics. See Introduction.) is adjectival to 'the oblation'. That by which an offering is given, such as a ladle, is an Arpana. It is called Brahman because it is an effect of Brahman, Brahman being the material cause of the universe. 'Brahmaarpanam' is the oblation, of which the instrument is Brahman. The oblation, just like the instrument with which it is offered, is also Brahman. It is offered by the agent Brahman into the fire of Brahman. He is the Brahma-karma-samadhi who contemplates thus on all acts as filled with the Supreme Brahman or as having the Supreme Brahman as the Self. He who contemplates on Brahman as the Soul of all actions, reaches Brahman alone, as his own self has the Supreme Brahman as Its Self. The meaning is that the individual self - which is Brahman because of Its having Brahman as Its Self - has to realise Its own real nature. All actions performed by an aspirant for release have the form of knowledge because of their association with the contemplation of the Supreme Brahman as their self. They are a direct means for the vision of the self without the meditation of Jnana Yoga.

Thus, Sri Krsna, after explaining how Karma takes the form of knowledge, now speaks of the various kinds of Karma Yoga.
4.24 Brahmarpanam etc.  That is to be offered to the Brahman (list) :  that, the offering of which is in the  Brahman i.e.,  the reentrance of which is only into That, just from which it has originated.  The Brahman (2nd) :  That which is the same as the entire universe what we see - this is that very oblation. Into the Brahman-fire : into the fire which is the same as the Brahman,  the highly tranil  Supreme Consciousness.  By the  Brahman : by one or the other action.  Is poured : is offered  for the augmentation of It's lumination. Hence, a man of  Yoga,  whose Brahman-action of this sort is itself a deep concentration - by him,  the Brahman  alone is [a goal] to be attained i.e., to be realised, not anything else; for there is no other thing.
 
Alternatively [in the verse] the meaning  'by him' brings  in, by implication, the meaning  'by whom'.  So the following  is the alignment  [of words] :  The action,  in which the Brahman-oblation, intended to be an offering to a deity of the Brahman-nature, has been indeed poured into the Brahman-fire  by the sacrificer, identical with the Brahman - that very Brahman-action of this sort is itself a deep contemplaiton, because it is the means to gain the innate nature  of  the Self.  And what is attained by this Brahman-action-contemplation is the very Brahman Itself  and not any other fruit.  Indeed it has been maintained  [by the Lord]  as :
 
          'The way in which  men  resort to Me,
           [in the same way  I favour them]'. (IV, II) 
 
'Those, who have cultivated the nature of performing sacrifice which is nothing but Me, but of the  delimited nature - they attain, therefore, the fruit of similar  [limited]  nature.  This is different  matter.  But, with regard to those  who have realised  the nature  of the sacrifice identical  with Me ( the Supreme Consciousness),  the Unlimited and  complete;  how could they be entertaining a craving for a bit of limited fruit ?'  This is the idea here.
 
Thus, a  top secret is furnished  by this and by the succeeding  verses.  that has been also detailed by us (Ag.) - even though our intelligence is limited - as far as  our intelligence  permits, by not transgressing the instructions of our preceptors. Maybe,  for a person without a regular course of the oral tradition  [of the system],  this looks  like a picture painted on the sky and does not appeal to his mind.  On that account  we should not be blamed.
 
It has been declared by some, in this context, that [here in this verse]  the oblation, the fire and the instruments like sruk [used for offering the oblation into the fire in the sacrifice]  and also the act [of offering] are all adjectives alifying the Brahmam.  This  [explanation] deserves to be ignored.  For, these commentators have not troden on the path of the secret tradition.
4.24 Brahma-arpanam, the ladle is Brahman: The knower of Brahman perceives the instrument with which he offers oblation in the fire as Brahman Itself. He perceives it as not existing separately from the Self, as one sees the non-existence of silver in nacre. In this sense it is that Brahman Itself is the ladle-just as what appears as silver is only narcre. (The two words brahma and arpanam are not parts of a compound word, samasa.) The meaning is that, to a knower of Brahman, what is perceived in the world as ladle is Brahman Itself. 
Similarly, brahma-havih, the oblations is Brahman: To him, what is seen as oblations is nothing but Brahman.
In the same way, brahma-agnau, (-this is a compound word-) in the fire of Brahman: The fire into which oblation is hutam, poured; brahmana, by Brahman, by the agent, is Brahman Itself. The meaning is that Brahman Itself is the agent (of the offering). That he makes the offering-the act of offering-, that is also Brahman. And the result that is gantavyam, to be reached by him; that also is brahma eva, surely Brahman.
Brahma-karma-samadhina, by him who has concentration on Brahman as the objective: Brahman Itself is the objective (karma); he who has concentration (samadhi) on That is brahma-karma-samdhih. The goal to be reached by him is Brahman alone.
Thus, even the action undertaken by one who desires to prevent mankind from going astray is in reality inaction, for it has been sublated by the realization of Brahman. This being so, in the case of the monk from whom aciton has dropped off, who has renounced all activity, viewing his Knowledge as a (kind of) sacrifice, too, becomes all the more justifiable from the point of view of praising full realization.
That is, whatever is well known as ladle etc. in the context of a sacrifice, all that, in the context of the Self, is Brahman Itself to one who has realized the supreme Truth. If not so, then, since all in Brahman, it would have been uselesss to specifically mention ladle etc. as Brahman. Therefore, all actions cease to exist for the man of realization who knows that Brahman Itself is all this. And this follows also from the absence (in him) of the idea of accessories. [See note on p.211.-Tr.] For the act called 'sacarifice' is not seen to exist without being in association with the idea of accessories. All such acts as Agnihotra etc. are associated with the ideas of such accessories as making an offering etc. to the particular gods who are revealed in the scriptures, and with the idea of agentship as also desire for results. But they are not found bereft of the ideas of such distinctions as exist among action, accessories and results, or unassociated with the ideas of agentship hankering for results.
This (apparent) (activity of the man of Knowledge), however, stands dissociated from the ideas of differences among the accessories like ladle etc., actions and results, which get destroyed by the Knowledge of Brahman. Hence, it is inaction to be sure.
And thus has it been shown in, 'He who finds inaction in action' (18), 'he really does not do anything even though engaged in action' (20), 'the organs act on the objects of the organs' (3.28), 'Remaining absorbed in the Self, the knower of Reality should think, "I certainly do not do anything"' (5.8), etc. While pointing out thus, the Lord demolishes in various places the ideas of differences among actions, accessories and results. And it is also seen in the case of rites such as Agnihotra undertaken for results (kamya), that the Agnihotra etc. cease to be (kamya) rites undertaken for selfish motives when the desire for their results is destroyed. Similarly, it is seen that actions done intentionally and unintentionally yeild different results. So, here as well, in the case of one who has his ideas of distinctions among accessories like ladle etc., actions and results eliminated by the knowledge of Brahman, even activites which are merely external movements amount to inaction. Hence it was said, 'gets totally destroyed.'
Here some say: That which is Brahman is the ladle etc. It is surely Brahman Itself which exists in the five forms [Asscessories that can be indicated by the five grammatical case-ending, viz Nominative, Objective, Instrumental, Dative and Locative. (As for instance, the sacrificer, oblation, ladle, sacrificial fire, and Brahman.-Tr.) of accessories such as the ladle etc. and it is Itself which undertakes actions. There the ideas of ladle etc. are not eradicated, but the idea of Brahman is attributed to the ladle etc. as one does the ideas of Visnu etc. to images etc., or as one does the idea of Brahman ot name etc.
Reply: True, this could have been so as well if the context were not meant for the praise of jnanayajna (Knowledge considered as a sacrifice). Here, however, after presenting full realization as expressed by the word jnana-yajna, and the varieties of rites as referred to by the word yajna (sacrifice), Knowledge has been praised by the Lord in, 'Jnana-yajna (Knowledge considered as a sacrifice) is greater than sacrifices reiring materials' (33). And in the present context, this statement, 'the ladle is Brahman' etc., is capable of presenting Knowledge as a sacrifice; otherwise, since Brahman is everything, it will be purposeless to speak specially only of ladle etc. as Brahman. But those who maintain that one has to superimpose the idea of Brahman on the ladle etc., like superimposing the idea of Visnu and others on images etc. and of Brahman on name etc., for them the knowledge of Brahma stated (in the verse) cannot be the intended subject-matter dealt with here, because according to them ladle etc. are the (primary) objects of knowledge (in the context of the present verse).
Besides, knowledge in the form of superimposition of an idea cannot lead to Liberation as its result; and what is said here is, 'Brahman alone in to be realized by him'. Also, it is inconsistent to maintain that the result of Liberation can be achieved without full realization. And it goes against the context-the context being of full realization. This is supported by the fact that (the subject of ) full realization is introduced in the verse, 'He who finds inaction in action,' and at the end (of this chapter) the conclusion pertains to that very subject-matter. The chapter comes to a close by eulozing full realization itself in, 'Jnana-yajna (Knowledge considered as a sacrifice) is greater than sacrifices reiring materials', 'Achieving Knowledge, one৷৷.attains supreme Peace,' (39) etc. That being so, it is unjustifiable to suddenly say out of context that one has to superimpose the idea of Brahman on the ladle etc. like the superimposition of the idea of Visnu on images. Therefore this verse bears the meaing just as it has been already explained.
As to that, after having presented Knowledge as a sacrifice, other sacrifices also are being mentioned now in, the verses beginning with, '(Other yogis undertake) sacrifice to gods alone,' etc., for eulogizing that Knowledge:
4.25 Some Yogies perform sacrifice to the gods alone; while others (who have realised the Self) offer the self as sacrifice by the Self in the fire of Brahman alone.
4.25 Some sages sacrifice to the Powers; others offer themselves on the alter of the Eternal.
4.25. Certain other men of Yoga are completely devoted to yajna, connected with the devas and offer that yajna, simply as a yajna, into the insatiable fire of the Brahman.
4.25 Some Yogins resort only to the sacrifice relating to gods. Others offer sacrifice into the fire of Brahman solely by means of sacrifice.
4.25 Other yogis undertake sacrifice to gods alone, Others offer the Self, as a sacrifice by the Self itself, in the fire of Brahman.
4.25 Some Karma Yogins resort to the sacrifice relating to gods, i.e., the sacrifice which takes the form of worshipping gods. The meaning is that they have steadfast devotion only in this. 'Others offer sacrifice into the fire of Brahman solely by means of sacrifice.' Here the term, 'sacrifice' is used in the sense of the oblation, the ladle etc., reired for performing a sacrifice and therefore they are said to constitute 'sacrificing.' These are of the nature of Brahman. 'Offer by means of sacrifice' indicates the ladle and other implements for the accomplishment of sacrifice.
4.25 Daivam etc.  the Devas are the sense-organs that are playful.  The yajna that stands based  on them is nothing but the act of receiving objects of their own.  Certain persons are thoroughly devoted only to that yajna, i.e.,  they gain the gain of their own Self by examining this (yajna)  from its root .  That is why they are men of Yoga;  for, they are absorbed  in the Yoga  permanently at all stages.  Indeed in Yogin  the suffix  ini,  a synonym of matup, here signifies  'perpetual connection'.  Further,  they (Yogins) pour,  as an offering,  the self-same  yajna,  above defined, into the Brhaman-fire that is insatiable i.e. that cannot be satisfied.  Thus  [the verse] has been interpreted by some.
 
However,  the Sage  (the author of the Gita)  does not violate the context.   Hence,  that meaning which exists in his heart we shall show :  Certain  masters of  Yoga  perform godly sacrifice i.e.,  sacrifice, consisting of external objects,  and intending only deities like Indra etc., of varied forms.  Further, with a single conviction that  'It is a Yajna and a thing to be performed',  i.e., with no craving for fruit, they offer the same sacrifice, that  is being  performed, into the  Brahman - fire which is insatiable i.e.,  difficult to satisfy.  Thus even those,  who perform  sacrificial rites with material objects, attain the Supreme Brahman.  For, it is going to be declared in the seel :  'All these persons too have understood sacrifice'  (IV, 30 below).  The Vedic text also [says] :
 
      'The gods offered sacrifice  [just] as sacrifice'.  (RV, I, 164, 50; TS, III, v, II, 5; etc.)
4.25 Apare, other; yoginah, yogis, ritualists; pari-upasate, undertake; yajnam, sacrifice; daivam, to gods; eva, alone. A sacrifice by which the gods are adored is daiva-yajna; they perform only that. This is the meaning.
Brahma-agnau, in the fire of Brahman: By the word brahman is meant That which is referred to in such sentences as, 'Brahman is Truth, knowledge and infinite' (Tai. 2.1), 'Knowledge, Bliss, Brahman' (Br. 3.9.28), 'the Brahman that is immediate and direct-the self that is within all' (Br.3.4.1), which is devoid of all worldly characteristiscs like hunger etc. and which is beyond all particular alifications-as stated in, 'Not this, not this' (Br.4.4.22). That which is Brahman is the fire. [Brahman is called fire because, as reflected in wisdom, It burns away everything, i.e. ignorance, or because everything merges into It during dissolution (pralaya).] And it is spoken of as Brahmagni with a view to referring to It as that into which the offering is made.
In that fire of Brahman, apare, others, other knowers of Brahman; upa-juhvati, offer; yajnam, the Self, which is referred to by the word yajna (sacrifice), it, having, been presented as a synonym of the Self;-that Self, which is a sacrifice, which is reality is verily the supreme Brahman, which is associated with such limiting adjuncts as the intellect etc., which is associated with all the alities of the limiting adjuncts superimposed on it, and which is the oblation, (they offer) yajnena, by the Self itself as described above. The offering (of the Self) in that (Brahman) is nothing but the realization of that Self which is assoicated with the limiting adjuncts to be the supreme Brahman which is free from adjuncts. The monks, steadfast in the realization of the identity of Brahman and the Self, make that offering. This is the meaning.
Beginning with, 'The ladle is Brahman' etc., this sacrifice characterized as full realization is being included among such sacrifices as daiva-yajna etc. with a view to eulogizing it in the verses beginning with, 'O destroyer of enemies, jnana-yajna is greater than the sacrifices involving (sacrificial) materials'.
4.26 Some again offer the organ of hearing and other senses as sacrifice in the fire of restraint; others offer sound and other objects of the senses as sacrifice in the fire of the senses.
4.26 Some sacrifice their physical senses in the fire of self-control; others offer up their contact with external objects in the sacrificial fire of their senses.
4.26. [Yet] others offer the sense-organs like sense-of-hearing and the rest into the fiires of [their] restrainer; others offer the objects like sound and the rest into the fires of the sense-organs.
4.26 Others offer as oblations hearing and other senses in  the fires of restraint. Some others offer as oblations the objects of the senses, such as sound and the rest, into the fires of their senses.
4.26 Others offer the organs, viz ear etc., in the fires of self-control. Others offer the objects, viz sound etc., in the fires of the organs.
4.26 Others endeavour towards the restraint of the senses like ear and the rest, i.e., keep themselves away from the objects pleasing to the senses. Other Yogins endeavour to prevent the attachment of the senses to sound and other objects of the senses, i.e., they abstain from the sense objects even when they are allowed to be near, by the discriminative process of belittling their valure and enjoyable nature.
4.26 Srotradini etc.  But others [offer] the sense-organs into the fires of the restrainer.  Restrainer :  the mind.  Its fires are the tongues of flame that are in the form of  subdued views of objects and are capable of burning  up desires.  Into them they offer the sense-organs.  Hence, they are the performers of penance-sacrifices.  Still others offer objects into  the fires of sense-organs that are  fully set-blaze by wisdom and that are  capable of burning up the fruits  [of actions].  I.e.,  they seek enjoyment only for destroying the [past]  mental impression of differences  [between the enjoyer and the objects of enjoyment].  This is the secret and sacred truth. Hence I  (Ag.)  have myself  stated in the laghvi  Prakriya  (the Little Process)  as :
 
'The object of enjoyment does not manifest as different  from you, the enjoyer.  Because, it is the [process of]  enjoyment that itself  is the identification (or unity) of hte enjoyer and the object of enjoyment'.
 
In the [work]  Spanda also  [it has been said] :
 
'It is the enjoyer himself who remains in all the instances and at all times,  in the form of the object of enjoyment'.
4.26 Anye, others, other yogis; juhvati, offer; indriyani, the organs; viz srotradini, car etc.; samyama-agnisu, in the fires of self-control. The plural (in fires) is used because self-control is possible in respect of each of the organs. Self-control itself is the fire. In that they make the offering, i.e. they practise control of the organs. anye, others; juhvati, offer; visayan, the objects; sabdadin, viz sound etc.; indriyagnisu, in the fires of the organs. The organs themselves are the fires. They make offerings in those fires with the organs of hearing etc. They consider the perception of objects not prohibited by the scriputures to be a sacrifice.
4.27 Others again sacrifice all the functions of the senses and those of the breath (vital energy or Prana) in the fire of the Yoga of self-restraint kindled by knowledge.
4.27 Other again sacrifice their activities and their vitality in the Spiritual fire of self-abnegation, kindled by wisdom.
4.27. Some others offer all actions of their sense-organs and the actions of their life-breath into the fire of Yoga of the self control, set ablaze by wisdom.
4.27 Some again offer as oblation the functions of the senses and the activity of the vital breaths into the fire of the Yoga of restraint of the mind kindled by knowledge.
4.27 Others offer all the activities of the organs and the activities of the vital force into the fire of the yoga of sel-control which has been lighted by Knowledge.
4.27 Some again offer as oblations all the functions of the senses, the activities of the vital breath etc., into the fire of Yoga of restraint of the mind kindled by knowledge. They endeavour to prevent the mind from getting attached to the functions of the senses and vital breaths. That is, by contemplating on the self they sublimate these energies and overcome even the lurking subtle desires for them.
4.27 See Comment under 4.28
4.27 Further, apare, others; juhvati, offer, i.e. merge; sarvani, all; indriya-karmani, the activities of the organs; and also the prana-karmani, activities of the vital force- prana means the air in the body; they offer its activities such as contraction, expansion, etc; atma-samyama yoga-agnau, into the fire of the yoga of self-control-withdrawal (samyama) [Samyama consists of concentration, meditation, and Self-absorption. The idea conveyed by the verse is that by stopping all activities, they concentrate the mind on the Self.] into the Self (atma) is self-control (atma-samyama); that itself is the fire of yoga (yoga-agni); (they offer) into that fire; jnana-dipite, which has been lighted by Knowledge, made to blaze up by discriminating knowledge, as if lighted up by oil.
4.28 Others again offer wealth, austerity and Yoga as sacrifice, while the ascetics of self-restraint and rigid vows offer study of scriptures and knowledge as sacrifice.
4.28 And yet others offer as their sacrifice wealth, austerities and meditation. Monks wedded to their vows renounce their scriptural learning and even their spiritual powers.
4.28. [These] are [respectively] the performs of sacrifices with material objects, the performers of sacrifices with penance, and the performers of sacrifices with Yoga.  Likewise [there are] yet  other ascetics with rigid vows whose sacrifices are the svadhyaya-knowledge.
4.28 Self-controlled and firm of resolve, others perform the sacrifice of material objects or austerities or Yoga; while others offer their scriptural study and knowledge.
4.28 Similarly, others are performers of sacrifices through wealth, through austerity, through yoga, and through study and knowledge; others are ascetics with severe vows.
4.28 Some Karma Yogins perform the sacrifice of material objects. Some worship the gods with materials honestly acired. Some practise charity, some engage themselves in sacrifices and in making oblations into the sacred fire. All these perform sacrifice with material objects. Some do the sacrifice of austerity by devoting themselves to Krcchra, Candrayana, fast, etc. Others perform the sacrifice of Yoga. Some devote themselves to making pilgrimages to sacred sanctuaries and holy places. Here the term Yoga means pilgrimages to sacred sancturaries and holy places as the context relates to aspects of Karma Yoga. Some are devoted to recitation of Vedic texts and some to learning their meaning. They are all devoted to the practice of self-control and of strict vows, i.e., they are men to steady resolution.
4.27-28 Sarvani etc.  Dravyayajnak etc.  Again all the activities of their sense-organs,  the activities of their mind, and the activities of their vital airs,  such as issuing through the mouth  and nose,  driving down the urine etc., other  [seekers]  established  in the fire of concentration,  named  Yoga,  which is the means for subduing  the self i.e.,  the mind, and which is set ablaze by  i.e., to be filled  with, knowledge.  The idea is this :  With their intellect  that has completely abandoned  all other activities due to their  concentration on the object, they receive the object that is being perceived on conceived.  That has been stated in the  Sivopanisad :
 
'When the intellect,  concentrated on a certain object, not rejected, would not go to another object,  at that time the meditation, remaining in the core of the objects,  blossoms very much.'
 
Thus the Yoga-sacrifices are explained.
 So far the performers of the material-object-sacrifices, the austerity-sacrifices, and the yoga-sacrifices have been defined.  Those, who are the performers of the svadhyaya-knowledge-sacrifices are defined now [as] -
4.28 Tatha, similarly; apare, others; are dravya-yajnah, perfomers of sacrifices through wealth-those sacrificers who spend wealth (dravya) in holy places under the idea of performing sacrifices; tapo-yajnah, performers of sacrifices through austerity, men of austerity, to whom austerity is a sacrifice; [This is according to Ast.-Tr.] yogayajnah, performers of sacrifice through yoga-those to whom the yoga consisting in the control of the vital forces, withdrawal of the organs, etc., is a sacrifice; and svadhyaya-jnana-yajnah, performers of sacrifices through study and knowledge.
Sacrificers through study are those to whom the study of Rg-veda etc. accroding to rules is a sacrifice. And sacrificers through knowledge are those to whom proper understanding of the meaing of the scriptures is a sacrifice. Others are yatayah, ascetics, who are deligent; samsita-vratah, in following severe vows. Those whose vows (vratah) have been fully sharpened (samsita), made very rigid, are samsita-vratah. [Six kinds of sacrifices have been enumerated in this verse.]
Further,
4.29 Others offer as sacrifice the outgoing breath in the incoming, and the incoming in the outgoing, restraining the course of the outgoing and the incoming breaths, solely absorbed in the restraint of the breath.
4.29 There are some who practise control of the Vital Energy and govern the subtle forces of Prana and Apana, thereby sacrificing their Prana unto Apana, or their Apana unto Prana.
4.29. - 4.30. [Some sages] offer the prana into the apana; like-wise others offer the apana into the prana.  Having controlled both the courses of the prana and apana, the same sages, with their desire fulfilled by the above activities, and with their food restricted, offer the pranas into pranas.  All these persons know what sacrifices are and have their sins destroyed by sacrifices.
4.29 Others, with restricted diet, are devoted to the control of breath. Some sacrifice the inward breath in the outward breath. Similarly others sacrifice the outward breath in the inward breath. Some others, stopping the flow of both the inward breath and the outward, sacrifice the inward breaths and outward breaths.
4.29 Constantly practising control of the vital forces by stopping the movements of the outgoing and the incoming breaths, some offer as a sacrifice the outgoing breath in the incoming breath; while still others, the incoming breath in the outgoing breath.
4.29 - 4.30 Other Karma Yogins are devoted to the practice of breath control. They are of three types because of the differences in inhalation, exhalation and stoppage of breath. Puraka (inhalation) is that in which the inward breath is sacrificed in the outward breath. Recaka (exhalation) is that when the outward breath is sacrificed in the inward breath. Kumbhaka (stoppage of breath) is that when the flow of both inward and outward breaths is stopped. The clause, restricting of diet, applies to all the three types of persons devoted to the control of breath.

All these, according to their liking and capacity are engaged in performing the various kinds of Karma Yoga beginning from the sacrifice of material objects to the control of breath. They know and are devoted to sacrifices comprising obligatory and occasional rituals preceded by the performance of 'the great sacrifices' (Panca-Maha-Yajna), as alluded to in 'Creating men along with the sacrifices' (3.10). Because of this only, their sins are done away with. Those who are engaged in Karma Yoga by sustaining their bodies only by the ambrosia of sacrificial remains will go to the eternal Brahman. 'Go to Brahman' here means realise the self which has Brahman for Its soul.
4.29 See Comment under 4.30
4.29 Pranayama-parayanah, constantly practising control of the vital forces-i.e. they practise a form of pranayama called Kumbhaka (stopping the breath either inside or outside) ['Three sorts of motion of Pranayama (control of the vital forces) are, one by which we draw the breath in, another by which we throw it out, and the third action is when the breath is held in the lungs or stopped from entering the lungs.'-C.W., Vol.I, 1962, p. 267. 
Thus, there are two kinds of Kumbhaka-internal and external.]-; prana-apana-gati ruddhva, by stopping the movements of the outgoing and the incoming breaths-the outgoing of breath (exhalation) through the mouth and the nostrils is the movement of the Prana; as opposed to that, the movement of Apana is the going down (of breath) (inhalation); these constitute the prana-apana-gati, movements of Prana and Apana; by stopping these; some juhvati, offer as a sacrifice; pranam, the outgoing breath, which is the function of Prana; apane, in the incoming breath, which is the function of Apana-i.e. they practised a form of pranayama called Puraka ('filling in'); while tatha apare, still others; offer apanam, the incoming breath; prane, in the outgoing breath, i.e. they practise a form of pranayama called Recaka ('emptying out'). [Constantly practising control of the vital, forces, they perform Kumbhaka after Recaka and Puraka.]
4.3 That same ancient Yoga has been today taught to thee by Me, for thou art My devotee and My friend; it is the supreme secret.
4.3 It is the same ancient Path that I have now revealed to thee, since thou are My devotee and My friend. It is the supreme Secret.
4.3. The self-same ancient Yoga has been taught now by Me to you on the ground that you are My devotee and friend too.  This is the highest secret.
4.3 It is the same ancient Yoga which is now taught to you by Me, as you are My devotee and My friend. For, this is a supreme mystery.
4.3 That ancient Yoga itself, which is this, has been taught to you by Me today, considering that you are My devotee and friend, For, this (Yoga) is a profound secret.
4.3 It is the same ancient, unchanged Yoga which is now taught to you, who out of friendship and overwhelming devotion have resorted to Me whole-heartedly. The meaning is that it has been taught to you fully with all its accessories. Because it is the most mysterious knowledge declared in the Vedanta, it cannot be known or taught by anyone other than Myself.

In this connection, in order to know the truth about the Lord's descent correctly, Arjuna asked:
4.1-3 Evam etc.  upto  uttamam.  Eventhough it has come down by regular  succession of teacher,  it is lost now.  By this  [statement]  the Bhagavat indicates the rarity  (or difficulty)  and respectability of this  knowledge.  You are My devotee and friend too :  You are a devotee having nothing but Me as your final goal and you are a friend too.  This  'too'  indicates the secondary importance  [of the friendship].  Hence, just as in the sentence  'wander  begging food  [etc]',  the importance  lies in the act of begging food,  but unimportance  in the act of bringing the cow;  in the same way, in the present case it is devotion  towards the  teacher that is important  and not the friendship also.  This is the idea intended here.
4.3 Sah, that; puratanah, ancient; yogah, Yoga; eva, itself; ayam, which is this; proktah, has been taught; te, to you; maya, by Me; adya, today; iti, considering that; asi, you are; me, My; bhaktah, devotee; ca sakha, and friend. Hi, for; etat, this Yoga, i.e. Knowledge; is a uttamam, profound; rahasyam, secret.
Lest someone should understand that the Lord has said something contradictory, therefore, in order to prevent that (doubt), as though raising a estion,
4.30 Others who regulate their diet offer life-breaths in life-breaths. All these are knowers of sacrifice, whose sins are destroyed by sacrifice.
4.30 Others, controlling their diet, sacrifice their worldly life to the spiritual fire. All understand the principal of sacrifice, and by its means their sins are washed away.
4.29. - 4.30. [Some sages] offer the prana into the apana; like-wise others offer the apana into the prana.  Having controlled both the courses of the prana and apana, the same sages, with their desire fulfilled by the above activities, and with their food restricted, offer the pranas into pranas.  All these persons know what sacrifices are and have their sins destroyed by sacrifices.
4.30 All these know the meaning of sacrifices and through sacrifices are their sins eradicated. Those who subsist on the ambrosial food, the remnants of sacrifices, go to eternal Brahman.
4.30 Others, having their food regulated, offer the vital forces in the vital forces. All of them are knowers of the sacrifice and have their sins destroyed by sacrifice.
4.29 - 4.30 Other Karma Yogins are devoted to the practice of breath control. They are of three types because of the differences in inhalation, exhalation and stoppage of breath. Puraka (inhalation) is that in which the inward breath is sacrificed in the outward breath. Recaka (exhalation) is that when the outward breath is sacrificed in the inward breath. Kumbhaka (stoppage of breath) is that when the flow of both inward and outward breaths is stopped. The clause, restricting of diet, applies to all the three types of persons devoted to the control of breath.

All these, according to their liking and capacity are engaged in performing the various kinds of Karma Yoga beginning from the sacrifice of material objects to the control of breath. They know and are devoted to sacrifices comprising obligatory and occasional rituals preceded by the performance of 'the great sacrifices' (Panca-Maha-Yajna), as alluded to in 'Creating men along with the sacrifices' (3.10). Because of this only, their sins are done away with. Those who are engaged in Karma Yoga by sustaining their bodies only by the ambrosia of sacrificial remains will go to the eternal Brahman. 'Go to Brahman' here means realise the self which has Brahman for Its soul.
4.29-30 Apane etc.  Apare etc.  Prana  (1st)  :  the arising  one i.e.,  the nada which has, as its end, that one where the first syllabic instance of  Pranava  dissolves.   Into the apana : into  what sets down,  and is of the nature of entering  inot the Svananda.  They offer :  Thus is the svadhyaya of the nature of the firmness of the body is described.
 
What sets down, some  [sages]  established on what rises up,  so that the pupil's  self  (mind)  may learn the processes of sending out and drawing  in [the vital airs].  By [thus]  uniting  these two, they bestow emanciaption on their own Self  and on the Self of the pupils;  and they,  on that account, remain with their mind firmly established on the svadhyaya-sacrifice full of Svananda  (i.e.,  Nijananda) and Parananda - a svadhyaya of the nature of examining,  enlightening, entering and uniting  [the prana nad apana]  in their own Self  and in the Self  of the pupils.  That is why the process of filling  [the vital air] in has been first  mentioned;  and the process of  emptying the same out at the last.  Further, the process of the inward turning of the act of enjoying objects, is  suggested by the first  arter of the verse (29),  and by the second  arter the act of coming  out for enjoying  the objects through the process of having the supreme state-of-bodylessness.  Therefore,  the performers of the sacrifice of wisdom are not different  from the performers of the svadhyaya-sacrifice.
 
The same sages have the desries of  their  own and of their pupils fulfilled  on  account  of their  thorough practice of the said  activity;  control both the said  paths, restrict their food viz.,  enjoyment of objects;  and offer pranas  into the pranas, i.e,  they offer, by means of the ietude at the stage  of stopping  [the vital air],  the rising  of all the mental modifications into the splendour of rising waves  of  Parananda and  Nirananda.  All these persons  know the truth (or nature) of hte sacrifices, starting from the material-sacrifice upto the wisdom-sacrifice;  only by that means they have eradicated their sins; that is to say,  they have uprooted the mighty delusion with its roots,  made of mental  impressions of duality.
4.30 Besides, apare, others; niyata-aharah, having their food regulated; juhvati, offer; pranan, the vital forces, the different kinds of vital forces; pranesu, in the vital forces themselves. Whichever function of the vital forces is brought under control, in it they offer the other functions. These latter become, as it were, merged in the former. Sarve api, all; of ete, them; yajna-vidah, are knowers of the sacrifice; and yajna-ksapita-kamasah, have their sins destroyed by the sacrifices as mentioned above.
After accomplishing the above-mentioned sacrifices,
4.31 Those who eat the remnants of the sacrifice, which are like nectar, go to the eternal Brahman. This world is not for the man who does not perform sacrifice; how then can he have the other, O Arjuna?
4.31 Tasting the nectar of immortality, as the reward of sacrifice, they reach the Eternal. This world is not for those who refuse to sacrifice; much less the other world.
4.31. The eaters of the sacrifice-ordained (or sacrificial remnant) nectar, attain the eternal Brahman.  [Even] this world is not for a non-sacrificer, how can there be the other ?  O best of the Kurus !
4.31 This world is not for him who makes no sacrifice. How then the other, O Arjuna?
4.31 Those who partake of the nectar left over after a sacrifice, reach the eternal Brahman. This world ceases to exist for one who does not perform sacrifices. What to speak of the other (world), O best among the Kurus (Arjuna)!
4.31 He 'who offers no sacrifices,' i.e., he who does not devote himself to obligatory and occasional actions, preceded by the performance of the 'great sacrifices' etc., will not be able to achieve human ends which are associated with the material world and are called by the names of virtue, wealth and worldly satisfactions. How then can the man's supreme end called release (Moksa), which is other than these, be attained?  As Moksa, man's supreme end, has been mentioned, other objectives different from it, are named 'this world.' That is, indeed, the material world.

[Perhaps the idea is that all types of sacrificers should perform the Panca-Maha-Yajnas, and take the remnants of it as their daily food. Only in this way can we give some meaning to 'ambrosial food' connected with the performance of all the various kinds of sacrifice mentioned in the above verses.]
4.31 Yajna-etc.  They enjoy the nectar of the Parananda and the Nirananda,  which is of the nature of relaxing  in their  own Self and which has been ordained-i.e., brought about - by the sacrifice and which is the remnant of the sacrifice in the form of satisfying  [the deities of]  their own  sense-organs. Yet,  remaining as Brahman Itself, they get  themselves mixed  [in this mundane life] to their heart-content.
 
Here we refrain [ourselves] from the free talk of clearly disclosing  what is highly secret.  Further, here a good amount of tasty secret  has been kept well hidden.  Yet, this becomes an object of [actual]  chewing and  [thus] becomes  the cause for enjoying (realising)  what is Real, in the case of those persons whose  [bodily and internal]  elements have been ealised by the powerful medicines of the tradition learnt from the revered teachers, pleased with service, laden with very assiduous devotion.
 
In this context other explanations have been offered by  [other]  commentators. However, let the intellectuals  weigh and decide for themselves, those  explanations and the etymological interpretations offered by our revered preceptors.  So, look !  What is the use of the sport of criticising the statements of those commentators ?  Hence let us stick to only what we have begun with.
4.31 Yajna-sista-amrta-bhujah, those who partake of the nectar left over after a sacrifice, i.e. those who, after performing the sacrifices described above, eat, during the leisure after the sacrifice, the food called nectar, as prescribed by the injunctions; yanti, reach; sanatanam brahma, the eternal Brahman. For the sake of consistency (with the Upanisads) it is understood that if they (the sacrificers) are seekers of liberation, (then they reach Brahman) in due course of time. [The Upanisads describe the different stages through which those who do good deeds and practise meditation have to pass before reaching the alified Brahman after death. For liberation there is need also of purification of the heart, Thus, they reach Brahman by stages, and not immediately after death. (See Ch. 8.5 and subseent portion; also, Br. 4.3.35 to 4.4.25, etc.)]
Even ayam lokah, this world, common to all beings; na asti, ceases to exist; ayajnasya, for one who does not perform sacrifices, for him who does not have to his credit even a single one of the above sacrifices. Kutah anyah, what to speak of the other world which can be achieved through special disciplines; kurusattama, O best among the Kurus!
4.32 Thus, manifold sacrifices are spread out before Brahman (literally) at the mouth or face of Brahman). Know them all as born of action and thus knowing, thou shalt be liberated.
4.32 In this way other sacrifices too may be undergone for the Spirit's sake. Know thou that they all depend on action. Knowing this, thou shalt be free.
4.32. Thus, sacrifices of many varieties have been elaborated in the mouth of the Brahman.  Know them all as having sprung from actions. By knowing thus you shall be liberated.
4.32 Thus many forms of sacrifices have been spread out as means of reaching Brahman (individual self in its own nature). Know that all these born of actions. Knowing thus, you shall be free.
4.32 Thus, various kinds of sacrifices lie spread at the mouth of the Vedas. Know them all to be born of action. Knowing thus, you will become liberated.
4.32 Thus there are many kinds of Kamra Yoga, which are spread out for the attainment of the Brahman. That means, they lead to the realisaion of the true nature of the individual self. Know that all these are forms of Karma Yoga, which have been previoulsy defined and diversified, as born of actions. That means, know them as resulting from occasional and obligatory rites performed day by day. Knowing thus, observing them in the manner prescribed, you will be released.

It has been stated that actions have the form of knowledge because of the inclusion of knowledge in them. Now Sri Krsna explains the predominance of the component of knowledge in such actions which include knowledge within themselves.
4.32 Evam etc.  All these sacrifices have been detailed in the mouth of i.e.,  at the entrance to, i.e., as means to [attain], the Brahman.  In them there lies the practice of actions as common factor.  By knowing in this manner,  you too shall attain liberation  from bondage.				
 The speciality here is this :
4.32 Evam, thus; bahu-vidha yajnah, various kinds of sacrifices as described; vitatah, lie spread; mukhe, at the mouth, at the door; brahmanah, of the Vedas. Those which are known through the Vedas- as for instance, 'We offer the vital force into speech', etc.-are said to be vitatah, spread, elaborated; mukhe, at the mouth; brahmanah, of the Vedas.
Viddhi, know; tan, them; sarvan, all; to be karmajan, born of action, accoplished through the activities of body, speech and mind, but not born of the Self. For the Self is actionless. Hence, jnatva, knowing; evam, thus; vimoksyase, you will become liberated from evil. By knowing thus- 'These are not my actions; I am actionless and detached'-You will be freed from worldly bondage as a result of this full enlightenment. This is the purport.
Through the verse beginning with, 'The ladle is Brahman' etc., complete Illumination has been represented as a sacrifice. And sacrifices of various kinds have been taught. With the help of [Some translate this as: As compared with৷৷.-Tr.] those (sacrifices) that are meant for accomplishing desireable human ends, Knowledge (considered as a sacrifice) is being extolled:
How?
4.34 Know That by long prostration, by estion and by service; the wise who have realised the Truth will instruct thee in (that) knowledge.
4.34 This shalt thou learn by prostrating thyself at the Master's feet, by questioning Him and by serving Him. The wise who have realised the Truth will teach thee wisdom.
4.34. This you should learn  [from those, endowed with knowledge],  by prostration, by iniry and by service [all offered to them]; those who are endowed with knowledge and are capable of showing the truth will give you the truth nearby;
4.34 Know this by prostration, estioning and by service. The wise, who have realised the truth, will instruct you in knowledge.
4.34 Know that through prostration, iniry and service. The wise ones who have realized the Truth will impart the Knowledge to you.
4.34 This is the knowledge concerning the self that has been taught by Me in the verses beginning with 'Know that to be indestructibe' (2.17) and ending with 'this has been given to you' (2.39). So engaged in appropriate actions, you can learn, according to the maturity of your competence, this wisdom from the wise, who will explain it to you, if you attend on them through prostrating and estioning and by serving them. The wise are those who have immediate apprehension (or vision) of the true nature of the self. Having been honoured by you through prostration etc., and observing your mental disposition characterised by desire for knowledge which you have evinced by your estions, they will teach you this knowledge.

Sri Krsna now speaks of the characterisitcs of knowledge concerning the nature of the self, in the form of direct perception.
4.34 See Comment under 4.35
4.34 Viddhi, know; tat, that, the process by which It is acired; by approaching teachers pranipatena, through prostration, by lying fully streched on the ground with face downward, with prolonged salutation; pariprasnena, through iniry, as to how bondage and Liberation come, and what are Knowledge and ignorance; and sevaya, through the service of the guru. (Know it) through these and other (disciplines) [Other disciplines such as control of the mind, body, etc. Sankaracarya's own words in the Commentary are evamadina, after which Ast. puts a full stop, and agreeing with this, A.G. says that the word viddhi (know) is to be connected with evamadina. Hence this translation. Alternatively, those words have to be taken with prasrayena. Then the meaning will be, 'Being pleased with such and other forms of humility৷৷.'-Tr.]. Being pleased with humility, jnaninah, the wise ones, the teachers; tattva-darsinah, who have realized the Truth; upadeksyanti, will impart, will tell; te, you; jnanam, the Knowledge as described above.
Although people may be wise, some of them are apt to know Truth just as it is, while others may not be so. Hence the alification, 'who have realized the Truth'. The considered view of the Lord is that Knowledge imparted by those who have full enlightenment becomes effective, not any other.
That being so, the next verse also becomes appropriate:
4.35 Knowing ï1thatï1 thou shalt not, O Arjuna, again get deluded like this; and by that thou shalt see all beings in thy Self and also in Me.
4.35 Having known That, thou shalt never again be confounded; and, O Arjuna, by the power of that wisdom, thou shalt see all these people as if they were thine own Self, and therefore as Me.
4.35. By knowing which you shall not get deluded once again in this manner, O son of Pandu; and by which means you shall see all beings without exception in [your] Self i.e., in Me.
4.35 Knowing which, O Arjuna, you will not fall again into delusion in this way - by that knowledge you will see all beings without exception in your-self and then in Me.
4.35 Knowing which, O Pandava (Arjuna), you will not come under delusion again in this way, and through which you will see all beings without exception in the Self and also in Me.
4.35 Having which knowledge, you will not again fall into this delusion of mistaking the body etc., for the self, which is the cause of possessiveness etc. By this (knowledge) you will see in yourself all the beings which appear in diversity of forms such as gods, men etc.; for between you and other beings there is eality of nature when freed from the hold of Prakrti, as your self and all other selves have the form of knowledge as fas as their essence is concerned. Sri Krsna will later on instruct that the nature of the self, dissociated from the evil of contact with Prakrti, is eal in all beings. 'For faultless Brahman (individual self) is alike everywhere; therefore, abide in Brahman' (5.19). And then you will see all beings without any exception in Me, because of the similarity of nature of the pure selves with one another and with My nature. For Sri Krsna will teach later on:

'Resorting to this knowledge and partaking of My nature' (14.5). So the euality of the selves, devoid of name and form, with the nature of the Supreme, is known from the texts like:  'Then the wise, shaking off good and evil, stainless, attain supreme eality' (Mun. U., 3.1.3). Therefore all selves dissociated from Prakrti are eal in nature to one another and eal in nature to the Lord of all. [The idea is that blissfulness is the basic nature of all selves. Blissfulness (Ananda) is the nature of the Supreme Being also. Eality contemplated is in this respect only, but not in power of creation, which belongs only to Isvara]
4.34-35 Tat etc.  Yaj=jnatva etc.  This :  the knowledge. By prostration :  by devotion. By iniry :  by  the consideration of pros and cons,  by good reasoning etc.  By service :  by practice.  You should learn [this],  For, those that are endowed with  knowledge  i.e.,  your own different  sense-organs, that are exceedingly favoured by consciousness, will point out nearby i.e.,  will lead the truth to you if  you remain practising in the said manner.  For this,   it has been said  that  they (sense-organs) are capable of showing the truth  i.e.,  they  show nothing but the truth. That has been said :
 
'The Yoga alone is the teacher of Yoga  [practice]' 
 
and 
 
'On  [reaching] that  [seeded Yoga]  [there arises] an 
insight,  truth-bearing'  (YS,  I,  48).
 
If  'those that are endowed with knowledge'  is interpreted to mean 'other wise persons',  then it would amount to say that what the Bhagavat  Himself had taught is untruth.  Or, the purpose of saying in this manner may be to teach a conventional rule :  Other persons too should learn from the men of wisdom only by prostration etc.,  and not by any other means.
 
The [locatives] atmani  'in your Self'  and mayi  'in Me' are in the same-case-relationship,   and they mean  'in your Soul that has attained (realised Its)  identity with Me'. Atho is an expletive.  In order to established the  [total]  sameness  (identity) of the Absolute with the  [individual]  Self, a certain characteristic mark   [of the two],  is mentioned  [here].  If the non-sameness (non-identity)  [of these two]  is intended, then the meanings 'choice'  etc.,  [of atho]  have no relevance here.										
 Saying that  'the sin also  perishes'  in the first verse  [of following two],  in order to clarify the earlier statement  'all actions, leaving no bit,  [meet their end in knowledge' - verse 33  above];  indicating, by  'all actions' - in the second verse-that the suggested meaning of  'leaving no bit (verse 33)' is  'not even a bit of mental impression  [of actions] survives';  [the Lord]  explains-
4.35 Jnatva, knowing; yat, which-by aciring which Knowledge imparted by them; O Pandava, na vasyasi, you will not come under; moham, delusion; punah, again; evam, in this way, in the way you have come under delusion now. Besides, yena, through which Knowledge; draksyasi, you will see directly; bhutani, all beings; asesena, without exception, counting from Brahma down to a clump of grass; atmani, in the Self, in the innermost Self, thus-'These beings exist in me' ; and atha, also; see that these are mayi. in Me, in Vasudeva, the supreme Lord. The purport is, 'You will realize the identity of the individual Self and God, which is well known in the Upanisads.'
Moreover, the greatness of this Knowledge is:
4.36 Even if thou art the most sinful of all sinners, yet thou shalt verily cross all sins by the raft of knowledge.
4.36 Be thou the greatest of sinners, yet thou shalt cross over all sin by the ferryboat of wisdom.
4.36. Even if you are the highest sinner amongst all sinners, you shall cross over [the ocean of] all the sin just by the boat of knowledge.
4.36 Even if you be the most sinful of all sinners, you will cross over all sins by the boat of knowledge alone.
4.36 Even if you be the worst sinner among all sinners, still you will cross over all the wickedness with the raft of Knowledge alone.
4.36 Even though you be the most sinful of all sinners, you will completely cross over the sea of sins previoulsy accumulated, with the boat of knowledge concerning the self.
4.36 See Comment under 4.37
4.36 Api cet asi, even if you be; papa-krt-tamah, the worst sinner, extremely sinful; sarvhyah, among all; paphyah, the sinners (papa, lit. sin, means here sinner) ; still santarisyasi, you will cross over; sarvam, all; the vrjinam, wickedness, the ocean of wickedness, sin; [Ast. reads papa-samudram, (ocean of sin) in place of papam.-Tr.] jnana-plavena eva, with the raft of Knowledge alone, by using Knowledge alone as a float. Here [Here, in the scriptures imparting spiritual instructions.], righteousness (formal religious observance), too, is said to be an evil in the case of one aspiring for Liberation.
How Knowledge destroys sin is being told with the help of an illustration:
4.37 As the blazing fire reduces fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge reduce all actions to ashes.
4.37 As the kindled fire consumes the fuel, so, O Arjuna, in the flame of wisdom the embers of action are burnt to ashes.
4.37. Just as the fire, well inflamed, reduces the fuels to ashes, so also the fire of knowledge reduces all actions to ashes.
4.37 Just as burning fire turns fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge turn all Karma to ashes.
4.37 O Arjuna, as a blazing fire reduces pieces of wood to ashes, similarly the fire of Knowledge reduces all actions to ashes.
4.37 The fire of knowledge concerning the real nature of the self reduces to ashes the collection of endless Karmas accumulated from beginningless times, just as a well-kindled fire reduces to ashes a bundle of firewood.
4.36-37 Api cet etc.  Yatha etc. The idea is this :  One should exert is such a way so that the fire of  knowledge remains well fuelled with the  knot of  firmness of conviction born of practice.
4.37 O Arjuna, yatha, as; a samiddhah, blazing; agnih, fire, a well lighted fire; kurute, reduces; edhamsi, pieces of wood; bhasmasat, to ashes; tatha, similarly; jnanagnih, the fire of Knowledge-Knowledge itself being the fire; kurute, reduces; bhasmasat, to ashes; sarva-karmani, all actions, i.e. it renders them ineffective, for the fire of Knowledge itself cannot directly [Knowledge destroys ignorance, and thery the idea of agentship is eradicated. This in turn makes actions impossible.] burn actions to ashes, like pieces of wood. So, the idea implied is that full enlightenment is the cuase of making all actions impotent.
From the force the context [If the body were to die just with the dawn of Knowledge, imparting of Knowledge by enlightened persons would be impossible, and thus there would be no teacher to transmit Knowledge!] it follows that, since the result of actions owing to which the present body has been born has already become effective, therefore it gets eshausted only through experiencing it. Hence, Knowledge reduces to ashes only all those actions that were done (in this life) prior to the rise of Knowledge and that have not become effective, as also those performed along with (i.e. after the dawn of) Knowledge, and those that were done in the many past lives.
Since this is so, therefore,
4.38 Verily, there is no purifier in this world like knowledge. He who is perfected in Yoga finds it in the Self in time.
4.38 There is nothing in the world so purifying as wisdom; and he who is a perfect saint finds that at last in his own Self.
4.38. In this world there exists no purifier comparabel to knowledge.   One who becomes perfect in Yoga finds this, on his own accord, in his Self in course of time.
4.38 For there is no purifier here eal to knowledge; he that is perfected in Karma Yoga finds this (knowledge) of his own accord in himself in due time.
4.38 Indeed, there is nothing purifying here comparable to Knowledge. One who has become perfected after a (long) time through yoga, realizes That by himself in his own heart.
4.38 Nothing here in this world purifies like this knowledge; for the knowledge of the self destroys all evil. He who has reached perfection by practising Karma Yoga in its form of knowledge daily in the manner taught, in due time, of his own accord, attaints it, i.e., knowledge concerning his own self.

Sri Krsna expounds the same lucidly thus:
4.38 Na hi etc.  There exists no purifier similar to the knowledge.  The purity of other things  is due to the touch of  Consciousness and is not intrinsic.  This point is not elaborated here for fear of a  lengthy discussion.  This purifying nature of the knowledge, one would understand for himself on reaching the stage of being perfectly enlightened.
4.38 Hi, indeed; na vidyate, there is nothing; pavitram, purifying, sanctifying; iha, here; sadrsam, comparable; jnanena, to Knowledge. Yoga-samsiddhah, one who has become perfected, who as attained fitness through yoga-the seeker after Liberation who has become samsiddhah, purified, qualified; yogena, through the yoga of Karma and the yoga of concentration-; kalena, after a long time; vindati, realizes, i.e. attains; tat, That, Knowledge; verily svayam, by himself; atmani, in his own heart. That means by which Knowledge is invariably attained is being taught:
4.39 The man who is full of faith, who is devoted to it, and who has subdued the senses obtains (this) knowledge; and having obtained the knowledge he attains at once to the supreme peace.
4.39 He who is full of faith attains wisdom, and he too who can control his senses, having attained that wisdom, he shall ere long attain Supreme Peace.
4.39. He, who has faith, gains knowledge, if he is solely intending upon it and has his sense-organs well-controlled; having gained the knowledge, he attains, before long, the Peace Supreme.
4.39 He who has faith, who is intent on it, and who has mastered his senses, attains knowledge. Having attained knowledge, he goes soon to supreme peace.
4.39 The man who has faith, is diligent and has control over the organs, attains Knowledge. Achieving Knowledge, one soon attains supreme Peace.
4.39 After attaining knowledge through instruction in the manner described, he must have firm faith in it and the possibility of its development into ripe knowledge. He must be intent on it, i.e., his mind must be focussed thereupon. He must control his senses and keep them away from all their objects. Soon will he then reach the aforesaid state of maturity and obtain knowledge. Soon after attaining such kind of knowledge, he will reach supreme peace, i.e., he attains the supreme Nirvana (realisation of the self).
4.39 See Comment under 4.40
4.39 Sraddhavan, the man who has faith; labhate, attains; jnanam, Knowledge. Even when one has faith, he may be indolent. Therefore the Lord says, tatparah, who is diligent, steadfast in the service of the teacher, etc., which are the means of attaining Knowledge. Even when one has faith and is diligent, one may not have control over the organs. Hence the Lord says, samyata-indriyah, who has control over the organs-he whose organs (indriyani) have been withdrawn (samyata) from objects. He who is such, who is full of faith, diligent, and has control over the organs, does surely attain Knowledge. However, prostrations etc., which are external, are not invariably fruitful, for there is scope for dissimulation faith etc. But this is not so in the case of one possessing faith etc. Hence they are the unfailing means of acquiring Knowledge. What, again, will result from gaining Knowledge? This is being answered: Labdhva, achieving; jnanam, Knowledge; adhigacchati, one attains; acirena, soon indeed; param, supreme; santim, Peace, supreme detachment called Liberation. That Liberation soon follows from full Knowledge is a fact well ascertained from all the scriptures and reasoning. One should not entertain any doubt in this matter. For doubt is the most vicious thing. Why? The answer is being stated:
4.4 Arjuna said  Later on was Thy birth, and prior to it was the birth of Vivasvan (the Sun); how am I to understand that Thou taughtest this Yoga in the beginning?
4.4 Arjuna asked: My Lord! Viwaswana was born before Thee; how then canst Thou have revealed it to him?
4.4. Arjuna said  Your birth is later, [while] the birth of Vivasvat is earlier; how am then to understand that You had properly taught  [him this]  in the beginnig ?
4.4 Arjuna said  Later was your birth, and earlier the birth of Vivasvan. How then am I to understand that you taught it in the beginning?
4.4 Arjuna said  Your birth was later, (whereas) the birth of Vivasvan was earlier. How am I to understand this that You instructed (him) in the beginning?
4.4 Arjuna said  According to the calculation of time, your birth was indeed later, contemporaneous with our births. And the birth of Vivasvan was at an earlier time, reckoned as twenty-eight cycles of units of four Yugas each. How can I understand as true that you taught it in the beginning?

Now, there is no contradiction here, for it was ite possible that He had taught Vivasvan in a former birth. The memory of what was done in former births is ite natural for great men. This should not be taken to mean that Arjuna does not know the son of Vasudeva, the speaker, as the Lord of all. Because he (Arjuna) says later on:  'You are the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Light and the Supreme Purifier. All the seers proclaim You as the eternal Divine Purusa, the Primal Lord, unborn and all-pervading. So also proclaim the divine sage Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa. You Yourself also are saying this to me' (10.12-13.)

Arjuna had heard repeatedly from Bhisma and others during the Rajasuya sacrifice of Yudhisthira, 'Krsna alone is the cause of creation and submergence of all the worlds. This universe, consisting of things both animate and inanimate, was created for the sake of Krsna' (Ma. Bha., 2.38.23) 'The entire universe is subservient to Krsna' is the meaning of 'For the sake of Krnsa'.

This apparent contradiction may be explained as follows:  Arjuna surely knows the son of Vasudeva as the Bhagavan. Though knowing Him as such, he estions as if he did not know Him. This is his intention. Can the birth of the Lord of all, who is antagonistic to all that is evil and wholly auspicious, omniscient, whose will is always true and whose desires are fulfilled - can the birth of such a Person be of the same nature as that of the gods, men etc., who are subject to Karma?  Or can it be false like the illusions of a magical show?  Or could it be real?  In other words, is the birth of the Supreme Being as the incarnate a real fact or a mere illusory phenomenon produced by a magician's art?  If His birth is real, what is the mode of His birth?  What is the nature of His body?  What is the manner of His birth?  What is the nature of this body of His?  What is the casue of His birth?  To what end is He born?  The way in which Sri Krsna answers Arjuna's estion, justifies the construing of his estion in this way.
4.4 Even though he knows the nature of the Lord,  Arjuna asks this estion in order to publisize  it  to the world.
4.4 Bhavatah, Your; janma, was aparam, later, in the abode of Vasudeva; (whereas) the birth vivasvatah, of Visvasvan, the Sun; was param, earlier, in the beginning of creation. Therefore, katham, how; vijanyam, am I to understand; etat, this, as not inconsistent; iti, that; tvam, You, yourself; who proktavan, insturcted this Yoga; adau, in the beginning, are the same person who are now teaching me?
By way of demolishing the doubt of fools with regard to Vasudeva, that He has no God-hood and omniscience-to which very purpose was Arjuna's estion-
4.40 The ignorant the faithless, the doubting self goes to destruction; there is neither this world nor the other, nor happiness for the doubting.
4.40 But the ignorant man, and he who has no faith, and the sceptic are lost. Neither in this world nor elsewhere is there any happiness in store for him who always doubts.
4.40. But he, who is ignorant and has no faith, perishes, with his self (mind) full of doubts.  Neither this world nor the other, nor happiness is for a person, who is by nature is full of doubts.
4.40 The ignorant, the faithless and the doubting one peirsh; for the doubting one there is neither this world, nor that beyond, nor happiness.
4.40 One who is ignorant and faithless, and has a doubting mind perishes. Neither this world nor the next nor happiness exists for one who has a doubting mind.
4.40 'The ignorant,' i.e., one devoid of knowledge received through instruction, 'the faithless' or one who has no faith in developing this knowledge taught to him, i.e., who does not strive to progress ickly, and 'the doubting one,' i.e., one who is full of doubts in regard to the knowledge taught - such persons perish, are lost. When this knowledge taught to him about the real nature of the self is doubted, then he loses this material world as also the next world. The meaning is that the ends of man, such as Dharma, Artha and Karma which constitute the material ends or fulfilments, are not achieved by such a doubting one. How then can man's supreme end, release be achieved by such a doubting one?  For all the ends of human life can be achieved through the actions which are prescribed by the Sastras, but their performance reires the firm conviction that the self is different from the body. Therefore, even a little happiness does not come to the person who has a doubting mind concerning the self.
4.39-40 Sraddhavan etc.  Ajnah etc.  Here the idea of the passage is this :  The  incoming of faith and the performance of activities intending this  [knowledge],  both spring up soon no doubt, if one, being a believer, entertains no doubt.  Therefore, one should remain being favoured by the preceptors and the scriptures, and not entertaining any doubt.  For, the doubt is a destroyer of everything  [good].  Indeed a person with doubt knows nothing, because he does not have faith.  Hence one should remain without doubt.					
 The subject matter that has been  elaborated in this entire chapter is now summarised by a pair of the [following] verses :
4.40 Ajnah, one who is ignorant, who has not known the Self; and asradda-dhanah, who is faithless; [Ast. adds here: guruvakya-sastresu avisvasavan, who has no faith in the instructions of the teacher and the scriptures.-Tr.] and samsaya-atma, who has a doubting mind; vinasyati, perishes. Although the ignorant and the faithless get ruined, yet it is not to the extent that a man with a doubting mind does. As for one with a doubting mind, he is the most vicious of them all. How? Na ayam lokah, neither this world which is familiar; na, nor also; parah, the next world; na sukham, nor happiness; asti, exist; samsaya-atmanah, for one who has a doubting mind. For doubt is possible even with regard to them! Therefore one should not entertain doubt.
Why?
4.41 He who has renounced actions by Yoga, whose doubts are rent asunder by knowledge, and who is self-possessed  actions do not bind him, O Arjuna.
4.41 But the man who has renounced his action for meditation, who has cleft his doubt in twain by the sword of wisdom, who remains always enthroned in his Self, is not bound by his acts.
4.41. O Dhananjaya !  Actions do not bind him who has renounced [all] actions through Yoga; who has cut off his doubts by the sword of knowledge; and who is a master of his own self.
4.41 Actions do not bind him, O Arjuna, who has renounced them through Karma Yoga and whose doubts are sundered by knowledge, and who therefore possesses a steady mind.
4.41 O Dhananjaya (Arjuna), actions do not bind one who has renounced actions through yoga, whose doubt has been fully dispelled by Knowledge, and who is not inadvertent.
4.41 The countless ancient Karmas which constitute the cause of bondage, do not bind him who has renounced actions through Karma Yoga in the manner explained before, who has sundered all doubts concerning the self by the knowledge of the self in the manner explained before, and who is of steady mind, i.e., unshakable, with the mind focussed steadily on the meaning that has been forth.
4.41 Yoga-etc.  Renunciation of actions becomes possible only through Yoga and not otherwise.  This has been discussed also [in the seel].
4.41 Yoga-sannyasta-karmanam, one who has renounced actions through yoga: that person who is a knower of the supreme Goal, by whom actions called righteous or unrighteous have been renounced through the yoga characterized as the Knowledge of the supreme Goal.
How does one become detached from actions through yoga? The Lord says: He is jnana-samchinna-samsayah, one whose doubts (samsaya) have been fully dispelled (samchinna) by Knowledge (jnana) characterized as the realization of the identity of the individual Self and God.
O Dhananjaya, he who has thus renounced actions through yoga, atmavantam, who is not inadvertent, not careless; him, karmani, actions, seen as the activities of the gunas (see 3.28); na nibadhnanti, do not bind, (i.e.) they do not produce a result in the form of evil etc.
Since one whose doubts have been destroyed by Knowledge-arising from the destruction of the impurities (of body, mind, etc.) as result of the practise of Karma-yoga-does not get bound by acitons owing to the mere fact of his actions having been burnt away by Knowledge; and since one who has doubts with regard to the practice of the yogas of Knowledge and actions gets ruined-
4.42 Therefore with the sword of the knowledge (of the Self) cut asunder the doubt of the self born of ignorance, residing in thy heart, and take refuge in Yoga. Arise, O Arjuna.
4.42 Therefore, cleaving asunder with the sword of wisdom the doubts of the heart, which thine own ignorance has engendered, follow the Path of Wisdom and arise!"
4.42. Therefore, thus cutting off, by means of knowledge-sword, the doubt that has sprung from ignornace and exists in [your] heart, practise the Yoga !  Stand up !  O descendant of Bharata !
4.42 Therefore, sunder, with the sword of knowledge, this doubt present in your heart resulting from ignorance concerning the self. Practise this Yoga, O Arjuna, and rise up.
4.42 Therefore, O scion of the Bharata dyasty, take recourse to yoga and rise up, cutting asunder with the sword of Knowledge this doubt of your own in the heart, arising from ignorance.
4.42 Therefore, after sundering this doubt concerning the self, born of beginningless ignorance and present in the heart, by the sword of the knowledge of the self in the manner explained before, practise the Karma Yoga taught by Me. For that, rise up, O Arjuna.
4.42  Tasmat  etc.  Cutting asunder the doubt,  you must practise,  by the said method, the Yoga, the dexterity in action;  and then stand up i.e.,  perform your activities simply with the idea that they are to be performed.
4.42 Tasmat, therefore, O scion of the Bharata dynasty; atistha, take recourse to, i.e. undertake; yogam, yoga -performance of actions, which is a means to full Illumination; and now, uttistha, rise up for battle; chittva, cutting asunder; jnanasina, with the sword of Knowledge-Knowledge is full Illumination, which is a destroyer of such defects as sorrows, delusion, etc.; that itself is the sword; with that sword of Knowledge-;enam, this; samsayam, doubt; atmanah, of your own, which is a source of one's own ruin and is most sinful; hrtstham, in the heart, residing in the intellect; ajnana-sambhutam, arising from ignorance, born of non-discrimination.
The word atmanah is used because doubt concerns oneself. Indeed, another's doubt cannot be removed by someone else. Hence the word 'own' is used. So, although the doubt is with regard to the Self, it is really one's own.
4.5 The Blessed Lord said  Many births of Mine have passed as well as of thine, O Arjuna; I know them all but thou knowest not, O Parantapa (scorcher of foes).
4.5 Lord Shri Krishna replied: I have been born again and again, from time to time; thou too,O Arjuna! My births are known to Me, but thou knowest not thine.
4.5. The Bhagavat said  O Arjuna,  many births of Mine,  as well as of yours have passed.  All of them I do know,  but you do not,  O scorcher of foes !
4.5 The Lord said  Many births of Mine have passed, O Arjuna, and so is it with you also. I know them all, but you do not know them.
4.5 The Blessed Lord said  O Arjuna, many lives of Mine have passed, and so have yours. I know them all, (but) you know not, O scorcher of enemies!
4.5 The Lord said  By this, the reality of the Lord's birth is declared in the sentence, 'Many births of Mine have passed.' 'So is it with you' is added by way of illustration.

The mode of incarnation, the reality of His body and the cause of His birth are explained in the following verse.
4.5 See Comment under 4.9
4.5 O Arjuna, bahuni, many; janmani, lives; me, of Mine; vyatitani, have passed; tava ca, and so have yours. Aham, I; veda know; tani, them; sarvani, all; (but) tvam, you; va vetta, know not, due to your power of understanding being obstructed by righteousness, unrighteousness, etc. However, parantapa, O scorcher of foes; aham, I know, possessing as I do unobstructed power of knowledge, because by nature I am enternal, pure, enlightened and free.
'In that case, how, in spite of the absence of righteousness and unrighteousness, can there be any birth for You who are the eternal God?'
That is beng answered:
4.6 Though I am unborn, of imperishable nature, and though I am the Lord of all beings, yet, governing My own Nature, I am born by My own Maya.
4.6 have no beginning. Though I am imperishable, as well as Lord of all that exists, yet by My own will and power do I manifest Myself.
4.6. Though  [I am]  unborn and the changeless Self;  though I am the the Lord of  [all]  beings; yet presiding over My own nature I take birth by My own Trick-of-illusion.
4.6 Though I am birthless and of immutable nature, though I am the Lord of all beings, yet by employing My own Nature (Prakrti) I am born out of My own free will.
4.6 Though I am birthless, undecaying by nature, and the Lord of beings, (still) by subjugating My Prakriti, I take birth by means of My own Maya.
4.6 Without forsaking any of the My special alities, as supreme rulership, birthless, imperishability etc., I am born by My free will. Prakrti means one's own nature. The meaning is that by employment of My own Nature and taking a form of My choice, I incarnate by My own will (Maya).

The character of My own Nature becomes evident from the following Srutis:  'Him who is of sun-like colour, beyond darkness (Tamas)' (Sve. U., 3.8), 'Him who abides beyond Rajas (active matter)' (Sama 17.1.4.2); 'This Golden Person who is within the sun' (Cha. U. 1.6.6); 'Within the heart, there is the Person consisting of mind, immortal and golden' (Tai. U. 1.6.1); 'All mortal creatures have come from the self-luminous Person' (Yaj., 32.2); 'Whose form is light, whose will is truth, who is the self of ethereal space, who contains all actions, contains all desires, contains all odours, contains all tastes' (Cha. U., 3.14.2); 'Like a raiment of golden colour' (Br. U., 4.3.6).

'Atma-mayaya' means through the Maya which belongs to Myself. Here the term Maya is identical with knowledge as stated in the lexicon of Yaska:  'Maya is wisdom, knowledge.' Further there is the usage of competent people:  'By Maya, He knows the good and bad of his creatures.' Hence by My own knowledge means 'by My will.' Hence, without abandoning My essential attributes which belong to Me the Lord of all, such as being free of sins, having auspicious attributes etc., and creating My own form similar to the configuration of gods, men etc., I incarnate in the form of gods etc. The Sruti teaches the same thing:  'Being unborn, He is born in various forms' (Tai. A., 3.12.7). The purport is that His birth is ite unlike that of ordinary beings. The dissimilarity consists in that He is born out of His own will unlike ordinary beings whose birth is necessitated by their Karma. Thus constured, there is no contradiction also between what was taught earlier and what is taught later as in the statements:  'Many births of Mine have passed, O Arjuna, and similarly yours also. I know them all' (4.5); 'I incarnate Myself' (4.7); and 'He who thus knows in truth My birth and work' (4.9). [All this elaboration is meant to refute the doctrine of mere apparency of incarnations as taught by the Advaitins. Ramanuja, as stated in his Introduction to the Bhasya, upholds the absolute reality of incarnations.]

Sri Krsna now specifies the times of His incarnations.
4.6 See Comment under 4.9
4.6 Api, san ajah, though I am birthless; and avyayatma, undecaying by nature, though I am naturally possessed of an undiminishing power of Knowledge; and so also api san, though; isvarah, the Lord, natural Ruler; bhutanam, of beings, from Brahma to a clump of grass; (still) adhisthaya, by subjugating; svam, My own; prakrtim, Prakrti, the Maya of Visnu consisting of the three gunas, under whose; spell the whole world exists, and deluded by which one does not know one's own Self, Vasudeva;-by subjugating that Prakrti of Mine, sambhavami, I take birth, appear to become embodeid, as though born; atma-mayaya, by means of My own Maya; but not in reality like an ordinary man.
It is being stated when and why that birth occurs:
4.7 Whenever there is decline of righteousness, O Arjuna, and rise of unrighteousness, then I manifest Myself.
4.7 Whenever spirituality decays and materialism is rampant, then, O Arjuna, I reincarnate Myself!
4.7. For, whenever there is a decay of righteousness and the rise of unrighteousness, then, O descendant  of Bharata,  I send forth (or create) that is which the Self is unimportant.
4.7 Whenever there is a decline of Dharma, O Arjuna, and uprising of Adharma, then I incarnate Myself.
4.7 O scion of the Bharata dynasty, whenever there is a decline one virtue and increase of vice, then do I manifest Myself.
4.7 There is no restriction as to the time of My birth; whenever the Dharma taught by the Vedas that must be observed according to the arrangements of the four stations and the four stages of life declines, and Adharma, its opposite, increases, then I Myself, by My own will and in the manner stated, incarnate Myself.

Sri Krsna gives the purpose of His birth.
4.7 See Comment under 4.9
4.7 O scion of the Bharata dynasty, yada yada hi, whenever; bhavati, there is; a glanih, decline, decrease; dharmasya, of virtue consisting of the duties of castes and stages of life of living beings, which are the means to achieving properity and Liberation; and abhyutthanam, increase, rise; adharmasya, of vice; tada, then; do aham, I; srjami, manifest; atmanam, Myself, through Maya.
Why?
4.8 For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked and for the establishment of righteousness, I am born in every age.
4.8 To protect the righteous, to destroy the wicked and to establish the kingdom of God, I am reborn from age to age.
4.8. For the protection of the good people, and for the destruction of evil-doers, and for the purpose of firmly establishing righteousness,  I take birth in every age.
4.8 For the protection of the good and also for the destruction of the wicked, for the establishment of Dharma, am I born from age to age.
4.8 For the protection of the pious, the destruction of the evil-doers, and establishing virtue, I manifest Myself in every age.
4.8 The good are those who follow the Dharma, as defined above. They are the foremost among the Vaisnavas, who have taken refuge in Me. While My name, acts and form are inaccessible to speech and thought, these devotees cannot get support, sustenance etc., for themselves without perceiving Me. They regard even a moment's time without Me as a thousand Kalpas. They become broken in every limb because of the separation from Me. So I am born from age to age in the forms of gods, men etc., for protecting them by affording them the opportunity to behold My form and acts and to converse with Me.

I am born also for the destruction of those who are opposed to such devotees and for the restoration of declining Vedic Dharma, which consists of My worship. The main purpose of incarnation is the revealing of His adorable form, so that all may worship Him. The destruction of the wicked is secondary only. There is no specific restrictions of the Yugas like Krta, Treta etc., for the appearance of Divine Incarnations.
4.8 See Comment under 4.9
4.8 Paritranaya, for the protection; sadhunam, of the pious, the followers of the virtuous path; vinasaya, for the destruction; duskrtam, of the evil-doers, of the sinful ones; and also dharmasamsthapanarthaya, for establishing virtue fully;-for that purpose, sambhavami, I manifest Myself; yuge yuge, in every age.
4.9 He who thus know, in their true light, My divine birth and action, having abandoned the body, is not born again, he comes to Me, O Arjuna.
4.9 He who realises the divine truth concerning My birth and life is not born again; and when he leaves his body, he becomes one with Me.
4.9. Whosoever knows thus correctly the divine birth and action of Mine, he, on abandoning the body does not go to rirth,  [but]  goes to Me,  O Arjuna !
4.9 He who thus knows in truth My divine birth and actions does not get rirth after leaving the body; he will come to Me, O Arjuna.
4.9 He who thus knows truly the divine birth and actions of Mine does not get rirth after casting off the body. He attains Me, O Arjuna.
4.9 He who knows truly My life and actions, super-natural and special to Me, which are intended solely for the protection of the good and to enable them to take refuge in Me, - Me who am devoid of birth, unlike ordinary beings whose birth is caused by Karma associated with Prakrti and its three Gunas producing the evil of bondage, and who is endowed with auspicious attributes such as Lordship over all, omniscience, infallible will etc., - such a person after abandoning the present body will never be born, but will reach Me only. By true knowledge of My divine birth and acts, all his sins that stand in his way of taking refuge in Me are destroyed. In this birth itself, resorting to Me in the manner already described, and loving Me and concentrating on Me alone, he reaches Me.

Sri Krsna speaks of the same thing:
4.5-9 Bahuni etc. upto  Arjuna.  Indeed the Bhagavat is Himself devoid  of all bodily  connections on account of His having the group  of the  'six  attributes'  in toto.  Yet, out of His nature of stabilising  [the universe], and out of compassion,  He sends  forth (or creates)  that is which the Self is secondary.  The meaning is this :  He takes hold of a body, in which  the Self,  with the group  of 'six alities' in full, remains secondary because of  Its  role as a helper of the body.  On account of this,  His birth is divine.  For, it has been created not by the results of actions,  but by His own Trick-of-Illusion, by the highest knowledge of Yoga,  and by the energy of Freedom  of  His own.  His action too is divine, as it is incabable  of yielding fruits  [for Him].  Whosoever  knows this truth in this manner i.e.,  realises  in his own Self  also in this manner, he necessarily understands the Bhagavat  Vasudeva beng.
4.9 Yah, he who; evam, thus, as described; vetti, knows tattvatah, truly, as they are in reality; that divyam, divine, supernatural; janma, birth, which is a form of Maya; ca karma, and actions, such as protection of the pious, etc.; mama, of Mine; na eti, does not get; punarjanma, rirth; tyaktva, after casting off; this deham, body. Sah, he; eti, attains, comes to; mam, Me-he gets Liberated, O Arjuna.
This path of Liberation has not been opened recently. What then? Even in earlier days-
5.1 Arjuna said  Renunciation of actions, O Krishna, Thou praisest, and again Yoga. Tell me conclusively that which is the better of the two.
5.1 "Arjuna said: My Lord! At one moment Thou praisest renunciation of action; at another, right action. Tell me truly, I pray, which of these is the more conducive to my highest welfare?
5.1. Arjuna said  O krsna, you commend renunciation of action and again the Yoga of action; which one of these two is superior [to the other] ?   Please tell me that for certain.
5.1 Arjuna said  You praise, O Krsna, the renunciation of actions and then praise Karma Yoga also. Tell me with certainly which of these is the superior one leading to the ultimate good.
5.1 Arjuna said  O Krsna, You praise renunciation of actions, and again, (Karma-) yoga. Tell me for certain that one which is better between these two.
5.1 Arjuna said  'You praise the renunciation of actions, i.e., Jnana Yoga at one time, and next Karma Yoga'. This is what is objected to:  In the second chapter, you have said that Karma Yoga alone should be practised first by an aspirant for release; and that the vision of the self should be achieved by means of Jnana Yoga by one whose mind has its blemishes washed away by Karma Yoga. Again, in the third and fourth chapters, you have praised Karma Yoga or devotion to Karma as better than Jnana Yoga even for one who has attained the stage of Jnana Yoga, and that, as a means of attaining the self, it (Karma Yoga) is independent of Jnana Yoga. Therefore, of these two, Jnana Yoga and Karma Yoga - tell me precisely which by itself is superior, i.e., most excellent, being more easy to practise, and icker to confer the vision of the self.
5.1 Samnyasam etc.  Is renunciation superior or Yoga ?  this  is the estion of the doubting person (Arjuna).
5.1 (O Krsna,) samsasi, You praise, i.e. speak of; sannyasam, renunciation; karmanam, of actions, of performance of various kinds of rites enjoined by the scriptures; punah ca, and again; You praise yogam, yoga, the obligatory performance of those very rites! Therefore I have a doubt as to which is better-Is the performance of actions better, or their rejection? And that which is better should be undertaken. And hence, bruhi, tell; mam, me; suniscitam, for certain, as the one intended by You; tat ekam, that one-one of the two, since performance of the two together by the same person is impossible; yat, which; is sreyah, better, more commendable; etayoh, between these two, between the renunciation of actions and the performance of actions [Ast. reads karma-yoga-anusthana (performance of Karma-yoga) in place of karma-anusthana (performance of actions).-Tr.], by undertaking which you think I shall acire what is beneficial.
While stating His own opinion in order to arrive at a conclusion-
5.10 He who does actions, offering them to Brahman, and abandoning attachment, is not tainted by sin, just as a lotus-leaf is not tainted by water.
5.10 He who dedicates his actions to the Spirit, without any personal attachment to them, he is no more tainted by sin than the water lily is wetted by water.
5.10. Who performs actions by offering them to the Brahman and giving up attachment-he is not stained by sin just as the lotus-leaf is  [not stained]  by water.
5.10 He who acts without attachment, reposing all actions on Brahman (Prakrti), is untouched by evil, as a lotus-leaf by water.
5.10 One who acts by dedicating actions to Brahman and by renouncing attachment, he does not become polluted by sin, just as a lotus leaf is not by water.
5.10 Here the term, Brahman denotes Prakrti. Later on Sri Krsna will say:  'The great Brahman is My womb' (14.3). Since Prakrti abides in the form of senses which are particular off-shoots of Prakrti, he who, as said in the passage beginning with 'Even though he is seeing, hearing ৷৷.' (5.8), understands that all actions proceed from Brahman (Prakrti); renounces all attachment while engaging himself in all actions, reflecting, 'I am doing nothing.' Such a person, though existing in contact with Prakrti, is not contaminated by sin which is the result of the wrong identification of the Atman with Prakrti and is the cause of bondage. Just as a lotus leaf is not wetted by water, actions do not affect or defile a person with sin, if he is free from such identification with the body.
5.10 See Comment under 5.11
5.10 On the other hand, again, one who is ignorant of the Truth and is engaged in Karma-yoga, yah, who; karoti, acts; adhaya, by dedicating, by surrendering; all karmani, actions; brahmani, to Brahman, to God; with the idea, 'I am working for Him, as a servant does everything for his master', and tyaktva, by renouncing; sangam, attachment, even with regard to teh resulting Liberation; sah, he; na lipyate, does not get polluted, is not affected; papena, by sin; iva, just as; padma-patram, a lotus leaf; is not ambhasa, by water.
The only result that will certainly accrue from such action will be the purification of the heart.
5.11 Yogis, having abandoned attachment, perform actions only by the body, mind, intellect, and even by the senses, for the purification of the self.
5.11 The sage performs his action dispassionately, using his body, mind and intellect, and even his senses, always as a means of purification.
5.11. Having given up attachment, the men of Yoga perform action,  just  with the body, with the mind, with intellect and also with sense-organs, for attaining the Self.
5.11 Merely witth the body, the mind, the intellect and the senses, Yogins do actions, renouncing attachment, for the purification of the self.
5.11 By giving up attachment, the yogis undertake work merely through the body, mind, intellect and even the organs, for the purification of themselves.
5.11 Renouncing attachment to heaven etc., the Yogins perform actions accomplishable by the body, the mind and the intellect for the purification of themselves, i.e., for annulling the bonds of his previous Karma which have afected the self and which involve the self in Samsara.
5.7-11 Yogayuktah etc. upto  atma-siddhaye.  He, whose  (by whom)  Self is  [realised to be]  the Self of all beings, is not stained,  eventhough he performs all  [sorts of]  actions.   For, he has undertaken neither what is enjoined nor what is prohibited.   Hence,  even while performing actions such as seeing and the like, he bears in mind, -i.e., he resolves with [all]  firmness of observation, - that 'If the sense-organs like eyes etc., function on their respective objects, what does it matter for me ?  Indeed one is not stained by what another does'.  This act is nothing but dedicating one's actions to the Brahman.  In this regard the characteristic mark is his detachment.  Due to that he is not stained.  Because they do not have attachment,  the men of Yoga perform  actions only with their body etc.,  that are freed from attachment and do not depend on each other.
5.11 Since tyaktva, by giving up sangam, attachment with regard to results; yoginah, the yogis, men of action; kurvanti, undertake; karma, work; kevalaih, merely- this word is to be construed with each of the words, body etc., so as to deny the idea of ownership with regard to all actions-; kayena, through the body; manasa, through the mind; buddhya, through the intellect; and api, even; indriyaih, through the organs, which are devoid of the idea of ownership, which are unassociated with ownership thus: 'I act only for God, and not for my gain'; atmasudhaye, for the purification of themselves, i.e., for the purification of the heart, therefore you have competence only for that. So you undertake action alone.
And also since,
5.12 The united one (the well poised or the harmonised) having abandoned the fruit of action attains to the eternal peace: the non-united only (the unsteady or the unbalanced) impelled by desire, attached to the fruit, is bound.
5.12 Having abandoned the fruit of action, he wins eternal peace. Others unacquainted with spirituality, led by desire and clinging to the benefit which they think will follow their actions, become entangled in them.
5.12. Having abandoned [the attachment for] the fruit of actions, the master of Yoga attains the highest Peace.  [But] the person, other than the master of Yoga, attached to the fruit of action, is  bound by his action born of desire.
5.12 A Yogin, renouncing the fruits of his actions, attains lasting peace. But the unsteady man who is attached to fruits of actions, being impelled by desire, is bound.
5.12 Giving up the result of work by becoming resolute in faith, one attains Peace arising from steadfastness. One who is lacking in resolute faith, being attached to the result under the impulsion of desire, becomes bound.
5.12 A Yogin is one who has no hankering for fruits other than the self, and who is exclusively devoted to the self. If a man renounces the fruits of actions and performs actions merely for the purification of himself, he attains lasting peace, i.e., he attains bliss which is of the form of lasting experience of the self. The unsteady person is one who is inclined towards fruits other than the self. He has turned himself away from the vision of the self. Being impelled by desire, he becomes attached to fruits of actions, and remains bound for ever by them. That is, he becomes a perpetual Samsarin or one involved in transmigratory cycle endlessly. What is said is this:  Free of attachment for fruits and attributing one's actions to Prakrti which has developed into the form of senses, one should perform actions merely to free the self from bondage.

Next, the shifting of agency to Prakrti, from which the body has come into existence, is described:
5.12 Yuktah etc. Highest :  that  from which there is no return.
5.12 Tyaktva, giving up; karma-phalam, the result of work; yuktah, by becoming resolute in faith, by having this conviction thus-'Actions are for God, not for my gain'; apnoti, attains; santim, Peace, called Liberation; naisthikim arising from steadfastness. It is to be understood that he attains this through the stages of purification of the heart, acisition of Knowledge, renunciation of all actions, and steadfastness in Knowledge.
On the other hand, however, he who is ayuktah, lacking in resolute faith; he, phale saktah, being attached to result; thinking, 'I am doing this work for my gain'; kama-karena, under the impulsion of desire-kara is the same as karana (action); the action of desire (kama-kara; under that impulsion of desire, i.e. being prompted by desire; nibadhyate, gets bound. Therefore you become resolute in faith. This is the idea.
But one who has experienced the supreme Reality-
5.13 Mentally renouncing all actions and self-controlled, the embodied one rests happily in the nine-gated city, neither acting nor causing others (body and senses) to act.
5.13 Mentally renouncing all actions, the self-controlled soul enjoys bliss in this body, the city of the nine gates, neither doing anything himself nor causing anything to be done.
5.13. Having renounced all actions by mind, a man of self-control, dwells happily in his body, a nine-win-dowed mansion, neither performing, nor causing others to perform [actions].
5.13 The embodied self, mentally resigning all actions as belonging to the city of nine gates (i.e., the body) and becoming self-controlled, dwells happily, neither himself acting nor causing the body to act.
5.13 The embodied man of self-control, having given up all actions mentally, continues happily in the town of nine gates, without doing or causing (others) to do anything at all.
5.13 The embodied self who is self-controlled, renounces all actions to the city of nine gates, i.e., the body with its sensory and motor functions which are nine in number. He discriminates that all actions are due to conjunction of the self with the body which is rooted in previous Karmas, and is not by Its own nature. [It means that the self merely rests in the body, without any identification with bodily activities.]

Sri Krsna now teaches the natural condition of the self as It is:
5.13 Sarva - etc. [He would view as] :  'Just as for a person within a house there is no connection with dilapidation etc.,  that are found in the house, in the same way for me too residing in the body-house beautified with nine windows in the form of openings like the eyes etc., there is no connection with its attributes.'	
 For -
5.13 Aste, he continues; sukham, happily; sannyasya, having given up; sarva-karmani, all actions-nitya, naimittika, kamya and nisiddha (prohibited actions); [See note on p. 128.-Tr.] manasa, mentally, through discriminating wisdom-i.e. having given up (all actions) by seeing inaction in action, etc. Freed from the activities of speech, mind and body, effortles, placid in mind, and devoid of all external wants which are different from the Self, he continues happily. This is what has been said.
Where and how does the vasi, man of self-control, i.e. one who has his organs under control, remain? This is being answered: Nava-dvare pure, in the town with nine gates, of which seven [Two ears, two eyes nostrils, and mouth.] are in the head for one's own experiences, and two are below for urination and defecation. As possessed of those gates, it is called the 'town with nine gates'. Being like a town, the body is called a town with the Self as its only master. And it is inhabited by the organs, mind, intellect and objects, like citizens, as it were, which serve its needs and which are productive of many results and experience. Renouncing all actions, the dehi, embodied one, resides in that town with nine gates.
Objection: What is the need of this specification? For all embodied beings, be they monks or not, reside in bodies to be sure! That being so, the specification is needless.
The answer is: The embodied one, however, who is unenlightened, who perceives merely the aggregate of the body and organs as the Self, he, in his totality, thinks, 'I am in a house, on the ground, or on the seat.' For one who experiences the body alone as the Self, there can certainly be no such conviction as, 'I am in the body, like one's being in a house.' But, for one who realizes the Self as distinct from the aggregate of body etc. it becomes reasonable to have the conviction, 'I am in the bdoy. It is reasonable that as a result of knowledge in the form of discriminating wisdom, there can be a mental renunciation of the actions of others, which have been ignorantly superimposed on the supreme Self. Even in the case of one in whom has arisen discriminating wisdom and who has renounced all actions, there can be, like staying in a house, the continuance in the body itself-the town with nine gates-as a conseence of the persistence of the remnants of the results of past actions which have started bearing fruit, because the awareness of being distinct (from the body) arises while one is in the body itself. Form the point of veiw of the difference between the convictions of the enlightened and the unenlightened persons, the alifying words, 'He continues in the body itself', do have a purpose to serve.
Although it has been stated that one continues (in the body) by relinishing actions of the body and organs ignorantly superimposed on the Self, still there may be the apprehesion that direct or indirect agentship inheres in the Self. Anticipating this, the Lord says: na eva kurvan, without himself doing anything at all; and na karayan, not causing (others) to do, (not) inducing the body and organs to activity.
Objection: Is it that the direct or indirect agentship of the embodied one inheres in the Self and ceases to be after renunciation, as the movement of a traveller ceases with the stoppage of his movement? Or, is it that they do not exist owing to the very nature of the Self?
As to this, the answer is: The Self by Its nature has neither direct nor indirect agentship. For it was stated, 'It is said that৷৷.This (Self) is unchangeable' (2.25). 'O son of Kunti, although existing in the body, It does not act, nor is It affected' (13.31). And it is also stated in the Upanisad, 'It seems to meditate, as it were; It seems to move, as it were' (Br. 4.3.7).
5.14 Neither agency nor actions does the Lord create for the world, nor union with the fruits of actions. But it is Nature that acts.
5.14 The Lord of this universe has not ordained activity, or any incentive thereto, or any relation between an act and its consequences. All this is the work of Nature.
5.14. The Lord (Self) acires neither the state of being a creator of the world, nor the actions, nor the connecting with the fruits of their actions.  But it is the inherent nature [in It] that exerts.
5.14 The lord of the body (the self i.e., the Jiva) does not create agency, nor actions, nor union with the fruits of actions in relation to the world of selves. It is only the inherent tendencies that function.
5.14 The Self does not create agentship or any objects (of desire) for anyone; nor association with the results of actions. But it is Nature that acts.
5.14 When the world of embodied selves exists in conjunction with the Prakrti in the form of gods, animals, men, immobile things etc., the master (Prabhu i.e., the Jiva who is the master of the body), who is not subject to Karma and is established in Its own essential nature, does not bring about:  (i) the agency of gods, men etc. (ii) their manifold and particular actions and (iii) their connection with the fruits in the form of embodiment as gods etc., resulting from their actions. Who then brings about agency etc.?  It is only the tendencies that act. A tendency (Svabhava) is subtle impressions (Vasanas) originating from Prakrti. The meaning is that agency, etc., do not originate from the natural or pristine condition of the self but are generated by the subtle impressions created by misconceiving those forms of Prakrti etc., as of the self. This is the result of the conjunction of the self with Prakrti in the form of gods, etc., which has been generated by the flow of previous Karmas brought about in beginningless time.
5.14 Na  kartrtvam etc.  This Soul does not do anything for anything.  But, Its exertion is only Its inherent nature and it is not due to any desire for results.  For, the Bhagavat, the Conscious Energy Itself  Whose ultimately true inherent nature is the Illumination-Bliss-Freedom-of-Will, and Which brings out, merely by Its own nature, the continuous series of creation, manitenance and withdrawl of all (the Universe); hence in It,  there is never a departure, even to a little extent, from Its own inherent nature.  Hence there is no such thing as a particular stage of being a creator i.e., a creatorhood separate [from Itself].  Because that does not exist, what actions can be there ?  If actions are not there,  the fruit is to be of what or for whom ?  Then what connection could be three with the fruit of action ?
 
[Further],  'action'  in this context is [only]  the  kriya-[sakti] or creative energy  [which is nothing but His will],  and 'result of action'  too in only the fruit of this kriya.  For example, the activity like rotating the [potter's]  wheel by the stick is not [actually]  different  [from what is to be created  i.e.,  the pot].  Nor the creator of the pot is different from it.  For, all exist within the Conscious  Energy. Therefore, it is only the Animate  Sovereign  Supreme  Lord  that manifests in this and that form.  Therefore there exist no activity and its result etc.,  apart from  That.  This is demonstrated conclusion  [of the scriptures].			
 So, if there is no activity or its result  [as stated above],  then even the result, ordained in  [the scriptural] injunctions  cannot have a status of being produced by the unseen  [cause].  After saying this in the other first  hemistich  [of the following verse],  the Lord justifies in the other hemistich the same statement with reference to the men of mundane life :-
5.14 Prabhuh, the Self; na srjati, does not create; lokasya, for anyone; kartrtvam, agentship, by saying 'Do this'; or even karmani, any objects-such objects as chariot, pot, palace, etc. which are intensely longed for; nor even karma-phala-samyogam, association with the results of actions-association of the creator of a chariot etc. with the result of his work.
Objection: If the embodied one does not do anything himself, and does not make others do, then who is it that engages in work by doing and making others do?
The answer is: Tu, but; it is svabhavah, Nature- one's own (sva) nature (bhava)-characterized as ignorance, Maya, which will be spoken of in, 'Since this divine Maya' (7.14); pravartate, that acts.
But from the highest standpoint-
5.15 The Lord takes neither the demerit nor even the merit of any; knowledge is enveloped by ignorance, thery beings are deluded.
5.15 The Lord does not accept responsibility for any man's sin or merit. Men are deluded because in them wisdom is submerged in ignorance.
5.15. The Omnimanifest (Soul) takes [upon Itself] neither sin nor merit [born] of any [action].  But, the perfect knowledge is clouded by Illusion and hence the creatures are deluded.
5.15 The all-pervading One takes away neither the sin nor the merit of any one. Knowledge is enveloped by ignorance. Creatures are thery deluded.
5.15 The Omnipresent neither accepts anybody's sin nor even virtue. Knowledge remains covered by ignorance. Thery the creatures become deluded.
5.15 Because, It, the Atman is 'all-pervading', i.e., is not limited to particular area or space included in the bodies of gods, men etc.; It is not the relative or the enemy of any one. For this reason It does not take away or remove the evil or suffering of anyone such as a son who is related and therefore dear to one; nor does It take away, i.e., remove the happiness of anyone whom It deems with aversion. All this is the effect of Vasanas or subtle impressions of Prakrti.

How does do these contrary Vasanas originte in the case of one whose intrinsic nature is a described above?  In answer it is said that knowledge is enveloped by the darkness of ignorance. The Atman's knowledge is enveloped, i.e., contracted by preceding Karmas which are opposed to knowledge, so that a person may be alified to experience the fruits of his own Karma. It is by this Karma, which contracts knowledge, and can join the Jiva with the bodies of gods etc., that the misconception that the bodies are the selves is produced. Conseently there will originate the Vasanas or the unconscious subtle impressions born of such misapprehension of the self and the inclination to undertake actions corresponding to them.

Sri Krsna now brings into proper seence what has been taught before in the following verses:  'You will completely cross over the sea of all your sins with the boat of knowledge' (4.36), and 'The fire of knowledge reduces all Karmas to ashes in the same way' (4.37), and 'For there is no purifier here eal to knowledge' (4.38).
5.15 Nadatte etc.  The sinful acts and the like have been effected not by the Soul; but they have been effected by the Illusion belonging to It, just as a poison is effected in the nectar by a doubt.
 
Therefore-
5.15 Vibhuh, the Omnipresent; na adatte, neither accetps; kasyacit, anybody's-even a adevotee's; papam, sin; na ca eva, nor even; does He accept sukrtam, virtue offered by devotees. Why then are such virtuous acts as worship etc. as also sacrifices, charity, oblation, etc. worship etc. as also sacrifices, charity, oblation, etc. offered by devotees? To this the Lord says: Jnanam, knowledge, discriminating wisdom; remains avrtam, covered; ajnanena, by ignorance. Tena, thery; jantavah, the creatures, the non-discriminating people in the world; muhyanti, become deluded thus-'I do; I make others do; I eat; I make others eat.'
5.16 But to those whose ignorance is destroyed by the knowledge of the Self, like the sun, knowledge reveals the Supreme (Brahman).
5.16 Surely wisdom is like the sun, revealing the supreme truth to those whose ignorance is dispelled by the wisdom of the Self.
5.16. In the case of those whose Illusion has been, however, destroyed by the Self-knowledge, then for them that knowledge illumines itself, like the sun.
5.16 But for those in whom this ignorance is destroyed by the knowledge of the self, that knowledge, in their case, is supreme and shines like the sun.
5.16 But in the case of those of whom that ignorance of theirs becomes destroyed by the knowledge (of the Self), their Knowledge, like the sun, reveals that supreme Reality.
5.16 While all these selves are thus deluded, in the case of enlightened souls, their delusive ignorance - which envelops knowledge and which is of the form of accumulated, beginningless and endless Karma - is destroyed by knowledge. As already described this knowledge is produced by the teachings of the scriptures about the real nature of the self, which are enriched by daily practice. The purity of this knowledge is unexcelled. And in the case of those selves who regain the knowledge that is natural to Them, it is found that it is unlimited and uncontracted and illumining everything like the sun.

Plurality of the selves in Their essence is expressly mentioned in the case of those whose ignorance is overcome, in the expression 'for those' in the text. What was stated at the commencement, 'There never was a time when I did not exist' (2.12) is expressed here with greater clarity. Moreover, this plurality is not due to limiting adjuncts imposed on a single universal self. For, as stated here, there cannot be any trace of such adjuncts for those whose ignorance is destroyed, and still They are described as a plurality. Hence knowledge is taught as an attribute inseparable from the essential nature of the self, because a difference between the self and its knowledge is made out in the statement, 'Knowledge, in their case illuminates like the sun'. By the illustration of the sun, the relation of the knower to his knowledge is brought out to be similar to the luminous object and its luminosity. Therefore, it is appropriate to understand that knowledge contracts by Karma in the stage of Samsara and expands in the stage of Moksa (release). [In this system the Atman has two forms of Jnana or Knowledge - Dharmi-Jnana (self-awareness) and Dharma-bhuta-Jnana (awareness of objects other than itself). It is the latter that is contracted  by ignorance and expands by knowledge. See Intrdocution.]
5.16 Jnanena etc.  When however the  Illusion is destroyed by  knowledge, then  the natural  capacity of  knowledge,  in illuminating  itself  and  other things starts to work automatically just as the sun does when the darkness is lost.  Indeed when the doubt  [of poison] is completely rooted out, the nectar does  the work of the nectar just automatically.							
 But  this is possible for  those who have their intellect and mind gone to This  [Self]  and have abandoned  [all]  other  activities.  To make this idea clear  [the Lord] says -
5.16 Tu, but; yesam, in the case of those creatures; of whom tat ajnanam, that ignorance; atmanah, of theirs-being covered by which ignorance creatures get deluded-; nasitam, becomes destroyed; jnanena, by knowledge, by discriminating knowledge concerning the Self; tesam, their; jnanam, knowledge; adityavat, like the sun; prakasayati, reveals, in the same way as the sun reveals all forms whatever; tat-param, that supreme Reality, the Reality which is the highest Goal, the totality of whatever is to be known.
5.17 Their intellect absorbed in That, their self being That, established in That, with That for their supreme goal, they go whence there is no return, their sins dispelled by knowledge.
5.17 Meditating on the Divine, having faith in the Divine, concentrating on the Divine and losing themselves in the Divine, their sins dissolved in wisdom, they go whence there is no return.
5.17. Those, who have their intellect and self (mind) gone to This; who have established themselves in This and have This [alone] as their supreme goal; and who have washed off their sins by means of  [perfect]  knowledge-they reach a state from which there is no more return.
5.17 Those whose intellects pursue It (the self), whose minds think about It, who undergo discipline for It, and who hold It as their highest object, have their impurities cleansed by knowledge and go whence there is no return.
5.17 Those who have their intellect absorbed in That, whose Self is That, who are steadfast in That, who have That as their supreme Goal-they attain the state of non-returning, their dirt having been removed by Knowledge.
5.17 'Those whose intellects pursue It,' i.e., those who have determined to have the vision of the self in this way; 'those whose minds think about It,' i.e., those whose minds have the self for their aim, those who undergo discipline for It, i.e., those who are devoted to the practices for Its attainment; 'those who hold It as their highest object,' i.e., those who consider It as their highest goal - such persons, having their previous impurities cleansed by the knowledge which is practised in this way, attain the self as taught. 'From that state there is no return' - the state from which there is no return means the state of the self. The meaning is that they attain the self which rests in Its own nature.
5.17 Because it is only the inherent nature that exerts thus, therefore  [the Lord] says that the men,  who have destroyed their illusion would remain as follows -
5.17 Tat-buddhayah, those who have their intellect absorbed in That, [Here Ast. reads 'tasmin brahmani, in that Brahman'.-Tr.] in the supreme Knowledge which has been revealed; tat-atmanah, whose Self is That, who have That (tat) supreme Brahman Itself as their Self (atma); tat-nisthah, who are steadfast in That-nistha is intentness, exclusive devotion; they are called tat-nisthah who become steadfast only in Brahman by renouncing all actions; and tat-parayanah, who have That as their supreme (para) Goal (ayana), who have That alone as their supreme Resort, i.e. who are devoted only to the Self; those who have got their ignorance destroyed by Knowledge-those who are of this kind-, they gacchanti, attain; apunaravrttim, the state of non-returning, non-association again with a body; jnana-nirdhuta-kalmasah, their dirt having been removed, destroyed, by Knowledge. Those whose dirt (kalmasa), the defect in the form of sin etc., which are the cause of transmigration, have been removed, destryed (nirdhuta), by the aforesaid Knowledge (jnana) are jnana-nirdhuta-kalmasah, i.e. the monks.
How do those learned ones, whose ignorance regarding the Self has been destroyed by Knowledge, look upon Reality? That is being stated:
5.18 Sages look with an eal eye on a Brahmana endowed with learning and humility, on a cow, on an elephant, and even on a dog and an outcaste.
5.18 Sages look equally upon all, whether he be a minister of learning and humility, or an infidel, or whether it be a cow, an elephant or a dog.
5.18. The wise men look, by nature, eally upon a Brahmana, rich in learning and humility, on a cow, on an elephant, and on a mere dog and on a dog-cooker (an out-caste).
5.18 The sages look with an eal eye on one endowed with learning and humility, a Brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater.
5.18 The learned ones look with eanimity on a Brahmana endowed with learning and humality, a cow, an elephant and even a dog as well as an eater of dog's meat.
5.18 The sages are those who know the real nature of the self in all beings. They see the selves to be of the same nature, though they are perceived in extremely dissimlar embodiments such as those of one endowed with learning and humility, a mere Brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog, a dog-eater etc., because they all have the same form of knowledge in their nature as the Atman. The dissimilarity of the forms observed is due to Prakrti (body) and not to any dissimilarity in the self; conseently they, the wise, perceive the self as the same everywhere, because all selves, though distinct, have the same form of knowledge.
5.18 Vidya-etc.  So, regarding a Brahmana these men of Yoga entertain no such veiw as  'I shall become a man of merit by serving  him'  and so on;  regarding a cow,  no  [idea]  like  'It is purifying and sacred'  and so on; regarding an elephant, no thought  of  wealth and so on; regarding a dog,  no conviction that it is  impure, mischievous and  so on;  and with regard to a dog-cooker no  opinion that he is a sinner,  is impure and so on.  That is why it is said that  'they look eally  [upon these]'  and not that  'they act eally [with them].  This has been said as -
 
The Self,  which is of the nature of pure  Consciousness,  [shines] in he bodies of all; no discriminating factor exists anywhere.  Hence, the person who has conered the cycle of  birth-and-death, remains consdering all as fully absorbed in That  (Consciousness) (VB, verse 100).
 
Here too nothing but this stream of thought has been mentioned by  'remains considering'.									
 The  proper mental disposition of a man of wisdom, says  [the Lord], would be like this :
5.18 Panditah, the learned ones; sama-darsinah, look with equanimity; brahmane, on a Brahmana; vidya-vinayasampanne, endowed with learning and humility-vidya means knowledge of the Self, and vinaya means pridelessness-, on a Brahmana who has Self-knowledge and modesty; gavi, on a cow; hastini, on an elephant; ca eva, and even; suni, on a dog; ca, as well as; svapake, on an eater of dog's meat.Those learned ones who are habituated to see (equally) the unchanging, same and one Brahman, absolutely untouched by the qualities of sattva etc. and the tendencies created by it, as also by the tendencies born of rajas and tamas, in a Brahmana, who is endowed with Knowledge and tranquillity, who is possessed of good tendencies and the quality of sattva; in a cow, which is possessed of the middling quality of rajas and is not spiritually refined; and in an elephant etc., which are wholly and absolutely imbued with the quality of tamas-they are seers of equality.Objection: On the strength of the text, 'A sacrificer incurs sin by not adoring equally one who is an equal, and by adoring equally one who is an equal, to himself' (Gau. Sm. 17.20), are not they sinful, whose food should not be eaten?Reply: They are not open to the charge.Objection: How?
5.19 Even here (in this world) birth (everything) is overcome by those whose minds rest in eality; Brahman is spotless indeed and eal; therefore they are established in Brahman.
5.19 Even in this world they conquer their earth-life whose minds, fixed on the Supreme, remain always balanced; for the Supreme has neither blemish nor bias.
5.19. The Brahman-knower, who is disillusioned, who is established in Brahman and has a firm intellect, would neither rejoice on meeting a friend nor get agitated on meeting a foe.
5.19 Here itself Samsara is overcome by those whose minds rest in ealness. For the Brahman (individual self), when uncontaminated by Prakrti, is the same everywhere. Therefore they abide in Brahman.
5.19 Here [i.e. even while living in the body.] itself is rirth conered by them whose minds are established on sameness. Since Brahman is the same (in all) and free from defects, therefore they are established in Brahman.
5.19 By those whose minds rest in ealness with regard to all selves in the aforesaid manner, even here, i.e., even at the stage of executing the means, Samsara is overcome. For the Brahman is of the same nature everywhere when uncontaminated. The meaning is that the substance of self, when free from the contaminations resulting from contact with the Prakrti (body), is the same everywhere i.e., as the Brahman (the Atman). If they are fixed in the eality of all selves, they verily abide in Brahman. The abidance in the Brahman is verily the conest of Samsara. Those who contemplate on the sameness of all selves, because of their having the form of knowledge, they are liberated.

Sri Krsna now teaches that mode of life by following which the maturity of knowledge in the form of sameness of vision comes to a Karma Yogin.
5.19 This sloka does not exit in Gitartha sangraha of Abhinavagupta.
5.19 Iha eva, here itself, even while they are living; is sargah, rirth; jitah, conered, overcome; taih, by them, by the learned ones who see with eanimity; yesam, whose; manah, minds, the internal organs; are sthitam, established, made steadfast; samye, on sameness, in Brahman that exists as the same in all beings. It is nirdosam, free from defects. Because of Its existence in such mean objects as an eater of dog's meat, etc., though It is supposed by fools to be affected by the defects of those (objects), still It remains untouched by those blemishes, hi, because It is free from defects. Nor even is It differentiated by Its alities, since Consciousness is free from alifications. And the Lord will speak of desires etc. (cf. 13.6 etc.) as the attributes of the aggregate of body and organs, and will also say, 'Being without beginning and without alities' (13.31). Nor even are there the ultimate distinctions which can create differentiation in the Self, [According to the Vaisesikas, everything is possessed of not only alities but also of antya-visesa (ultimate distinction), which is a category like substance, ality, action, etc. This distinction makes every entity different from other entities. Thus, individual souls have their own ultimate distinctions by the very fact that they are individuals.
Vedanta denies such a category. Besides, the Self is one and omnipresent. Therefore there is nothing else from which It can be distinguished.-Tr.] because there is nothing to prove that these ultimate distinctions exist in every body.
Hence, samam brahma, Brahman is the same and one. Tasmat, therefore; te, they; sthitah, are established; brahmani, in Brahman Itself. As a result, not even a shade of defect touches them. For they have no self-identification in the form of perceiving the aggregate of body etc. as the Self.
On the other hand, that statement (Gau. Sm. 17.20) refers to the man who has self-identification in the form of perceiving the aggregate of body, (organs) etc. as the Self, for that statement-'A sacrificer incurs sin by not adoring eally one who is an eal, and by adoring eally one who is not eal to himself, pointedly refers to persons who are the objects of adoration. It is indeed seen that in worship, charity, etc. the determining factors are the possession of such special alities as being 'a knower of Brahman', 'versed in the six auxiliary branches of Vedic learning', and 'versed in the four Vedas'. But Brahman is bereft of association with all alities and defects. This being so, it is logical that they are established in Brahman. And 'adoring an eal, ৷৷.an uneal,' etc. has reference to men of action. [Those engaged in actions with a sense of agentship, etc.-Tr.] But this subject under consideration, beginning from 'The embodied man৷৷.having given up all actions mentally' (13) to the end of the chapter, is concerning one who has given up all actions.
Since the Self is Brahman which is without blemish and is the same (in all), therefore-
5.2 The Blessed Lord said  Renunciation and the Yoga of action both lead to the highest bliss; but of the two, the Yoga of action is superior to the renunciation of action.
5.2 Lord Shri Krishna replied: Renunciation of action and the path of right action both lead to the highest; of the two, right action is the better.
5.2. The Bhagavat said  Both renunciation and the Yoga of action effect salvation.  But, of these two, the Yoga of action is better than renunciation of action.
5.2 The Lord said  Renunciation of actions and Karma Yoga, both lead to the highest excellence. But, of the two, Karma Yoga excels the renunciation of actions.
5.2 The Blessed Lord said  Both renunciation of actions and Karma-yoga lead to Liberation. Between the two, Karma-yoga, however, excels over renunciation of actions.
5.2 The Lord said  Even while granting that some persons are competent for the practice of Jnana Yoga exclusively, it has to be conceded that renunciation, i.e., Jnana Yoga, and Karma Yoga can be practised as independent of each other in the pursuit of the highest excellence. Still, of these two, Karma Yoga excels over the renunciation of actions, i.e., Jnana Yoga.

Sri Krsna explains why this is so.
5.2 Samnyasah etc.  Renunciation and the Yoga of action-not only one, but two-are mentioned here.  Happily joining together they yield  salvation.  (However), the superiority of the Yoga [over the renunciation]  is due to the fact that but for the Yoga, renunciation does not exist.
5.2 Ubhau, both, to be sure; sannyasah, renunciation of actions; ca, and; karma-yogah, Karma-yoga-their performance-; nihsreyasa-karau, lead to Liberation. Though both lead to Liberation by virtue of being the cause of the rise of Knowledge, even then, tayoh, between the two which are the causes of Liberation; Karma-yoga, tu, however; visisyate, excels; karma-sannyasat, over mere renunciation of actions.
Thus He extols Karma-yoga. [Karma-yoga is better than renunciation of actions that is not based on Knowledge.]
Why? In answer the Lord says:
5.20 Resting in Brahman, with steady intellect and undeluded, the knower of Brahman neither rejoiceth on obtaining what is pleasant nor grieveth on obtaining what is unpleasant.
5.20 He who knows and lives in the Absolute remains unmoved and unperturbed; he is not elated by pleasure or depressed by pain.
5.20. He who, with his self (mind) not attached to the external contacts, finds happiness in the Self-that person, with his self engaged in the Yoga, pervades easily, suffering no loss, the Brahman.
5.20 He who knows Brahman (individual self) and abides in Brahman, whose mind is steadfastly on the self and undeluded by the body consciousness - he neither rejoices at gaining what is pleasant, nor grieves on obtaining what is unpleasant.
5.20 A knower of Brahman, who is established in Brahman, should have his intellect steady and should not be deluded. He should not get delighted by getting what is desirable, nor become dejected by getting what is undesirable.
5.20 Whatever is experienced as pleasant by one staying in a body and remaining in a particular condition because of the subtle impressions of his old Karmas, and whatever is experienced as unpleasant - on attaining those two types of experiences, one should not feel joy or grief. How?  By having the mind on that 'Which is steadfast' i.e., the self, 'Undeluded,' i.e., one must be free from the delusion of identity of the steadfast self with the transient body. And how can this be?  He who knows Brahman and abides in Brahman, i.e., by becoming a knower of Brahman by instruction by the teachers - such a person abides steadily, engaged in the practices towards winning Brahman.

What is said is this:  From the instructions received from the sages who know the truth, one should learn what has to be learnt about the self. Endeavouring to actualise the same, one does not consider the body as the sefl and remains fixed in the joyous experience of the vision of the steadfast self. Let him not rejoice and grieve when he experiences pleasant and unpleasant things, as such experiences result from the Prakrti and are transient.
5.20 Na prahrsyet etc.  In the case of this person,  who habitually looks  [upon all]  alike, the classification of foes  and friends is at the level of mundane business alone,  and not internally, as he is firmly established in the Brahman.
5.20 Brahmavit, a knower of Brahman, as described; sthitah, who is established; brahmani in Brahman- who is not a performer of actions, i.e. one who has renounced all actions; sthira-buddhih, should have his intellect steady-the man of steady intellect is one who has the unwavering, firm conviction of the existence of the one and the same taintless Self in all beings; and further, asammudhah, he should not be deluded, he should be free from delusion. Na prahrsyet, he should not get delighted; prapya, by getting; priyam, what is desirable; na ca udvijet, and surely, neither should he become dejected; prapya, by getting; apriyam, what is undesirable-because the acisition of the desirable and the undesirable are causes of [Ast.'s reading is 'horsa-visadau kurvate, cause happiness and sorrow' in place of 'harsa-visada-sthane, sources of happiness and sorrow', which (latter) reading occurs in G1. Pr. and A.A.-Tr.] happiness and sorrow for one who considers the body as the Self; not for the one who has realized the absolute Self, since in his case there can be no acisition of desirable and undesirable objects.
Further, the one who is established in Brahman-
5.21 With the self unattached to external contacts he finds happiness in the Self; with the self engaged in    the meditation of Brahman he attains to the endless happiness.
5.21 He finds happiness in his own Self, and enjoys eternal bliss, whose heart does not yearn for the contacts of earth and whose Self is one with the Everlasting.
5.21. The enjoyments that are born of contacts [with objects] are indeed nothing but sources of misery and have beginning and end.  [Hence], an intelligent man does not get delighted in them, O son of Kunti !
5.21 He whose mind is detached from external contact, and finds happiness in the self - he has his mind engaged in the contemplation of Brahman and he enjoys undecaying bliss.
5.21 With his heart unattached to external objects, he gets the bliss that is in the Self. With his heart absorbed in meditation on Brahman, he acires undecaying Bliss.
5.21 He who finds happiness in the self within himself, his mind detached from external contact in the manner already mentioned, i.e., from experience of objects other than the self - such a person abandoning the contemplation on Prakrti or bodily experiences, has his mind engaged in the contemplation on Brahman i.e., the Atman. Thus he attains everlasting bliss which consists in the experience of Brahman (the self).

Sri Krsna speaks of the abandonment of material pleasure as easy:
5.21 He,  in whom there is no desire  for the external  touch viz.,  the object-he  thinks says as  follows the Bhagawat -
5.21 Asakta-atma, with his heart, internal organ, unattached, bahya-sparsesu, to external objects-sparsah means objects that are contacted, viz sound etc.; bahya-sparsah means those things which are external (bahya) and are objects of contact; that person who thus has his heart unattached, who derives no happiness from objects; he vindati, gets that sukham, bliss; yat, which is; atmani, in the Self. Brahma-yoga-yukta-atma, with his heart absorbed in meditation on Brahman-meditation (yoga) on Brahman is brahma-yoga; one whose internal organ (atma) is absorbed in (yukta), engaged in, that meditation on Brahman is brahma-yoga-yukta-atma; he asnute, acires; aksayam, undecaying; sukham, Bliss.
So, he who cherishes undecaying happiness in the Self should withdraw the organs from the momentary happiness in external objects. This is the meaning.
For this reason also one should withdraw:
5.22 The enjoyments that are born of contacts are only generators of pain, for they have a beginning and an end, O Arjuna; the wise man does not rejoice in them.
5.22 The joys that spring from external associations bring pain; they have their beginning and their endings. The wise man does not rejoice in them.
5.22. Whosoever, right here, before abandoning the body, is capable of bearing the force sprung from desire and wrath-he is considered to be a man of Yoga and a happy man.
5.22 For those pleasures that are born of contact are wombs or pain. They have a beginning and an end, O Arjuna. The wise do not rejoice in them.
5.22 Since enjoyments that result from contact (with objects) are verily the sources of sorrow and have a beginning and an end, (therefore) O son of Kunti, the wise one does not delight in them.
5.22 Those pleasures which result from the contact of sense objects with the senses, are the wombs of pain, i.e., have pain as their ultimate fruit 'They have a beginning and an end,' i.e., they are seen to remain only for a brief period and the reaction that follows their cessation is painful. He who knows what they themselves are, i.e., know themselves as Atman, will not find pleasure in them.
5.22 Ye hi  etc.  He considers  indeed as follows :  'All enjoyments born  of the external  objects are in the form of causes of misery;  and even otherwise , they are impermanent'.
5.22 Hi, since; bhogah, enjoyments; ye samsparsajah, that result from contact with objects, that arise from contact between the objects and the organs; are eva, verily; duhkha-yonayah, sources of sorrow, because they are creations of ignorance. It is certainly a matter of experience that physical and other sorrows are created by that itself. By the use of the word eva (verily), it is understood that, as it happens here in this world, so does it even in the other world. Realizing that there is not the least trace of happiness in the world, one should withdraw the organs from the objects which are comparable to a mirage.
Not only are they sources of sorrow, they also adi-antavantah, have a beginning and an end. Adi (beginning) of enjoyments consists in the contact between objects and senses, and their end (anta), indeed, is the loss of that contact. Hence, they have a beginning and an end, they are impermanent, being present in the intervening moment. This is the meaning. (Therefore) O son of Kunti, budhah, the wise one, the discriminating person who has realized the Reality which is the supreme Goal; na ramate, does not delight; tesu, in them, in enjoyments. For delight in objects is seen only in very foolish beings, as for instance in animals etc.
This extremely painful evil, which is opposed to the path of Bliss and is the source of getting all miseries, is difficult to resist. Therefore one must make the utmost effort to avoid it. Hence the Lord says:;
5.23 He who is able, while still here (in this world) to withstand, before the liberation from the body, the impulse born out of desire and anger  he is a Yogi, he is a happy man.
5.23 He who, before he leaves his body, learns to surmount the promptings of desire and anger is a saint and is happy.
5.23. He, whose pleasure, delight and again light are just within-O son of Prtha !  he attains the supreme Yoga, himself becoming the Brahman.
5.23 He who is able, even here, before he is released from the body, to bear the impulse generated by desire and wrath, he is a Yogin (competent for self-realisation); he is the happy man.
5.23 One who can withstand here itself-before departing from the body-the impulse arising from desire and anger, that man is a yogi; he is happy.
5.23 When a man is able to withstand, i.e., to control the impulses of emotions like desire and anger by his longing for the experience of self, he is released 'here itself from the body,' i.e., even during the state when he is practising the means for release, he gains the capacity for experiencing the self. But he becomes blessed by the experience and gets immersed in the bliss of the self only after the fall of the body (at the end of his Prarabdha or operative Karma). [The implication is that in this system there is no Jivan-Mukti or complete liberation even when the body is alive. Only the state of Sthita-prajna or of 'one of steady wisdom' can be attained by an embodied Jiva.]
5.23 Saknoti etc.  It is  not easy to accomplish this;  [for], if this force of wrath and desire, hard to bear is endured till the last moment of the body, not for a moment alone-then is the total Bliss achievement.
5.23 Yah saknoti, one who can, is able to; sodhum, withstand; iha eva, here itself, while alive; prak, before; sarira-vimoksanat, departing from the body, till death-. Death is put as a limit because the impulse of desire and anger is certanily inevitable for a living person. For this impulse has got infinite sources. One should not relax until his death. That is the idea.
Kama, desire, is the hankering, thirst, with regard to a coveted object-of an earlier experience, and which is a source of pleasure-when it comes within the range of the senses, or is heard of or remembered. And krodha, anger, is that repulsion one has against what are adverse to oneself and are sources of sorrow, when they are seen, heard of or remembered. That impulse (veda) which has those desire and anger as its source (udbhava) is kama-krodha-udbhava-vegah. The impulse arising from desire is a kind of mental agitation, and has the signs of horripilation, joyful eyes, face, etc. The impulse of anger has the signs of trembling of body, perspiration, bitting of lips, red eyes, etc. He who is able to withstand that impulse arising from desire and anger, sah narah, that man; is yuktah, a yogi; and sukhi, is happy, in this world.
What kind of a person, being established in Brahman, attains Brahman? The Lord says:
5.24 He who is happy within, who rejoices within, and who is illuminated within, that Yogi attains absolute freedom or Moksha, himself becoming Brahman.
5.24 He who is happy within his Self and has found Its peace, and in whom the inner light shines, that sage attains Eternal Bliss and becomes the Spirit Itself.
5.24. The seers, whose dirts have decayed; by whom dualities have been out off;  whose self (mind) is controlled;  and who are delighted in the welfare of all; they gain the Brahman, the Tranil One.
5.24 He whose  joy is within, pleasure is within, and similarly light is within - he is a Yogin, who having become the Brahman, attains the bliss of the Brahman.
5.24 One who is happy within, whose pleasure is within, and who has his light only within, that yogi, having become Brahman, attains absorption in Brahman.
5.24 He who, renouncing all the experiences of outside objects, 'finds joy within,' i.e., finds his sole joy in experiencing the self; 'who has his pleasure within,' i.e., whose pleasure-garden is the self; and with regard to whom the self increases his happiness by Its own alities like bliss, knowledge, sinlessness, etc.; 'whose light is within,' i.e., who lives, directing his knowledge solely on the self - a person of such a description is the Yogin, who 'having become the Brahman (the self), attains the bliss of the Brahman' i.e., the bliss of experiencing the self.
5.24
Yo'ntah etc :  Within :  For him there is happiness nowhere but within and it does  not  depend on any external object ;  there alone he rejoices;  his lustre is there only.  But,  there is an apparent ignorance  [of him] in his worldly  dealings.  That has been said as -
 
'[A man of  realisation]  would  wander, like a fool, 
with no inclination for discussion.'  (PS, 71)
5.24 Yah antah-sukhah, one who is happy within, in the indwelling Self; and so also antar-aramah, has pleasure within-he disports only in the Self within; similarly, antar-jyotih eva, has his light only within, has the indwelling Self alone as his light; [He has not to depend on the organs like ear etc. for aciring knowledge.] sah yogi, that yogi; yah, who is of this kind; brahma-bhutah, having become Brahman, even while he is still living; adhigacchati, attains; brahma-nirvanam, absorption in Brahman-gets Liberation.
Besides,
5.25 The sages (Rishis) obtain absolute freedom or Moksha  they whose sins have been destroyed, whose dualities (perception of dualities or experience of the pairs of opposites) are torn asunder, who are self-controlled, and intent on the welfare of all beings.
5.25 Sages whose sins have been washed away, whose sense of separateness has vanished, who have subdued themselves, and seek only the welfare of all, come to the Eternal Spirit.
5.25. At all times there is the tranil Brahman for the ascetics who have severed their connection with desire and anger, who have controlled their mind and have realised their Self.
5.25 The sages who are free from the pairs of opposites, whose minds are well subdued and who are devoted to the welfare of all beings, become cleansed of all impurities and attain the bliss of the Brahman.
5.25 The seers whose sins have been attenuated, who are freed from doubt, whose organs are under control, who are engaged in doing good to all beings, attain absorption in Brahman.
5.25 The sages are seers who are devoted to the vision of the self. For them the pairs of opposites are annulled; i.e., they are freed from pairs of opposites like cold and heat, etc. 'They have their minds well subdued,' i.e., their minds are directed to the self. 'They are devoted to the welfare of all beings,' i.e., they are interested in the welfare of all beings like their own selves. Those persons who are like this have all their impurities, which are incompatible with the attainment of the self, annulled, and they attain to the bliss of the Brahman.

For those possessing the characteristics mentioned above, Sri Krsna now teaches that the Brahman is easy to attain.
5.25 Labhante etc.  This  [goal] is however possible to attain for those in whom the double knots in the form of dualism and doubt have been cut off.
5.25 Rsayah, the seers, those who have full realization, the monks; ksina-kalmasah, whose sins, defects like sin etc., have been attenuated; chinna-dvaidhah, who are freed from doubt; yata-atmanah, whose organs are under control; ratah, who are engaged; sarvabhutahite, in doing good to all beings-favourably disposed towards all, i.e. harmless; labhante, attain; brahma-nirvanam, absorption in Brahman, Liberation.
Further,
5.26 Absolute freedom (or Brahmic bliss) exists on all sides for those self-controlled ascetics who are free from desire and anger, who have controlled their thoughts and who have realised the Self.
5.26 Saints who know their Selves, who control their minds, and feel neither desire nor anger, find Eternal Bliss everywhere.
5.26. Warding  off the external contacts outside; making the sense of sight in the middle of the two wandering ones; counter-balancing both the  forward and backward moving forces that travel within what acts crookedly;
5.26 To those who are free from desire and wrath, who are wont to exert themselves, whose thought is controlled, and who have conered it - the beatitude of the Brahman is close at hand.
5.26 To the monks who have control over their internal organ, who are free from desire and anger, who have known the Self, there is absorption in Brahman either way.
5.26 To those who are free from desire and wrath; 'who are wont to exert themselves' i.e., who are practising self-control; whose 'thought is controlled,' i.e., whose minds are subdued; 'who have conered them,' i.e., whose minds are under their control - to such persons the beatitude of the Brahman is close at hand. The beatitude of the Brahman is already in hand to persons of this type.

Sri Krsna concludes the examination of Karma Yoga already stated, as reaching the highest point in the practice of mental concentration (Yoga) having for its object the vision of the self:
5.26 Kama - etc.  For them at all times i.e.,  at all stages, there is  Brahman-Existence, the ultimately true one,  and it does not look for the time of control  [of the mind (mediation)]
5.26 Yatinam, to the monks; yata-cetasam, who have control over their internal organ; kama-krodha-viyuktanam, who are free from desire and anger; vidita-atmanam, who have known the Self, i.e. who have full realization; vartate, there is; brahma-nir-vanam, absorption in Brahman, Liberation; abhitah, either way, whether living or dead.
Immediate Liberation of the monks who are steadfast in full realization has been stated. And the Lord has said, and will say, at every stage that Karma-yoga, undertaken as a dedication to Brahman, to God, by surrendering all activities [The activities of body, mind and organs] to God, leads to Liberation through the stages of purification of the heart, attainment of Knowledge, and renunciation of all actions. Thereafter, now, with the idea, 'I shall speak elaborately of the yoga of meditation which is the proximate discipline for full realization,' the Lord gave instruction through some verses in the form of aphorisms:
5.27 Shutting out (all) external contacts and fixing the gaze between the eyrow, ealising the outgoing and incoming breaths moving within the nostrils.
5.27 Excluding external objects, his gaze fixed between the eyebrows, the inward and outward breathings passing equally through his nostrils;
5.27. The sage, who has controlled his sense-organs, mind and intellect; whose chief aim is emancipation; and from whom desire, fear and wrath have departed-he remains just free always.
5.27 Shutting off outward contacts, fixing the gaze between the eye-brows, ealising inward and outward breaths moving in the nostrils;
5.27-5.28 Keeping the external objects outside, the eyes at the juncture of the eye-brows, and making eal the outgoing and incoming breaths that move through the nostrils, the contemplative who has control over his organs, mind and intellect should be fully intent on Liberation and free from desire, fear and anger. He who is ever is verily free.
5.27 - 5.28 'Shutting off all contact with outside objects,' i.e., stopping the outward functioning of the senses; seated with his trunk straightened in a posture fit for meditation (Yoga); 'fixing the gaze between the eye-brows,' i.e., at the root of the nose where the eye-brows meet; 'ealising inward and outward breaths,' i.e., making exhalatory and inhalatory breath move eally:  making the senses, Manas and intellect no longer capable of anything except the vision of the self, conseently being free from 'desire, fear and wrath'; 'who is intent on release as his final goal,' i.e., having release as his only aim - the sage who is thus intent on the vision of the self 'is indeed liberated for ever,' i.e., he is almost a liberated person, as he would soon be in the ultimate stage of fruition.

Sri Krsna now says that Karma Yoga, described above, which is facilitated by the performance of obligatory and occasional rites and which culminates in meditation (Yoga), is easy to practise:
5.27 See Comment under 5.28
5.27 Krtva, keeping; bahyan, the external; sparsan, objects-sound etc.; bahih, outside: To one who does not pay attention to the external objects like sound etc., brought to the intellect through the ear etc., the objects become verily kept outside. Having kept them out in this way, and (keeping) the caksuh, eyes; antare, at the juncture; bhruvoh, of the eye-brows (-the word 'keeping' has to be supplied-); and similarly, samau krtva, making eal; prana-apanau, the outgoing and the incoming breaths; nasa-abhyantara-carinau, that move through the nostrils; munih, the contemplative-derived (from the root man) in the sense of contemplating-, the monk; yata-indriya-mano-buddhih, who has control over his organs, mind and intellect; should be moksa-para-yanah, fully intent on Liberation-keeping his body is such a posture, the contemplative should have Liberation itself as the supreme Goal. He should be vigata-iccha-bhaya-krodhah, free from desire, fear and anger. The monk yah, who; sada, ever remains thus; sah, he; is muktah yah, who;sada, ever remains thus; sah, he; is muktah, ever, verily free. He has no other Liberation to seek after.
What is there to be realized by one who has his mind thus concentrated? The answer this is beig stated:
5.28 With the senses, the mind and the intellect (ever) controlled, having liberation as his supreme goal, free from desire, fear and anger  the sage is verily liberated for ever.
5.28 Governing sense, mind and intellect, intent on liberation, free from desire, fear and anger, the sage is forever free.
5.28. Having known Me as the Enjoyer of  [the fruits of]  sacrifices and austerties, as the great Lord of all the worlds, and as the Friend of all beings, he (the man of Yoga) attains peace.
5.28 The sage who has controlled his senses, mind and intellect, who is intent on release as his final goal, freed for ever from desire, fear and wrath - is indeed liberated forever.
5.27-5.28 Keeping the external objects outside, the eyes at the juncture of the eye-brows, and making eal the outgoing and incoming breaths that move through the nostrils, the contemplative who has control over his organs, mind and intellect should be fully intent on Liberation and free from desire, fear and anger. He who is ever is verily free.
5.27 - 5.28 'Shutting off all contact with outside objects,' i.e., stopping the outward functioning of the senses; seated with his trunk straightened in a posture fit for meditation (Yoga); 'fixing the gaze between the eye-brows,' i.e., at the root of the nose where the eye-brows meet; 'ealising inward and outward breaths,' i.e., making exhalatory and inhalatory breath move eally:  making the senses, Manas and intellect no longer capable of anything except the vision of the self, conseently being free from 'desire, fear and wrath'; 'who is intent on release as his final goal,' i.e., having release as his only aim - the sage who is thus intent on the vision of the self 'is indeed liberated for ever,' i.e., he is almost a liberated person, as he would soon be in the ultimate stage of fruition.

Sri Krsna now says that Karma Yoga, described above, which is facilitated by the performance of obligatory and occasional rites and which culminates in meditation (Yoga), is easy to practise:
5.27-28 Sparsan etc.;  Yatendriya-etc. Warding  off outside,  i.e.,  not accepting, the external contacts (objects);  establishing all the sense-organs - indicated by  'sense of  sight' - in the middle place in between the two wandering ones, i.e.,  the right and the left views in the form of desire and wrath  viz., in that particular place which is free from both these;  he would remain fixing  in eipoise  (or making neutral)  both the forward  (upward) and  backward  (downward)  moving forces  viz., the pious and impious acts,  within the mental modification.  Nasa  'that  which acts crookedly'.  This is mental modification,  because it behaves crookedly i.e.,  ineally due to  anger etc.  The same is in the external plane.  A man of Yoga  of  this type is just free, though he transacts all mundane business.
5.28 Krtva, keeping; bahyan, the external; sparsan, objects-sound etc.; bahih, outside: To one who does not pay attention to the external objects like sound etc., brought to the intellect through the ear etc., the objects become verily kept outside. Having kept them out in this way, and (keeping) the caksuh, eyes; antare, at the juncture; bhruvoh, of the eye-brows (-the word 'keeping' has to be supplied-); and similarly, samau krtva, making eal; prana-apanau, the outgoing and the incoming breaths; nasa-abhyantara-carinau, that move through the nostrils; munih, the contemplative-derived (from the root man) in the sense of contemplating-, the monk; yata-indriya-mano-buddhih, who has control over his organs, mind and intellect; should be moksa-para-yanah, fully intent on Liberation-keeping his body is such a posture, the contemplative should have Liberation itself as the supreme Goal. He should be vigata-iccha-bhaya-krodhah, free from desire, fear and anger. The monk yah, who; sada, ever remains thus; sah, he; is muktah yah, who;sada, ever remains thus; sah, he; is muktah, ever, verily free. He has no other Liberation to seek after.
What is there to be realized by one who has his mind thus concentrated? The answer this is beig stated:
5.29 He who knows Me as the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities, the great Lord of all the worlds and the friend of all beings, attains to peace.
5.29 Knowing me as Him who gladly receives all offerings of austerity and sacrifice, as the Might Ruler of all the Worlds and the Friend of all beings, he passes to Eternal Peace."
5.29. There is no such translation for this sloka.
5.29 Knowing Me as the enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities, as the Supreme Lord of all the worlds, as the Friend of every being, he attains peace.
5.29 One attains Peace by knowing Me who, as the great Lord of all the worlds, am the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities, (and) who am the friend of all creatures.
5.29 Knowing Me as the enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities, as the Supreme Lord of all the worlds, and as the Friend of every being, he attains peace, i.e., wins happiness even while performing Karma Yoga. 'Him who is the Supreme Lord of all worlds' means 'Him who is the Lord of all the lords of the worlds.' For the Sruti says: 'Him who is the supreme mighty Lord of lords' (Sve. U., 6.7). The meaning is that knowing Me as the Supreme Lord of all the worlds and the 'friend' of all and considering Karma Yoga to be My worship, he becomes gladly engaged in it. All beings endeavour to please a 'friend'.
5.29  Bhokatram  etc. [The Lord is deemed to be] the enjoyer in the caste of their fruit of the sacrifices.  For, it is in favour of Him that the fruit is renounced.  the same is with regard to the austerities.  By knowing the nautre of the Lord as such, a man of Yoga is released, whatever way he may remain in.
5.29 Rcchati, one attains; santim, Peace, complete cessation of transmigration; jnatva, by knowing; mam, Me who am Narayana; who, as the sarva-loka-mahesvaram, great Lord of all the worlds; am the bhoktaram, enjoyer (of the fruits); yajna-tapasam, of sacrifices and austerities, as the performer and the Deity of the sacrifices and austerities (respectively); (and) who am the suhrdam, friend; sarva-bhutanam, of all creatures-who am the Benefactor of all without consideration of return, who exist in the heart of all beings, who am the dispenser of the results of all works, who am the Witness of all perceptions.
5.3 He should be known as a perpertual Sannyasi who neither hates nor desires; for, free from the pairs of opposites, O mighty-armed Arjuna, he is easily set free from bondage.
5.3 He is a true ascetic who never desires or dislikes, who is uninfluenced by the opposites and is easily freed from bondage.
5.3. That person may be considered a man of permanent renunciation, who neither hates nor desires.  For, O mighty-armed !  he who is free from the pairs [of opposites] is easily released from bondage [of action].
5.3 He who neither hates nor desires and is beyond the pairs of opposites is to be understood as an ever-renouncer. Hence, he is easily set free from bondage, O Arjuna.
5.3 He who does not hate and does not crave should be known as a man of constant renunciation.
5.3 That Karma Yogin, who, being satisfied with the experience of the self implied in Karma Yoga, does not desire anything different therefrom and conseently does not hate anything, and who, because of this, resignedly endures the pairs of opposites - he should be understood as ever given to renunciation, i.e., even devoted to Jnana Yoga. Such a one therefore is freed from bondage because of his being firmly devoted to Karma Yoga which is easy to practise.

The independence of Jnana Yoga and Karma Yoga from each other as means for attainment of the self is now declared.
5.3 Jneyah etc.  Therefore he  alone is all the time man-of-renunciation, by whom both desire and hatred have been renounced from his mind.  Because his intellect has come out of the pairs of  anger,  delusion and others, he is released just easily.
5.3 For, O mighty-armed one, he who is free from duality becomes easily freed from bondage.
That performer of Karma-yoga, yah, who; na dvesti, does not hate anything; and na kanksati, does not crave; jneyah, should be known; as nitya-sannyasi, a man of constant [A man of constant renunciation: He is a man of renunciation ever before the realization of the actionless Self.] renunciation. The meaning is that he who continues to be like this in the midst of sorrow, happiness and their sources should be known as a man of constant renunciation, even though engaged in actions.
Hi, for; mahabaho, O mighty-armed one; nirdvandvah, one who is free from duality; pramucyate, becomes freed; sukham, easily, without trouble; bandhat, from bondage.
It is reasonable that in the case of renunciation and Karma-yoga, which are opposed to each other and can be undertaken by different persons, there should be opposition even between their results; but it canot be that both of them surely lead to Liberation. When such a estion arises, this is the answer stated:
5.4 Children, not the wise, speak of knowledge and the Yoga of action or the performance of action as though they are distinct and different; he who is truly established in one obtains the fruits of both.
5.4 Only the unenlightened speak of wisdom and right action as separate, not the wise. If any man knows one, he enjoys the fruit of both.
5.4. The childish,  and not the wise,  proclaim the paths of knowledge and the Yoga as different.  He, who has properly resorted to even one [of these two], gets the fruit of both.
5.4 Children, not the learned, speak of Sankhya (Jnana Yoga) and Yoga (Karma Yoga) as distinct; he who is firmly set in one, attans the fruit of both.
5.4 The fools, not the learned ones, speak of Sankhya (the path of Knowledge) and (Karma-) yoga as different. Any one who properly resorts to even one (of them) gets the result of both.
5.4 Those who say that Karma Yoga and Jnana Yoga are distinct because of the difference in results, are children, i.e., are persons with incomplete knowledge; they do not know the entire truth. The meaning is that they do not possess true knowledge, who say that Karma Yoga results in Jnana Yoga only and that Jnana Yoga alone results in the vision of the self and that the two are thus distinct because of the difference in their fruits. But on the contrary as both have only the vision of the self as the fruit, a person who is firmly set in one of them, wins that one fruit common to both.

Sri Krsna further expounds the same:
5.4 See Comment under 5.5
5.4 Balah, the fools; na panditah, not the learned ones; pravadanti, speak of; sankhya-yogau, Sankhya [Sankhya, i.e. monasticism, is that which is suited for sankhya, Self-iniry.] (the Path of Knowledge) and (Karma-)yoga; as prthak, different, having opposite and different results. The learned ones, the wise, however, admit one, unconflicting result. How? Any one who samyak, properly; asthitah, resorts to, i.e. follows; ekam api, even one, between the Path of Knowledge and (Karma-) yoga; vindate, gets; phalam, the result; ubhayoh, of both. For, the result of both is that Liberation itself. Therefore there is no conflict with regard to the result.
Objection: After beginning the topic with the words, 'renunciation' and '(Karma-) yoga', how is it that the Lord speaks of the identity of the results of the path of Knowledge and (Karma-) yoga, which is beside the point?
Reply: This defect does not arise. Although the estion was put by Arjuna merely with regard to renunciation and Karma-yoga, yet the Lord, without actually avoiding them, and by adding something special which was intended by Him, gave the answer by expressing them through other words, 'Sankhya' and '(Karma-) yoga'. Those very 'renunciation and 'Karma-yoga', when they are (respectively) associated with Knowledge and such of Its means as eanimity etc., are meant by the words 'Sankhya' and 'yoga'. This is the Lord's veiw. Therefore there is no discussion out of the context.
How can the result of both be attained by the proper performance of only one? The answer is:
5.5 That place which is reached by the Sankhyas or the Jnanis is reached by the Yogis (Karma Yogis). He sees, who sees knowledge and the performance of action (Karma Yoga) as one.
5.5 The level which is reached by wisdom is attained through right action as well. He who perceives that the two are one, knows the truth.
5.5. What state is reached by men of knowledge-path the same is reached by men of Yoga subseently.  [So] whosoever sees the knowledge-path and the Yoga to be one, he sees [correctly].
5.5 That state which is reached by the Sankhyans, the same is reached by the Yogins, i.e., the same state is attained also by those who are Karma Yogins. He alone is wise who sees that the Sankhya and the Yoga are one and the same because of their having the same result.
5.5 The State [Sthana (State) is used in the derivative sense of 'the place in which one remains established, and from which one does not become relegated'.] that is reached by the Sankhyas, that is reached by the yogis as well. He sees who sees Sankhya and yoga as one.
5.5 The fruit in the form of the vision of the self which is attained by the Sankhyans (i.e.) Jnana Yogins, the same is attained alone by those who are Karma Yogins. He alone is wise who sees that Sankhya and the Yoga are one and the same because of their having the same result.

Sri Krsna points out, if the aforesaid is the case, wherein the difference between them lies.
5.4-5 Samkhya-Yogau etc. Yat  samkhyaih etc.  There is nothing  to differentiate as  'This is path of knowledge'  [and]  'This is Yoga'.  Indeed both these are ever inter-connected.  Knowledge is not without Yoga;  and Yoga also is not without  knowledge.  Hence the identity of these two.
5.5 Sthanam, the State called Liberation; yat prapyate, that is reached; sankhyaih, by the Sankhyas, by the monks steadfast in Knowledge; tat prapyate, that is reached; yogaih, by the yogis; api, as well. The yogis are those who, as a means to the attainment of Knowledge, undertake actions by dedicating them to God without seeking any result for themselves. The purport is that, by them also that Stated is reached through the process of aciring monasticism which is a result of the knowledge of the supreme Reality.
Therefore, sah, he; pasyati, sees truly; yah, who; pasyati, sees; Sankhya and yoga as ekam, one, because of the identity of their results. This is the meaning.
Objection: If this be so, then monasticism itself excels yoga! Why, then, is it said, 'Among the two, Karma-yoga, however, excels renunciation of actions'?
Reply: Hear the reason for this: Having is veiw the mere giving up of actions and Karma-yoga, your estion was as to which one was better of the two. My answer was accordingly given that Karma-yoga excels renunciation of actions (resorted to) without Knowledge is Sankhya. This is what was meant by me. And that is indeed yoga in the highest sense. However, that which is the Vedic Karma-yoga is figuratively spoken of as yoga and renunciation since it leads to it (supreme Knowledge).
How does it lead to that? The answer is:
5.6 But renunciation, O mighty-armed Arjuna, is hard to attain without Yoga; the Yoga-harmonised sage ickly goes to Brahman.
5.6 Without concentration, O Mighty Man, renunciation is difficult. But the sage who is always meditating on the Divine, before long shall attain the Absolute.
5.6. O mighty-armed (Arjuna) !  Renunciation is certainly hard to attain excepting through Yoga; the sage who is the master of Yoga attains the Brahman, before long.
5.6 But renunciation, O mighty-armed, is hard to attain without (following) Yoga. The contemplating sage who follows Yoga reaches the Brahman (the self or Atman) soon.
5.6 But, O mighty-armed one, renunciation is hard to attain without (Karma-) yoga. The meditative man eipped with yoga attains Brahman without delay.
5.6 Renunciation, i.e., Jnana Yoga, cannot be attained without Yoga, i.e., Karma Yoga. A person following Yoga, i.e., following Karma Yoga, being himself a Muni, i.e., one engaged in the contemplation of self, after practising Karma Yoga reaches with ease the Brahman i.e., attains the self soon, i.e., in a short time. But one following Jnana Yoga by itself, completes Jnana Yoga with great difficulty only. On account of this great difficulty, he attains the self after a long period only.
5.6 Samnyasastu etc.  [Here] the word tu is used in the sense of   'affirmation'  and it is to be construed in a different order.  [Hence the meaning is] :  For a person without Yoga, it is certainly hard to attain renunciation.  Because, as it has been already shown logically, it is difficult  to renounce actions.  But, it is certainly easy for men of Yoga to attain this.  That has been said earlier.
5.6 Tu, but, O mighty-armed one; sannyasah, renunciation, in the real sense; duhkham aptum, is hard to attain; ayogatah, without (Karma-) yoga. Munih, the meditative man-the word muni being derived in the sense of one who meditates on the real nature of God; yoga-yuktah, eipped with yoga, with Vedic Karma-yoga in the form of dedication to God without thought of results (for oneself); adhigacchati, attains; brahma, Brahman; na cirena, without delay, very ickly. Therefore it was said by Me, 'Karma-yoga excels'. [Karma-yoga leads to enlightenment through the stages of attenuation of attachment, withdrawal of the internal and external organs from their objects, and their inclination towards the indwelling Self. (Also see Commentary on 5.12).]
The monasticism under discussion is called Brahman because it leads to knowledge of the supreme Self, as stated in the Upanisad, 'Nyasa (monasticism) is Brahman. Brahman is verily the supreme' (Ma. Na. 21.2) Brahman means monasticism in the real sense, consisting in steadfastness to the knowledge of the supreme Self.
5.7 He who is devoted to the path of action, whose mind is ite pure, who has conered the self, who has subdued his senses and who realises his Self as the Self in all beings, though acting, is not tainted.
5.7 He who is spiritual, who is pure, who has overcome his senses and his personal self, who has realised his highest Self as the Self of all, such a one, even though he acts, is not bound by his acts.
5.7. A master of Yoga, whose self (mind and intellect) is very pure and is fully subdued, the sense-organs controlled, and Soul is [realised to be] the Soul of all beings-he is not stained, eventhough he is a performer [of actions].
5.7 He who follows the Yoga and is pure in self (mind), who has subdued his self and has conered his senses and whose self has become the self of all beings, even while he is acting, he is untainted.
5.7 Endowed with yoga, [i.e. devoted to the performance of the nitya and naimittika duties.] pure in mind, controlled in body, a coneror of the organs, the Self of the selves of all beings-he does not become tainted even while performing actions. [The construction of the sentence is this: When this person resorts to nitya and naimittika rites and duties as a means to the achievement of fully Illumination, and thus becomes fully enlightened, then, even when he acts through the apparent functions of the mind, organs, etc., he does not become afflected.]
5.7 But a Karma Yogin remains engaged in the performance of pure actions prescribed by the Sastras, which are of the nature of propitiation of the Supreme Person. By this, he becomes purified in mind. He thus subdues his self, i.e., subdues his mind easily, because his mind is engaged in the virtuous actions he has been performing before. Therefore his senses are subdued. His self is said to have become the self of all beings. Because of his being devoted to contemplation on the true nature of the self, he finds that his self is similar to the self of all beings like gods etc. One who contemplates on the true nature of the self understands that all selves are of the same form or nature. The distinctions obtaining among gods, men etc., cannot pertain to the form of the self, because those distinctions are founded on particular modifications of Prakrti i.e., the bodies of beings. Sri Krsna will teach:  'For the Brahman (an individual self), when untainted, is the same everywhere' (5.19). The meaning of this is that when dissociated from the Prakriti, i.e., the body, the self is of the same nature everywhere, i.e., in the bodies of gods, men etc. It is of the same form of knowledge. The meaning is that one, who has become enlightened in this way, active though he be, is not tainted on account of erroneously conceiving what is other than the self (the body) as the self. He is not at all associated therewith. Therefore, he attains the self without any delay.

As Karma Yoga is superior to Jnana Yoga because it is more easily pursued and is more rapidly efficacious in securing the fruits, listen to its reirement:
5৷৷7 See Comment under 5.11
5.7 When again, as a means to attain full enlightenment, this person becomes yoga-yuktah, endowed with yoga; visuddhatma, pure in mind; vijitatma, controlled in body; jitendriyah, a coneror of the organs; and sarva-bhutatma-bhutatma, the Self of the selves of all beings-one whose Self (atma), the inmost consciousness, has become the selves (atma) of all beings (sarva-bhuta) beginning from Brahma to a clump of grass-, i.e., fully illumined; (then,) thus continuing in that state, he na lipyate, does not become tainted; kurvan api, even while performing actions for preventing mankind from going astray. That is to say, he does not become bound by actions.
And besides, this person does not act in the real sense. Hence,
5.8 "I do nothing at all," thus would the harmonised knower of Truth think  seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, going, sleeping, breathing.
5.8 Though the saint sees, hears, touches, smells, eats, moves, sleeps and breathes, yet he knows the Truth, and he knows that it is not he who acts.
5.8. A master of Yoga,  knowing the reality would think 'I do not perform any action at all'.  For, he who, while seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, going, sleeping and breathing;
5.8 The knower of the truth, who is devoted to Yoga should think, 'I do not at all do anything' even though he is seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleeping, breathing;
5.8-5.9 Remaining absorbed in the Self, the knower of Reality should think, 'I certainly do not do anything', even while seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleeping, breathing, speaking, releasing, holding, opening and closing the eyes-remembering that the organs function in relation to the objects of the organs.
5.8 - 5.9 Thus he who knows the truth concerning the self should reflect in mind that the ear and the other organs of sensation (Jnanendriyas) as also organs of action (Karmendriyas) and the vital currents (the Pranas) are occupied with their own respective objects. Thus he should know, 'I do not do anything at all.' He should reflect, 'My intrinsic nature is one of knowledge. The sense of agency comes because of the association of the self with the senses and the Pranas which are rooted in Karma. It does not spring from my essential nature.'
5.8 See Comment under 5.11
5.8 Yuktah, remaining absorbed in the Self; tattva-vit, the knower of Reality-knower of the real nature of Truth, of the Self, i.e., the seer of the supreme Reality; manyeta, should think; 'na karomi eva, I certainly do not do; kincit, anything.'
Having realized the Truth, when or how should he think? This is being answered; Api, even; pasyan, while seeing; srnvan, hearing; sprsan, touching; jighran, smelling; asnan, eating; gacchan, moving; svapan, sleeping; svasan, breathing; pralapan, speaking; visrjan, releasing; grhnan, holding; unmisan, opening; nimisan, closing the eyes. All these are to be connected with the above manyeta (should think).
For the man who has known the Truth thus, who finds nothing but inaction in action-in all the movements of the body and organs-, and who has full realization, there is competence only for giving up all actions because of his realization of the nonexistence of actions. Indeed, one who proceeds to drink water in a mirage thinking that water is there, surely does not go there itself for drinking water even after knowing that no water exists there!
5.9 Speaking, letting go, seizing, opening and closing the eyes  convinced that the senses move among the sense-objects.
5.9 Though he talks, though he gives and receives, though he opens his eyes and shuts them, he still knows that his senses are merely disporting themselves among the objects of perception.
5.9. Taking, rejecting, receiving, opening and closing the eyes, bears in mind that the sense-organs are on their respective objects; and
5.9 Speaking, discharging, grasping, opening, closing his eyes etc. He should always bear in mind that the senses operate among sense-objects.
5.8-5.9 Remaining absorbed in the Self, the knower of Reality should think, 'I certainly do not do anything', even while seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleeping, breathing, speaking, releasing, holding, opening and closing the eyes-remembering that the organs function in relation to the objects of the organs.
5.8 - 5.9 Thus he who knows the truth concerning the self should reflect in mind that the ear and the other organs of sensation (Jnanendriyas) as also organs of action (Karmendriyas) and the vital currents (the Pranas) are occupied with their own respective objects. Thus he should know, 'I do not do anything at all.' He should reflect, 'My intrinsic nature is one of knowledge. The sense of agency comes because of the association of the self with the senses and the Pranas which are rooted in Karma. It does not spring from my essential nature.'
5.9 See Comment under 5.11
5.9 Yuktah, remaining absorbed in the Self; tattva-vit, the knower of Reality-knower of the real nature of Truth, of the Self, i.e., the seer of the supreme Reality; manyeta, should think; 'na karomi eva, I certainly do not do; kincit, anything.'
Having realized the Truth, when or how should he think? This is being answered; Api, even; pasyan, while seeing; srnvan, hearing; sprsan, touching; jighran, smelling; asnan, eating; gacchan, moving; svapan, sleeping; svasan, breathing; pralapan, speaking; visrjan, releasing; grhnan, holding; unmisan, opening; nimisan, closing the eyes. All these are to be connected with the above manyeta (should think).
For the man who has known the Truth thus, who finds nothing but inaction in action-in all the movements of the body and organs-, and who has full realization, there is competence only for giving up all actions because of his realization of the nonexistence of actions. Indeed, one who proceeds to drink water in a mirage thinking that water is there, surely does not go there itself for drinking water even after knowing that no water exists there!
6.1 The Blessed Lord said  He who performs his bounden duty without depending on the fruits of his actions  he is a Sannyasi and a Yogi; not he who is without fire and without action.
6.1 "Lord Shri Krishna said: He who acts because it is his duty, not thinking of the consequences, is really spiritual and a true ascetic; and not he who merely observes rituals or who shuns all action.
6.1. The Bhagavat said  He who performs his bounden action, not depending on its fruit, in the man of renunciation and also the man of Yoga !  and not he, who remains [simply] without his fires and actions [is a Samnyasin or a Yogin]
6.1 The Lord said  He who performs works that ought to be done without seeking their fruits - he is a Sannyasin and Yogin, and not he who maintains no sacred fires and performs no actions.
6.1 The Blessed Lord said  He who performs an action which is his duty, without depending on the result of action, he is a monk and a yogi; (but) not (so in) he who does not keep a fire and is actionless.
6.1 The Lord said  He who, without depending on such fruits of works as heaven, etc., performs them, reflecting, 'The performance of works alone is my duty (Karya). Works themselves are my sole aim, because they are a form of worship of the Supreme Person who is our Friend in every way. There is nothing other than Him to be gained by them' - such a person is a Sannyasin, i.e., one devoted to Jnana Yoga, and also a Karma Yogin, i.e., one devoted to Karma Yoga. He is intent on both these, which is the means for attaining Yoga, which is of the nature of the vision of the self.

'And not he who maintains no sacred fires and performs no works,' i.e., not he who is disinclined to perform the enjoined works such as sacrifices, etc., nor he who is devoted to mere knowledge. The meaning is that such a person is devoted only to knowledge, whereas a person who is devoted to Karma Yoga has both knowledge and works.

Now Sri Krsna teaches that there is an element of knowledge in the Karma Yoga as defined above.
6.1 See Comment under 6.2
6.1 Anasritah, without depending on;-on what?-on that which is karma-phalam, the result of action- i.e. without craving for the result of action-. He who craves for the results of actions becomes dependent on the results of actions. But this person is the opposite of such a one. Hence (it is said), 'wihtout depending on the result of action.
Having become so, yah he who; karoti, performs accomplishes; (karma, an action;) which is his karyam, duty, the nityakarmas such as Agnihotra etc. which are opposed to the kamya-karmas-.
Whoever is a man of action of this kind is distinguished from the other men of action. In order to express this idea the Lord says, sah, he ; is a sannyasi, monk, and a yogi. Sanyyasa, means renunciation. he who is possessed of this is a sannyasi, a monk. And he is also a yogi. Yoga means concentration of mind. He who has that is a yogi. It is to be understood that this man is possessed of these alities. It is not to be understood that, only that person who does not keep a fire (niragnih) and who is actionless (akriyah) is a monk and a yogi. Niragnih is one from whom the fires [viz Garhapatya, Ahavaniya, Anvaharya-pacana, etc.], which are the accessories of rites, have bocome dissociated. By kriya are mean austerity, charity, etc. which are performed wityout fire.
Akriyah, actionless, is he who does not have even such kriyas.
Objection: Is it not only with regard to one who does not keep a fire and is acitonless that monasticsm and meditativeness are well known in the Vedas, Smrtis and scriptures dealing with meditation? Why are monasticism and meditativeness spoken of here with regard to one who keeps a fire and is a man of action-which is not accepted as a fact?
Reply: This defect does not arise, because both are sought to be asserted in some secondary sense.
Objection: How is that?
Reply: His being monk is by virtue of his having given up hankering for the results of actions; and his being a man of meditation is from the fact of his doing actions as accesories to meditation or from his rejection of thoughts for the results of actions which cause disturbances in the mind. Thus both are used in a figurative sense. On the contrary, it is not that monasticism and meditativeness are meant in the primary sense.
With a veiw to pointing out this idea, the Lord says:
6.10 Let the Yogi try constantly to keep the mind steady, remaining in solitude, alone, with the mind and the body controlled, and free from hope and covetousness.
6.10 Let the student of spirituality try unceasingly to concentrate his mind; Let him live in seclusion, absolutely alone, with mind and personality controlled, free from desire and without possessions.
6.10. Let the man of Yoga yoke always the self (mind) by remaining alone in a lonely place,  with his mind and self (body) controlled, without desire and without the sense of possession.
6.10 The Yogin should constantly fix his mind on Yoga, remaining in a solitary place all alone, controlling his thought and mind, free from desire and sense of possession.
6.10 A yogi should constantly concentrate his mind by staying in a solitary place, alone, with mind and body controlled, free from expectations, (and) free from acisition.
6.10 The Yogin who is steady in the practice of Karma Yoga, should 'constantly', i.e., daily when practising Yoga, fix his mind to the practice of Yoga, i.e., make himself engaged in the vision of the self. He must remain in a 'solitary place,' i.e., a place devoid of crowd and noise. And even there he must be 'all alone,' i.e., must not have a second person with him. He should 'control his thought and mind,' i.e., he should control the activities of thinking. He must be free from 'desire', i.e., he should not depend on anything except the self and be without the 'sense of possession,' without the idea of mineness with regard to anything other than the self.
6.10 See Comment under 6.15
6.10 A yogi, a man of meditation; satatam yunjita, should constantly concentrate; atmanam, his mind; sthitah, by staying; rahasi, in a solitary place, in mountain caves etc.; ekaki, alone, without any companion; yata-citta-atma, with mind and body controlled; nirasih, without expectations, free from hankering; and aparigrahah, free from acisition.
From the uise of the alifying words, 'in a solitary place' and 'alone', it follows that (he has to undertake all these) after espousing monasticism. And even after renunciation, he should concentrate his mind by desisting from all acisition. This is the meaning.
Now then have to be stated the rules regarding seat, food, movements, etc. as disciplines for yoga in the case of one practising concentration; as also the signs of one who has succeeded in Yoga, and the conseent result etc. Hence this is begun. Among these, the seat is being first spoken of:
6.11 In a clean spot, having established a firm seat of his own, neither too high nor too low, made of a cloth, a skin and Kusa-grass, one over the other.
6.11 Having chosen a holy place, let him sit in a firm posture on a seat, neither too high nor too low, and covered with a grass mat, a deer skin and a cloth.
6.11. Setting up in a clean place his own [suitable] firm seat which is predominantly of cloth, skin and kusa-grass,  and which,  is neither too high nor too low for him;
6.11 Having established for himself, in a clean spot, a firm seat, which is neither too hight nor too low, and covering it with cloth, deer-skin and Kusa grass in the reverse order -
6.11 Having firmly established in a clean place his seat, neither too high nor too low, and made of cloth, skin and kusa-grass, placed successively one below the other;
6.11 - 6.12 'In a clean spot,' i.e., in a spot pure in itself, not owned or controlled by impure persons and untouched by impure things; having 'established a firm seat,' a seat made of wood or similar material, which is neither too high nor too low; which is covered with cloth, deer-skin and Kusa grass in the reverse order; seated on it in a way which promotes the serenity of mind; having the mind concentrated on Yoga; and holding the activities of the mind and senses in check in all ways - he should practise 'Yoga', i.e., practise the vision of the self for 'the purification of the self,' i.e., to end his bondage.
6.11 See Comment under 6.15
6.11 See Commentary under 6.12
6.12 There, having made the mind one-pointed, with the actions of the mind and the senses controlled, let him, seated on the seat, practise Yoga for the purification of the self.
6.12 Seated thus, his mind concentrated, its functions controlled and his senses governed, let him practise meditation for the purification of his lower nature.
6.12. Sitting there on the seat and making the mind single-pointed, let him, with the activities of his mind and senses subdued, practise Yoga for self-purification.
6.12 There, sitting on the seat, with the mind concentrated and holding the mind and senses in check, he should practise Yoga for the purification of the self.
6.12 (and) sitting on that seat, he should concentrate his mind for the purification of the internal organ, making the mind one-pointed and keeping the actions of the mind and senses under control.
6.11 - 6.12 'In a clean spot,' i.e., in a spot pure in itself, not owned or controlled by impure persons and untouched by impure things; having 'established a firm seat,' a seat made of wood or similar material, which is neither too high nor too low; which is covered with cloth, deer-skin and Kusa grass in the reverse order; seated on it in a way which promotes the serenity of mind; having the mind concentrated on Yoga; and holding the activities of the mind and senses in check in all ways - he should practise 'Yoga', i.e., practise the vision of the self for 'the purification of the self,' i.e., to end his bondage.
6.12 See Comment under 6.15
6.12 Pratisthapya, having established; sthiram, firmly; sucau, in a clean; dese, place, which is solitary, either naturally or through improvement; atmanah, his own; asanam, seat; na ati ucchritam, neither too high; na ati nicam, nor even too low; and that made of caila-ajina-kusa-uttram, cloth, skin, and kusa-grass, placed successively one below the other-the successive arrangement of cloth etc. here is in a reverse order to that of the textual reading-.
What follows after thus establishing the seat? 
 
Upavisya, sitting; tatra, on that; asane, seat; yogam yunjyat, he should concentrate his mind. To what purpose should he concentrate his mind? In answer the Lord says: atma-visuddhaye, for the purification of the internal organ. How? Krtva, making; manah, the mind; ekagram, one-pointed,by withdrawing it from all objects; and yata-citta-indriya-kriyah, keeping the actions (kriyah) of the mind (citta) and senses (indriya) under control (yata).
The external seat has been spoken of. Now is being stated how the posture of the body should be:
6.13 Let him firmly hold his body, head and neck erect and still, gazing at the tip of his nose, without looking around.
6.13 Let him hold body, head and neck erect, motionless and steady; let him look fixedly at the tip of his nose, turning neither to the right nor to the left.
6.13. Holding the body, the head and the neck erect and motionless; remaining firm; looking properly at his own nose-tip; and not looking at [different] directions;
6.13 Holding the trunk, head and neck erect, motionless and steady, gazing at the tip of the nose, and looking not in any direction;
6.13 Holding the body, head and neck erect and still, being steady, looking at the tip of his own nose-and not looking around;
6.13 - 6.14 Keeping the trunk, head and neck erect and motionless; well seated in order to be steady; looking not in any direction but gazing at the tip of the nose; serene, i.e., holding the mind extremely peaceful; fearless; firm in the vow of celibacy; holding the mind in check; and fixing his thoughts on Me - he should sit in Yoga, i.e., remain concentrated and intent on Me, i.e., he should concentrating on Me only.
6.13 See Comment under 6.15
6.13 See Commentary under 6.14
6.14 Serene-minded, fearless, firm in the vow of a Brahmachari, having controlled the mind, thinking of Me and balanced in mind, let him sit, having Me as his supreme goal.
6.14 With peace in his heart and nor fear, observing the vow of celibacy, with mind controlled and fixed on Me, let the student lose himself in contemplation of Me.
6.14. Being calm-minded, fearless, firm in the vow of celibacy;  controlling mind fully; let  the master of Yoga remain, fixing his mind in Me and having Me [alone] as his supreme goal.
6.14 Serene and fearless, firm in the vow of celibacy, holding the mind in check and fixing the thought on Me, he should sit in Yoga, intent on Me.
6.14 He should remain seated with a placid mind, free from fear, firm in the vow of a celibate, and with the mind fixed on Me by controlling it through concentration, having Me as the supreme Goal.
6.13 - 6.14 Keeping the trunk, head and neck erect and motionless; well seated in order to be steady; looking not in any direction but gazing at the tip of the nose; serene, i.e., holding the mind extremely peaceful; fearless; firm in the vow of celibacy; holding the mind in check; and fixing his thoughts on Me - he should sit in Yoga, i.e., remain concentrated and intent on Me, i.e., he should concentrating on Me only.
6.14 See Comment under 6.15
6.14 Dharayan, holding; kaya-siro-girvam, the body (torso), head and neck; samam, erect; and acalam, still-movement is possible for one (even while) holding these erect; therefore it is specified, 'still'-; sthirah, being steady, i.e. remaining steady; sampreksya, looking svam nasikagram, at tip of his own nose -looking at it intently, as it were; ca, and; anavalokayan, not looking; disah, around, i.e. not glancing now and then in various directions-. The words 'as it were' are to be understood because what is intended here is not an injunction for looking at the tip of one's own nose! What then? It is the fixing the gaze of the eyes by withdrawing it from external objects; and that is enjoined with a veiw to concentrating the mind. [What is sought to be presented here as the primary objective is the concentration of mind. If the gaze be directed outward, then it will result in interrupting that concentration. Therefore the purpose is to first fix the gaze of the eyes within.] If the intention were merely the looking at the tip of the nose, then the mind would remain fixed there itself, not on the Self! In, 'Making the mind fixed in the Self' (25), the Lord will speak of concentrating the mind verily on the Self. Therefore, owing to the missing word iva (as it were), it is merely the withdrawl of the gaze that is implied by sampreksya (looking).
Further, prasantatma, with a placid mind, with a mind completely at peace; vigata-bhih, free from fear sthitah, firm; brahmacari-vrate, in the vow of a celibate, the vow cosisting in serivce of the teacher, eating food got by beggin, etc.-firm in that, i.e. he should follow these; besides, mat-cittah, with the mind fixed on Me who am the supreme God; samyamya, by controlling; manah, the mind, i.e. by stopping the modifications of the mind; yuktah, through concentration, i.e. by becoming concentrated; asita, he should remain seated; matparah, with Me as the supreme Goal. Some passionate person may have his mind on a woman, but he does not accept the woman as his supreme Goal. What then? He accepts the king or Sive as his goal. But this one (the yogi) not only has his mind on Me but has Me as his Goal.
After that, now is being stated the result of Yoga:
6.15 Thus always keeping the mind balanced, the Yogi, with the mind controlled, attains to the peace abiding in Me, which culminates in liberation.
6.15 Thus keeping his mind always in communion with Me, and with his thoughts subdued, he shall attain that Peace which is mine and which will lead him to liberation at last.
6.15. Yoking his self (mind) incessantly in this manner, My devotee, with mind not attached to anything else,  realises peace which culminates in the nirvana and is in the form of ending in Me.
6.15 Ever applying his mind in this way, the Yogin of controlled mind, attains the peace which is the summit of beatitude and which abides in Me.
6.15 Concentrating the mind thus for ever, the yogi of controlled mind achieves the Peace which culminates in Liberation and which abides in Me.
6.15 'Ever applying his mind on Me,' i.e., the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Person and the holy and auspicious object of meditation, 'the Yogin of controlled mind,' i.e., one having his mind steady because of his being purified in mind through contact with Me, comes to the peace which abides in Me, which is of the highest degree of beatitude. That means he comes to the peace which is the supreme end of beatitude which abides in Me.

For the person who commences Yoga of the self, Sri Krsna, after thus teaching how the mind should be fixed on the Lord, who is the holy and auspicious object of meditation, proceeds in order to effect the purification of the mind, to speak of the other side of Yoga:
6.10-15 Yogi etc. upto adhigacchati.  Self :  the mind.  Let him yoke it :  let him make it single-pointed.  Always : not for a limited period of time.  If the conditions like remaining alone etc., are fulfilled, this [controlling of mind] is possible and not otherwise.  On account of the firmness of seat, the time-nerve  (or the body ?)  remains firm and due to this, mind remains firm.  He, by whom the mental activities  i.e.,  those that are in the form of intention, and  other activities  of the sense-organs are subdued  i.e.,  are brought under full control; [he is the person of the subdued  mental and sensual activities].  Holding :  i.e., with effort.  If the nose-tip is looked at,  [it is possible]  not to look  at  [different]  directions.  Let him remain endowed with the state of having  Me alone as supreme goal.  This is the meaning  [here].  He who yokes  i.e.,  concentrates  his self (mind)  in this manner, there arises for him Peace in  which the culmination - as far as the end-is the same as attaining  Me.
6.15 Yunjan, concentrating; atmanam, the mind; evam, thus, according to the methods shown above; sada, for ever; the yogi, niyata-manasah, of controlled mind; adhi-gacchati, achieves; santim, the Peace, the indifference to worldly attachments and possessions; nirvana-paramam, which culminates in Liberation; and mat-samstham, which abides in Me.
Now are bieng mentioned the rules about the yogi's food etc.:
6.16 Verily Yoga is not possible for him who eats too much, nor for him who does not eat at all, nor for him who sleeps too much, nor for him who is (always) awake, O Arjuna.
6.16 Meditation is not for him who eats too much, not for him who eats not at all; not for him who is overmuch addicted to sleep, not for him who is always awake.
6.16. Yoga is neither for him who eats too much; nor for him who totally abstains from eating; nor for him who is prone to sleep too much; and nor for him who keeps awake too much.
6.16 Yoga is not for him who over-eats, nor for him who fasts excessively; not for him, O Arjuna, who sleeps too much, nor for him who stays awake too long.
6.16 But, O Arjuna, Yoga is not for one who eats too much, nor for one who does not eat at all; neither for one who habitually sleeps too long, nor surely for one who keeps awake.
6.16 Over-eating and excessive fasting are opposed to Yoga. So also are excessive recreation and non-recreation, too much of sleep and too much of vigil. So too, are overwork and idleness.
6.16 See Comment under 6.17
6.16 (Tu, but) O Arjuna, Yoga na asti, is not; atiasnatah, for one who eats too much, for one who eats food more than his capacity; na ca, nor is Yoga; anasnatah, for one who does not eat; ekantam, at all. This accords with the Vedic text, 'As is well known, if one eats that much food which is within one's capacity, then it sustains him, it does not hurt him; that which is more, it harms him; that which is less, it does not sustain him' (Sa. Br.; Bo. Sm. 2.7.22). Therefore, a yogi should not eat food more or less than what is suitable for him. Or the meaning is that Yoga is not for one who eats more food than what is prescribed for a yogi in the scriptures on Yoga. Indeed, the antity has been mentioned in, 'One half of the stomach is to be filled with food including curries; the third arter is to be filled with water; but the fourth arter is to be left for the movement of air,' etc.
Similarly, Yoga is not for ati svapna-silasya, one who habitually sleeps too long; and Yoga is na eva, surely not; jagratah, for one who keeps awake too long.
How, again, does Yoga become possibel? This is being stated:
6.17 Yoga becomes the destroyer of pain for him who is moderate in eating and recreation (such 
as walking, etc.), who is moderate in exertion in actions, who is moderate in sleep and wakefulness.
6.17 But for him who regulates his food and recreation, who is balanced in action, in sleep and in waking, it shall dispel all unhappiness.
6.17. The Yoga becomes a misery-killer for him whose effort for food is appropriate, exertion in activities is proper, and sleep and waking are proportionate.
6.17 Yoga becomes the destroyer of sorrows to him who is temperate in food and recreation, who is temperate in actions, who is temperate in sleep and wakefulness.
6.17 Yoga becomes a destroyer of sorrow of one whose eating and movements are regulated, whose effort in works is moderate, and whose sleep and wakefulness are temperate.
6.17 The 'yoga which destroys all sorrows,' i.e., unties bondages, is successfully practised by him who is temperate in eating and recreation, temperate in exertion, and temperate in sleep and vigil.
6.16-17 Yogosti etc.  Yuktahara   etc.  For foods :  for sense-objects that are being brought  [by sense-organs].  Effort  :  activity  for  enjoying  [them].  Its  appropriateness is  neither to  have unlimited indulgence,  nor  to have  unlimited  abstention.  The same is in all cases.  The rest  [of the text]  is clear.  On the authority of  the  Sage  [Vyasa],  the form jagaratah etc.  [may be viewed correct] as those in the Vedic literature.   The same is in other similar instances also.
6.17 Yogah bhavati, Yoga becomes; duhkha-ha, a destroyer of sorrow-that which destroys (hanti) all sorrows (duhkhani)-, i.e., Yoga destroys all worldly sorrows; yukta-ahara-viharasya, of one whose eating and movements are regulated- ahara (lit. food) means all that is gathered in, [According to the Commentator, ahara, which also means food, includes mental 'food as well. See Ch. 7.26.2.-Tr.] and vihara means moving about, walking; one for whom these two are regulated (yukta) is yukta-ahara-vihara-; and also yukta-cestasya, of one whose effort (cesta) is moderate (yukta); karmasu, in works; similarly, yukta-svapna-avabodhasya, of one whose sleep (svapna) and wakefulness (avabodha) are temperate (yukta), have regulated periods. To him whose eating and movements are regulated, whose effort in work is moderate, whose sleep and wakefulness are temperate, Yoga becomes a destroyer of sorrows.
When does a man become concentrated? That is being presently stated:
6.18 When the perfectly controlled mind rests in the Self only, free from longing for all the objects of desires, then it is said, 'He is united'.
6.18 When the mind, completely controlled, is centered in the Self, and free from all earthly desires, then is the man truly spiritual.
6.18. When [his] well-controlled mind gets established in nothing but the Self and he is free from craving for any desired object-at that time his is called a master of  Yoga.
6.18 When the subdued mind rests on the self alone, then, free of all yearning for objects of desire, one is said to be fit for Yoga.
6.18 A man who has become free from hankering for all desirable objects is then said to be Self-absorbed when the controlled mind rests in the Self alone.
6.18 When the mind which usually goes after sense enjoyments, abandons such desires and 'rests on the self alone,' i.e., becomes well-settled on account of discerning unsurpassable good in the self alone and rests there alone steadily, without movement - then, being 'free of yearning for all desires,' one is said to be integrated. He is said to be fit for Yoga.
6.18 Yada  etc.  The distinguishing  mark of this man of  Yoga is : Havnig  his mind controlled in nothing but the Self, he does not crave at all  [for anything].
6.18 A yogi, nihsprhah, who has become free from hankering, thirst; sarva-kamhyah, for all desirable objects, seen and unseen; is tada, then; ucyate, said to be; yuktah, Self-absorbed; yada, when; the viniyatam, controlled; cittam, mind, the mind that has been made fully one-pointed by giving up thought of external objects; avatisthate, rests; atmani eva, in the non-dual Self alone, i.e. he gets established in his own Self.
An illustration in being given for the mind of that yogi which has become Self-absorbed:
6.19 As a lamp placed in a windless spot does not flicker  to such is compared the Yogi of controlled mind, practising Yoga in the Self (or absorbed in the Yoga of the Self).
6.19 The wise man who has conquered his mind and is absorbed in the Self is as a lamp which does not flicker, since it stands sheltered from every wind.
6.19. 'Just as a lamp in the windless place does not shake' - This simile is recalled in the case of the man of Yoga, with subdued mind,  practising the Yoga in the Self.
6.19 'A lamp does not flicker in a windless place' - that is the simile employed for the subdued mind of a Yogin who practises Yoga.
6.19 As a lamp kept in a windless place does not flicker, such is the simile thought of for the yogi whose mind is under control, and who is engaged in concentration on the Self.
6.19 As a lamp does not flicker in a windless place, i.e., does not move, but remains steady with its illumination - this is the simile used to illustrate the nature of the self of the Yogin who has subdued his mind, who has got rid of all other kinds of mental activity and who is practising Yoga concerning the self. The meaning is that the self remains with its steadily illumining light of knowledge because all other activities of the mind have ceased, just as a lamp kept in a windless place has an unflickering flame.
6.19 Yatha  etc.   Just as a lamp  existing in the  windless  palce does not  shake, so is the man of  Yoga.  Shaking in his case is the efforts  like aciring sense  objects  and so on.									
 Now,  the characteristic of this  Brahman - Itself   being  Its  own  nature - is described  indirectly with a good number of adjectives.   This is different from the characteristics assumed in other  systems -
6.19 Yatha, as; a dipah, lamp; nivata-sthah, kept in a windless place; na ingate, does not flicker; sa upama, such is the simile-that with which something is compared is an upama (smile)-; smrta, thought of, by the knowers of Yoga who understand the movements of the mind; yoginah, for the yogi; yata-citasya, whose mind is under control; and yunjatah, who is engaged in; yogam, concentration; atmanah, on the Self, i.e. who is practising Self-absorption.
By dint of practising Yoga thus, when the mind, comparable to a lamp in a windless place, becomes concentrated, then-
6.2 Do thou, O Arjuna, know Yoga to be that which they call renunciation; no one verily becomes a Yogi who has not renounced thoughts.
6.2 O Arjuna! Renunciation is in fact what is called Right Action. No one can become spiritual who has not renounced all desire.
6.2. What [the learned] call renunciation, O son of  Pandu, know that to be [the same as]  the  Yoga.  For without renouncing intention [for fruit], one does not become a man of  Yoga.
6.2 That which is called Sannyasa (Jnana Yoga), know that to be Yoga (Karma Yoga), O Arjuna. For (among Karma Yogins) no one whose delusive identification of the body with the self is not abandoned, becomes a true Karma Yogin.
6.2 That which they call monasticism, know that to be Yoa, O Pandava, For, nobody who has not given up expectations can be a yogi.
6.2 Know Karma Yoga only to be that which they call as Sannyasa i.e., as Jnana Yoga or knowledge of the real nature of the self. Sri Krsna substantiates this by the words, 'For no one whose delusive identification of the body with the self is not abandoned, becomes a true Karma Yogin.' 'One whose delusion is abandoned is one by whom the delusion of identifying the self with Prakrti (body), which is in reality distinct from the self, is not rejected by the contemplation of the real nature of the self. One who is not of this kind is one whose delusion is not abandoned. One who is not of this kind cannot become a Karma Yogin of the type described here. It has already been said:  'He whose every undertaking is free from desire for fruits and delusive identification of the body with the self ৷৷.' (4.19).

Sri Krsna now teaches that by Karma Yoga alone one succeeds in Yoga without the risk of fall.
6.1-2 The subject matter that has been thus established in the series of the preceding chapters is summarised by a couple of  verses.
 
Anasritah etc.  Yam etc.  Bounden :  Ordained  [in the law books]  according to one's caste etc.  [Thus] man-lf-renunciation and man-of-Yoga are synonyms.  That is why  [the Lord]  says,  'what [the learned]  call renunciation' etc.   Therefore, without  Yoga no renunciation is possible.  Similarly  Yoga is not possible  without renouncing  the intention  [for fruit]. Conseently, the Yoga and renunciation are ever interlinked.  The idea, suggested by 'not he who remains  [simply]  without his  fires etc.'  is this :  He remains neither without fires, nor without actions and yet he is man of  renunciation,  Hence this is strange.	
 Of course,  following  the principle [involved in the statement]  'Playing  dice is the kingship, without  throne',  and  following logic it has been asserted  already that renunciation  is not possible for a person who remains simply without actions.  Yet-
6.2 Yam, that which is characterized by the giving up of all actions and their results; which prahuh, they, the knowers of the Vedas and the Smrtis, call; sannyasam iti, monasticism, in the real sense; viddhi, known; tam, that monasticism in the real sense; to be yogam, Yoga, consisting in the performance of actions, O Pandava.
Accepting what kind of similarity between Karma-yoga, which is characterized by engagement (in actions), and its opposite, renunciation in the real sense, which is characterized by cessation from work, has their eation been stated?
When such an apprehension arises, the answer is this; From the point of view of the agent, there does exist a simialrity of Karma-yoga with real renunciation. For he who is a monk in the real sense, from the very fact of his having given up all the means needed for accomplishing actions, gives up the thought of all actions and their results-the source of desire that leads to engagement in work. [Thoughts about an object lead to the desire for it, which in turn leads to actions for getting it. (Also see note under 4.19)] also, even while performing actions, gives up the thought for results.
Pointing out this idea, the Lord says: Hi, for; kascit, nobody, no man of action whosoever; asannyasta-sankalpah, who has not given up expactaions-one by whom has not been renounced expectation, anticipation, of results;bhavati, becomes, i.e. can become; yogi, a yogi, a man of concentration, because thought of results is the cause of the disturbance of mind. Therefore, any man of action who gives up the thought of results would become a yogi, a man of concentration with an unperturbed mind, because of his having given up thought of results which is the cause of mental distractions. This is the purport.
Thus, because of the similarity of real monasticism with Karma-yoga from the point of veiw of giving up by the agent, Karma-yoga is extolled as monasticism in, 'That which they call monasticism, know that to be Yoga, O Pandava.'
Since Karma-yoga, which is independent of results, is the remote help to Dhyana-yoga, therefore it has been praised as monasticism. Thereafter, now the Lord shows how Karma-yoga is helpful to Dhyana-yoga:
6.20 When the mind, restrained by the practice of Yoga attains to quietude and when seeing the Self by the self, he is satisfied in his own Self.
6.20 There, where the whole nature is seen in the light of the Self, where the man abides within his Self and is satisfied there, its functions restrained by its union with the Divine, the mind finds rest.
6.20. Where the mind, well-restrained through Yoga-practice, remains iet; again where, observing, by the self, nothing but the Self, he (Yogi) is satisfied in the Self;
6.20 Where the mind, controlled by the practice of Yoga, rests and where seeing the self by the self one is delighted by the self only;
6.20 At the time when the mind restrained through the practice of Yoga gets withdrawn, and just when by seeing the Self by the self one remains contented in the Self alone [A.G. construes the word eva (certainly) with tusyati (remains contented).-Tr.];
6.20 - 6.23 Where, through the practice of Yoga, the mind, which is subdued everywhere by such practice, 'rejoices', i.e., rejoices in surpassing felicity; and where, perceiving through Yoga 'the self (Atman)' by 'the mind (Atman)' one is delighted by the self and indifferent to all other objects; and where, through Yoga, one 'knows', i.e., experiences that infinite happiness which can be grasped only by the 'intellect' contemplating on the self, but is beyond the grasp of the senses; where, remaining in that Yoga, one does not 'swerve from that state,' because of the overwhelming happiness that state confers; having gained which, he desires for it alone, even when he is awakened from Yoga, and does not hold anything else as a gain; where one is not moved even by 'the heaviest sorrow' caused by any berevaement like that of a virtuous son - let him know that disunion from all union with pain, i.e., which forms the opposite of union with pain, is called by the term Yoga. This Yoga must be practised with the determination of its nature as such from the beginning with a mind free from despondency, i.e., with zestful exaltation.
6.20 See Comment under 6.23
6.20 Yatra, at the time when; cittam, the mind; niruddham, restrained, entirely prevented from wandering; uparamate, gets withdrawn; yoga-sevaya, through the practice of Yoga; ca, and; yatra eva, just when, at the very moment when; pasyan, by seeing, by experiencing; atmanam, the Self, which by nature is the supreme light of Consciousness; atmana, by the self, by the mind purified by concentration; tusyati, one remains contented, gets delighted; atmani eva, in one's own Self alone-. [Samadhi is of two kinds, Samprajnata and Asamprajnata. The concentration called right knowledge (Samprajnata) is that which is followed by reasoning, discrimination, blisss and unqualified egoism. Asamprajnata is that which is attained by the constant practice of cessation of all mental activity, in which the citta retains only the unmanifested impressions.-Cf. C. W., Vol. I, 1962, pp. 210, 212. According to A.G. the verses upto 6.20 state in a general way the characteristics of samadhi. From the present verse to the 25th, Asamprajnata-samadhi is introduced and defined.-Tr.] Besides,
6.21 When he (the Yogi) feels that Infinite Bliss which can be grasped by the (pure) intellect and which transcends the senses, and established wherein he never moves from the Reality.
6.21 When he enjoys the Bliss which passes sense, and which only the Pure Intellect can grasp, when he comes to rest within his own highest Self, never again will he stray from reality.
6.21. Where he realises that  limitless Bliss Which is to be grasped by intellect and is beyond sences; remaining Where he does not stir out from the Reality;
6.21 Where one knows that infinite happiness which can be grasped by the intellect but is beyond the grasp of the senses, wherein established one swerves not from that condition;
6.21 When one experienece that absolute Blisss which can be intuited by the intellect and which is beyond the senses, and being established (thus) this person surely does not swerve from Reality;
6.20 - 6.23 Where, through the practice of Yoga, the mind, which is subdued everywhere by such practice, 'rejoices', i.e., rejoices in surpassing felicity; and where, perceiving through Yoga 'the self (Atman)' by 'the mind (Atman)' one is delighted by the self and indifferent to all other objects; and where, through Yoga, one 'knows', i.e., experiences that infinite happiness which can be grasped only by the 'intellect' contemplating on the self, but is beyond the grasp of the senses; where, remaining in that Yoga, one does not 'swerve from that state,' because of the overwhelming happiness that state confers; having gained which, he desires for it alone, even when he is awakened from Yoga, and does not hold anything else as a gain; where one is not moved even by 'the heaviest sorrow' caused by any berevaement like that of a virtuous son - let him know that disunion from all union with pain, i.e., which forms the opposite of union with pain, is called by the term Yoga.

6.20 See Comment under 6.23
6.21 Yatra, when, at the time when; vetti, one experiences; tat, that; atyantikam, absolute-which is verily limitless, i.e. infinite; sukham, Bliss; yat, which; buddhi-grahyam, can be intuited by the intellect, intuited by the intellect alone, without the help of the senses; and which is atindriyam, beyond the senses, i.e. not objective; (-when one experieneces this kind of Bliss) and sthitah, being established in the nature of the Self; ayam, this person, the illumined one; eva, surely; na calati, does not swerve; tattvatah, from that Reality-i.e. does not deviate from the nature of Reality-.
Further,
6.22 Which, having obtained, he thinks there is no other gain superior to it; wherein estabished, he is not moved even by heavy sorrow.
6.22 Finding That, he will realise that there is no possession so precious. And when once established here, no calamity can disturb him.
6.22. And having attained Which, he does not think of any other gain as superior to That; being established in Which he is not shaken much by misery, however powerful that may be;
6.22 Which, having gained, one holds there is no greater gain beyond it; wherein established, one is not moved even by the heaviest sorrow -
6.22 Obtaining which one does not think of any other acisition to be superior to that, and being established in which one is not perturbed even by great sorrow;
6.20 - 6.23 Where, through the practice of Yoga, the mind, which is subdued everywhere by such practice, 'rejoices', i.e., rejoices in surpassing felicity; and where, perceiving through Yoga 'the self (Atman)' by 'the mind (Atman)' one is delighted by the self and indifferent to all other objects; and where, through Yoga, one 'knows', i.e., experiences that infinite happiness which can be grasped only by the 'intellect' contemplating on the self, but is beyond the grasp of the senses; where, remaining in that Yoga, one does not 'swerve from that state,' because of the overwhelming happiness that state confers; having gained which, he desires for it alone, even when he is awakened from Yoga, and does not hold anything else as a gain; where one is not moved even by 'the heaviest sorrow' caused by any berevaement like that of a virtuous son - let him know that disunion from all union with pain, i.e., which forms the opposite of union with pain, is called by the term Yoga.

6.22 Labdhva, obtaining; yam, which-by aciring which Self-attainment; na manyate, one does not think; that there is aparam, any other; labham, acisition; tatah adhikam, superior to that; and also, sthitah,being established; yasmin, in which Reality of the Self; na vicalyate, one is not perturbed; api, even; guruna, by great; duhkhena, sorrow, as may be caused by being struck with weapons, etc.-.
The yoga that has been spoken of as a particular state of the Self, distinguished by its characterisics in the verses beginning with 'At the time when the mind gets withdrawn,' (20) etc.-
6.23 Let that be known by the name of Yoga, the severance from union with pain. This Yoga should be practised with determination and with an undesponding mind.
6.23 This inner severance from the affliction of misery is spirituality. It should be practised with determination and with a heart which refuses to be depressed.
6.23. That he would realise to be the cause for [his] cessation of [his] contact with misery and to be the one made known by Yoga.  With determination That is to be yoked in Yoga by a person of undepressed mind (or of the depressed mind).
6.23 Know this deliverance from association with misery to be Yoga. This Yoga must be practised with determination and with a mind free from despondency.
6.23 One should know that severance of contact with sorrow to be what is called Yoga. That Yoga has to be practised with perservance and with an undepressed heart.
6.20 - 6.23 Where, through the practice of Yoga, the mind, which is subdued everywhere by such practice, 'rejoices', i.e., rejoices in surpassing felicity; and where, perceiving through Yoga 'the self (Atman)' by 'the mind (Atman)' one is delighted by the self and indifferent to all other objects; and where, through Yoga, one 'knows', i.e., experiences that infinite happiness which can be grasped only by the 'intellect' contemplating on the self, but is beyond the grasp of the senses; where, remaining in that Yoga, one does not 'swerve from that state,' because of the overwhelming happiness that state confers; having gained which, he desires for it alone, even when he is awakened from Yoga, and does not hold anything else as a gain; where one is not moved even by 'the heaviest sorrow' caused by any berevaement like that of a virtuous son - let him know that disunion from all union with pain, i.e., which forms the opposite of union with pain, is called by the term Yoga. This Yoga must be practised with the determination of its nature as such from the beginning with a mind free from despondency, i.e., with zestful exaltation.
6.20-23  Yatra etc.  upto anirvinna-cetasa.  Where  the mind well restrained  remains iet :  i.e.,  on its  own accord.  Where he realises the limitless  Bliss :  Becuase the dirts  created by the sense-objects  are absent.   Any  other gain :  the gain obtained through the close contacts with wealth. wives, childeren etc.  The  idea is :  With regard to other objects, the notion of their being sources of  pleasure disappears;  and it is the nature of the thing in estion.  Not shaken much :  not shaken  to a great extent;  [hence]  there is yet [a little]  shaking in him,  purely due to [former]  mental impression;  and it  lasts  only  for a moment due to his compassion  [towards all creatures],  and not due to the wrong notions  like 'Alas !  I am undone !  What  is to done  by me.'  and  so on.  That,  due to which the cessation of contact with  misery results-that  must be yoked  i.e.,  practised  (concentrated upon)  by all means, with determination  i.e.,  with faith, born of the belief  [in the Self].  Of  undepressed mind.  i.e., because the goal has been reached. Or of  depressed  mind :  i.e., depressed that the birth-and-death-cycle is very  firm and is full of misery.						
 The means for abandoning desire is to abandon intention.  This (the Lord) says :
6.23 Vidyat, one should know; tat, that; duhkha-samyoga-viyogam, severance (viyoga) of contact (samyoga) with sorrow (duhkha); to be verily yoga-sanjnitam, what is called Yoga-i.e. oen should know it through a negative definition.
After concluding the topic of the result of Yoga, the need for pursuing Yoga is again being spoken of in another way in order to enjoin 'preservance' and 'freedom from depression' as the disciplines for Yoga: Sah, that; yogah, Yoga, which has
the results as stated above; yoktavyah, has to be practised; niscayena, with perservance; and anirvinnacetasa, with an undepressed heart. That which is not (a) depressed (nirvinnam) is anirvinnam. What is that? The heart. (One has to practise Yoga) with that heart which is free from depression. This is the meaning.
Again,
6.24 Abandoning without reserve all desires born of Sankalpa (thought and imagination) and completely restraining the whole group of the senses by the mind from all sides.
6.24 Renouncing every desire which imagination can conceive, controlling the senses at every point by the power of mind;
6.24. In order ot renounce completely all desires that are born of intention, let a person, restraining the group of sense-organs from all sides by mind alone;
6.24 Renouncing entirely all desires born of volition and restraining the mind from all the senses on all sides;
6.24 By totally eschewing all desires which arise from thoughts, and restraining with the mind itself all the organs from every side;
6.24 - 6.25 There are two kinds of desires:  1) those born of contact between the senses and objects like heat, cold etc.; 2) those generated by our mind (will) like that for sons, land etc. Of these, the latter type of desires are by their own nature relinishable. Relinishing all these by the mind through contemplation on their lack of association with the self; having relinished the ideas of pleasure and pain in respect of unavoidable desires resulting from contract; restraining all the senses on all sides, i.e., from contact with all their objects - one should think of nothing else, i.e., other than the self. Little by little 'with the help of intellect controlled by firm resolution,' i.e., by the power of discrimination, one should think of nothing else, having fixed the mind on the self.
6.24 See Comment under 6.25
6.24 See Commentary under 6.25
6.25 Little by little let him attain to ietude by the intellect held firmly; having made the mind establish itself in the Self, let him not think of anything.
6.25 Little by little, by the help of his reason controlled by fortitude, let him attain peace; and, fixing his mind on the Self, let him not think of any other thing.
6.25. Very slowly remain iet,  keeping the mind well established in the Self by means of the intellect held in steadiness; and lest him not think of anything (object).
6.25 Little by little one should withdraw oneself from the objects other than the self with the help of the intellect held by firm resolution; and then one should think of nothing else, having fixed the mind upon the self.
6.25 One should gradually withdraw with the intellect endowed with steadiness. Making the mind fixed in the Self, one should not think of anything whatsoever.
6.24 - 6.25 There are two kinds of desires:  1) those born of contact between the senses and objects like heat, cold etc.; 2) those generated by our mind (will) like that for sons, land etc. Of these, the latter type of desires are by their own nature relinishable. Relinishing all these by the mind through contemplation on their lack of association with the self; having relinished the ideas of pleasure and pain in respect of unavoidable desires resulting from contract; restraining all the senses on all sides, i.e., from contact with all their objects - one should think of nothing else, i.e., other than the self. Little by little 'with the help of intellect controlled by firm resolution,' i.e., by the power of discrimination, one should think of nothing else, having fixed the mind on the self.
6.24-25 Sankalpa - etc.  Sanaih etc.  By mind alone : i.e.,  not by withdrawing  from activities.  Holding steadiness;  thinning,  step after step,  the misery  born  of desired;  let him not think anything  like receiving and abandoning  objects and so on.
 
Others have  explained [the passage]  as 'Let him think only negation (or void).  But this (explanation) is not up to our taste.  For, that world result in the doctrine of nihilism.									
 What is to be  achieved  is not a  mere withdrawl  [or one-self]  from the objects.  This is stated  as -
6.25 Tyaktva, by eschewing; asesatah, totally, without a trace; sarvan, all; the kamam, desires; sankalpa-prabhavan, which arise from thoughts; and further, viniyamya, restraining; manasa eva, with the mind itself, with the mind endued with discrimination; indriya-gramam, all the organs; samantatah, from every side; uparamet, one should withdraw, abstain; sanaih sanaih, gradually, not suddenly;-with what?-buddhya, with the intellect;- possessed of what distinction?-dhrti-grhitaya, endowed with steadiness, i.e. with fortitude.
Krtva, making manah, the mind; atma-samstham, fixed in the Self, with the idea, 'The Self alone is all; there is nothing apart from It'-thus fixing the mind on the Self; na cintayet, one should not think of; kincit api, anything whatsoever.
Thisis the highest instruction about Yoga.
6.26 From whatever cause the restless and unsteady mind wanders away, from that let him restrain it and bring it under the control of the Self alone.
6.26 When the volatile and wavering mind would wander, let him restrain it and bring it again to its allegiance to the Self.
6.26. By whatever things the shaky and unsteady mind goes astray, from those things let him restrain it and bring it back to the control of the Self alone.
6.26 Wherever the fickle and unsteady mind wanders, he should subdue it then and there bring it back under the control of the self alone.
6.26 (The yogi) should bring (this mind) under the subjugation of the Self Itself, by restraining it from all those causes whatever due to which the restless, unsteady mind wanders away.
6.26 Wherever the mind, on account of its fickle and unsteady nature, wanders, because of its proclivity to sense-objects, he should, subduing the mind everywhere with effort, bring it under control in order to remain in the self alone by contemplating on the incomparable bliss therein.
6.26 See Comment under 6.28
6.26 In the beginning, the yogi who is thus engaged in making the mind established in the Self, etat vasamnayet, should bring this (mind) under the subjugation; atmani eva, of the Self Itself; niyamya, by restraining; etat. it; tatah tatah, from all those causes whatever, viz sound etc.; yatah yatah, due to which, doe to whatever objects like sound etc.; the cancalam, restless, very restless; and therefore asthiram, unsteady; manah, mind; niscarati, wanders away, goes out due to its inherent defects. (It should be restrained) by ascertaining through discrimination those causes to be mere appearances, and with an attitude of detachment. Thus, through the power of practice of Yoga, the mind of the yogi merges in the Self Itself.
6.27 Supreme Bliss verily comes to this Yogi whose mind is ite peaceful, whose passion is ieted, who has become Brahman and who is free from sin.
6.27 Supreme Bliss is the lot of the sage, whose mind attains Peace, whose passions subside, who is without sin, and who becomes one with the Absolute.
6.27. Indeed the Supreme Bliss comes to this highly tranil-minded man of  Yoga, whose passions remain ietened, who has become the Brahman and who is free from sins.
6.27 For supreme happiness comes to the Yogin whose mind is at peace, who is free of evil, from whom the Rajas has departed, and who has become the Brahman.
6.27 Supreme Bliss comes to this yogi alone whose mind has become perfectly tranil, whose (ality of) rajas has been eliminated, who has become identified with Brahman, and is taintless.
6.27 Supreme happiness, which is of the nature of experience of the self in its essential nature comes to this Yogin whose 'mind is at peace,' i.e., whose mind does not swerve from the self, whose mind abides in the self; whose impurities are thery completely burnt away; whose Rajas is thery 'wholly annulled,' i.e., in whom the ality of Rajas is destroyed; and who has thus become the Brahman, i.e., who remains steady in his essential nature as the Atman. 'Hi' (for) is added to indicate reason. The meaning is this:  'On account of the nature of the self which has the form of supreme bliss.'
6.27 See Comment under 6.27
6.27 Uttamam, supreme, unsurpassable; sukham, Blisss; upaiti, comes; hi enam yoginam, to this yogi alone; prasanta-manasam, whose mind has become perfectly tranil; santa-rejasam, whose (ality of) rajas has been eliminated, i.e. whose rajas, viz defects such as delusion etc. ['The five klesas, pain-bearing obstructions, are: ignorance, egoism, attachment, aversion, and clinging to life' (P.Y.Su.2.3).] have been destroyed; brahma-bhutam, who has become identified with Brahman, who is free even while living, who has got the certitude that Bramhman is all; and akalmasam, who is taintless, free from vice etc.
6.28 The Yogi, always engaging the mind thus (in the practice of Yoga), freed from sins, easily enjoys the Infinite Bliss of contact with Brahman (the Eternal).
6.28 Thus, free from sin, abiding always in the Eternal, the saint enjoys without effort the Bliss which flows from realisation of the Infinite.
6.28. Thus yoking the self always, the man of Yoga, with subdued mind, easily attains a complete union [viz.,] the Brahman.
6.28 Thus devoting himself to the Yoga of the self, freed from impurities, the Yogin easily attains the supreme bliss of contact with the Brahman.
6.28 By concentrating his mind constantly thus, the taintless yogi easily attains the absolute Bliss of contact with Brahman.
6.28 Thus, in the above - said manner, devoting himself to the Yoga of the self and by that means expelling all old impurities, the Yogin attains 'perfect', i.e., boundless felicity at all times easily, without stress and strain. The felicity is born of the contact with the Brahman (Atman), meaning the joy of experience of the Brahman.

Now Sri Krsna says that the mature stage of Yoga consists of four degrees, as stated in the succeeding verses from 29th to 32nd.
6.26-28  Yatah etc.  upto adhigacchati.  From whatever objects  the mind returns,  immediately after  its return,  let him ieten it on the Self.  Otherwise, being not firmly  established  [in the Self],  the mind  would again  take hold of nothing but the sense-objects.  But the Bliss, assuming  the roll of an agent  (or subject, kartv-bhuta)  comes to the object  (karmabhuta),  viz., the man-of-Yoga, whose  mind remains ite in the Self.  By this way alone the men-of-Yoga attain the Brahman easily and not by  [any] difficult Yoga etc.   This is the idea  [here].
6.28 Sada yunjan, by constantly concentrating; atmanam, his mind; evam, thus, in the process stated; vigata-kalmasah, the taintles, sinless yogi, free from the obstacles to Yoga; sukhena, easily; asnute, attains; atayantam, absolute-that which exists by transcending limits-, supreme, unsurpassable; sukham, Bliss; of brahma-samsparsam, contact with Brahman-the Bliss that is in touch [In touch with, i.e. identified with, homogeneous with, in essential oneness with.] with the supreme Brahman.
Now is being shown that result of Yoga which is the realization of identity with Brahman and which is the cause of the extinction of the whole mundane existence . [Liberation is conceived of in two ways-total cessation of sorrows, and attainment of unsurpassable Bliss.]
6.29 With the mind harmonised by Yoga he sees the Self abiding in all beings and all beings in the Self; he sees the same everywhere.
6.29 He who experiences the unity of life sees his own Self in all beings, and all beings in his own Self, and looks on everything with an impartial eye;
6.29. He, who has yoked the self in Yoga and observes everything eally perceives the Self to be abiding in all beings and all beings to be abiding in the Self.
6.29 He whose mind is fixed in Yoga sees eality everywhere; he sees his self as abiding in all beings and all beings in his self.
6.29 One who has his mind Self-absorbed through Yoga, and who has the vision of sameness every-where, see this Self existing in everything, and every-thing in his Self.
6.29 (i) On account of the similarity between one self and other selves when They are separated from Prakrti (i.e., the body), all selves are by Themselves only of the nature of knowledge. Inealities pertain only to Prakrti or the bodies they are embodied in. One whose mind is fixed in Yoga has the experience of the sameness of the nature of all the selves as centres of intelligence, the perceived difference being caused only by the body. When separated from the body all are alike because of their being forms of centres of intelligence. An enlightened Yogin therefore sees himself as abiding in all beings and all beings abiding in his self in the sense that he sees the similarity of the selves in himself and in every being. When one self is visualised, all selves become visulaised, because of the similarity of all selves. This is supported by the statements:  'He sees sameness everywhere' (6.29). The same is again referred to in, 'This Yoga of eality which has been declared by you' (6.33), and the statement 'The Brahman when uncontaminated is the same everywhere' (5.19).
6.29 Sarva - etc.  Let him consider the Self to be entering into (i.e., inherent in and manifesting as)  all beings as a perceiver  (or as a subject); again let him unify all beings in the Self through his realisation of the Self as being object [for them].  As a result of this, there arises a capacity to observe eally and also arises the Yoga.  This is in short what is meant here.  The details have been dealt with by myself  (Ag.) in [my] manual, like the bhedavadavidarana and  [my commentary],  the Devistotra-Vivarana;  and hence they may be ascertained there only.	
 The same idea is made clear  [as] -
6.29 Yoga-yukta-atma, one who has his mind Self-absorbed through Yoga, whose mind is merged in samadhi; and sarvatra-sama-darsanah, who has the vision of sameness everywhere-who has the vision (darsana) of sameness (sama-tva), the knowledge of identity of the Self and Brahman everywhere (sarvatra) without exception, in all divergent objects beginning from Brahma to immovable things; iksate, sees; atmanam, the Self, his own Self; sarva-bhuta-stham, existing in everything; and sarva-bhutani, everything from Brahma to a clump of grass; unified atmani, in his Self.
The fruit of this realization of the unity of the Self is being stated:
6.3 For a sage who wishes to attain to Yoga, action is said to be the means; for the same sage who has attained to Yoga, inaction (iescence) is said to be the means.
6.3 For the sage who seeks the heights of spiritual meditation, practice is the only method, and when he has attained them, he must maintain himself there by continual self-control.
6.3. For a sage, who is desirous of  mounting upon the Yoga, action is said to be the cause;  for the same [sage], when he has mounted upon the Yoga, ietude is said to be the cause.
6.3 Action is said to be the means for the sage who seeks to climb the heights of Yoga; but when he has climbed the heights of Yoga, tranillity is said to be the means.
6.3 For the sage who wishes to ascend to (Dhyana-) yoga, action is said to be the means. For that person, when he has ascended to (Dhyana-)yoga, inaction alone is said to be the means.
6.3 Karma Yoga is said to be the means for an aspirant for release who 'seeks to climb the heights of Yoga,' i.e., the vision of the self. For the same person, when he has climbed the 'heights of Yoga,' i.e., when he is established in Yoga - tranility, i.e., freedom from actions is said to be the means. A man should perform actions until he has attained release (Moksa) in the form of the vision of the self. Full release comes only with the fall of the body. The 'vision of the self' referred to here is called Moksa by courtesy.

When does not become established in Yoga?  Sri Krsna replies:
6.3 Aruruksoh etc  for a sage :  For a man of wisdom.  Action :  that which reires to be performed. Cause  (1st) : a means to attain.  Quietude : to remain uninterrupted at the stage  [already]  achieved.  Here Cause  (2nd) is an indicator.		
 The same idea is made clear as-
6.3 Aruruksoh, for one who wishes to ascend, who has not ascended, i.e. for that very person who is unable to remain established in Dhyana-yoga;-for which person who is desirous to ascend?-munch, for the sage, i.e. for one who has renounced the results of actions;-trying to ascend to what?-yogam, to (Dhyana-) yoga; karma, action; ucyate, is said to be; the karanam, means. Tasya, for that person, again; yoga-arudhasya, when he has ascended to (Dhyana-) yoga; samah, inaction, withdrawl from all actions; eva, alone; ucyate, is said to be; karanam, the means for remaining poised in the state of meditation. This is the meaning.
To the extent that one withdraws from actions, the mind of that man who is at cease and self-controlled becomes concentrated. When this occurs, he at once becomes established in Yoga. And accordingly has it been said by Vyasa: 'For a Brahmana there is no wealth conparable to (the knowledge of) oneness, sameness, truthfulness, character, eipoise, harmlessness, straightforwardness and withdrawal from various actions' (Mbh. Sa. 175.37).
After that, now is being stated when one becomes established in Yoga:
6.30 He who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, he never becomes separated from Me, nor do I become separated from him.
6.30 He who sees Me in everything and everything in Me, him shall I never forsake, nor shall he lose Me.
6.30. He who observes Me in all and observes all in Me-for him I am not lost and he too is not lost for me.
6.30 To him who sees Me in every self and sees every self in Me - I am not lost to him and he is not lost to Me.
6.30 One who sees Me in everything, and sees all things in Me-I do not out of his vision, and he also is not lost to My vision.
6.30 (ii) He who, having reached the highest stage of maturity, views similarity of nature with Me, i.e., sees similarity of all selves to Myself when They are freed from good and evil and when they remain in Their own essence, as declared in the Sruti, 'Stainless he attains supreme degree of eality' (Mun. U., 3.1.3); and 'sees Me in all selves and sees all selves in Me.' That is, on viewing one of Them (selves), one views another also to be the same, because of their similarity to one another. To him who perceives the nature of his own self, I am not lost on account of My similarity to him i.e., I do not become invisible to him. He (the Yogin) viewing his own self as similar to Me, always remains within My sight when I am viewing Myself, because of similarity of his self with Me.

Sri Krsna describes a still more mature steps (of Yoga):
6.30 Yo Mam etc.  Loss :  i.e.,  on account of serving no  purpose  [on the part of a thing].  For example : He who does not see the all-pervasive nature of the Supreme Self,  from him the Supreme Self has fled away, because It does not reveal Its own  nature.  Further,  this aggregate of objects,  which is being perceived,  remains settled  down in the Supreme  Self,   which is the  very nature of  their  illumination  (being known). Now, whosoever fails to veiw the object as such, he gets  lost from  the naute of that Supreme Self.  For, nothing shines without It.   On the other hand, he who finds Me  (the Supreme Consciousness) as immanent in all - for him I am not lost;  because  I appear [to him] in my own nature.  [Again], when he perceives objects in Me-when his perceiverhood is complete on account of the possibility of illumination and manifestation of these objects due to This - then he is not lost for the Supreme Self.
6.30 Yah, one who; pasyati, sees; mam, Me, Vasudeva, who am the Self of all; sarvatra, in all things; ca, and; sees sarvam, all things, all created things, beginning from Brahma; mayi, in Me who am the Self of all;-aham, I who am God; na pranasyami, do not go out; tasya,of his vision-of one who has thus realized the unity of the Self; ca sah, and he also; na pranasyati, is not lost; me, to My vision. That man of realization does not get lost to Me, to Vasudeva, because of the indentity between him and Me, for that which is called one's own Self is surely dear to one, and since it is I alone who am the seer of the unity of the Self in all.
6.31 He who, being established in unity, worships Me Who dwells in all beings, that Yogi abides in Me, whatever may be his mode of living.
6.31 The sage who realises the unity of life and who worships Me in all beings, lives in Me, whatever may be his lot.
6.31. He, who, established firmly in the oneness (of Me), experiences Me immanent in all beings-that man of Yoga, is never stained, in whatever stage he may be.
6.31 The Yogin who, fixed in oneness, worships Me dwelling in all beings - he abides in Me, howsoever he may live.
6.31 That yogi who, being established in unity, adores Me as existing in all things, he exist in Me-in whatever condition he may be.
6.31 (iii) The Yogin who, fixed in the state of Yoga in oneness because he has the same form of uncontracted knowledge (as Myself), worships Me steadfastly by renouncing the differences of the Prakrti (i.e., of the body) - then that Yogin, even while coming out of Yoga, howsoever he may live, views Me only, when viewing his own self and all other beings. The meaning is that he views his similarity to Myself in his own self and in the self of all beings.

Now Sri Krsna proceeds to speak of the maturest stage beyond this:
6.31 Sarva - etc.  Whosoever is  completely possessed of the  knowledge of this kind,  he necessarily realises the Bhagavat as one and immanent in all and does not get stained  [by any of his actions] is whatever condition he is.
6.31  
This being so, i.e. after reiterating (in the first line of the present verse) the idea of full realization contained in the previous verse, the result of that (realization), viz Liberation, is being spoken of (in the second line): The yogi, the man of full realization; vartate, exists; mayi, in Me, in the supreme state of Visnu; sarvatha api, in whatever condition; vartamanah, he may be. He is verily ever-free. The idea is that he is not obstructed from Liberation by anything.
Furthermore,
6.32 He who, through the likeness of the Self, O Arjuna, sees eality everywhere, be it pleasure or pain, he is regarded as the highest Yogi.
6.32 O Arjuna! He is the perfect saint who, taught by the likeness within himself, sees the same Self everywhere, whether the outer form be pleasurable or painful.
6.32. Whosoever finds pleasure or pain eally in all as in the case of himself-that person is considered to be a great man of Yoga, O Arjuna !
6.32 He who, by reason of the similarity of selves everywhere, sees the pleasure or pain as the same everywhere - that Yogin, O Arjuna, is deemed as the nighest.
6.32 O Arjuna, that yogi is considered the best who judges what is happiness and sorrow in all beings by the same standard as he would apply to himself.
6.32 (iv) He who - because of the similarity between his own self and other selves, as they are all constituted similarly of uncontracted knowledge in their essential being - views the pleasures in the form of the birth of a son and the sorrows in the form of the death of a son of his own and of others, as eal, on the ground of their eal unrelatedness to such pleasures and pains to him. Viewing his own pleasures and pains of the above description as being not different from those of others of the same kind - tht Yogin is deemed the highest; he is judged as having reached the summit of Yoga. [The idea is to prevent misconstruing the verse as meaning  that one shares the joy and misery of all as his own. It means only that the highest type of yogins understand that the self is unrelated to the pain and pleasures of his own body-mind. He understands also that the same is the case with other selves.]
6.32 Atma-etc.  'That he finds the pleasure  and pain of all on analogy of himself'.  This is only a statement of characteristic mark [of the Yogin];  and it is not an injunction enjoining a new action.
6.32 Atma-aupamyena: Atma means the self, i.e. oneself. That by which a comparison is made is an upama. The abstract from of that is aupamya. Atma-aupamya means a standard as would be applicable to oneself.
O Arjuna, yah, he who; pasyati, judges; sarvatra, in all beings; samam, by the same standard, in the same manner; atma-aupamyena, as he would apply to himself-. And what does he view with sameness? That is being stated: As sukham, happiness, is dear to me, so also is happiness agreeable to all creatures.
Va, and-the word va is (used) in the sense of and; just as yadi, whatever; duhkham, sorrow is unfavourable, unwelcome to me, so also is sorrow unwelcome and unfavourable to all creatures.
In this way, he looks upon happiness and sorrow as pleasant and unpleasant to all bengs, by the same standard as he would apply to himself. He does not act against anyone. That is , he is non-injurious. He who is thus non-injurious and steadfast in full Illumination, sah, that yogi; paramah matah, is considered as the best among all the yogis.
Noticing that his Yoga-as spoken of and consisting in full Illumination- is hard to acire, Arjuna, with a view to hearing the sure means to its attainment, said:
6.33 Arjuna said  This Yoga of eanimity taught by Thee, O Krishna, I do not see its steady continuance, because of the restlessness (of the mind).
6.33 Arjuna said: I do not see how I can attain this state of equanimity which Thou has revealed, owing to the restlessness of my mind.
6.33. Arjuna said  This Yoga of eal-mindedness which has been spoken of by You, O slayer of  Mandhu, I do not find [any]  proper foundation for it,  because of the unsteadiness of the mind.
6.33 Arjuna said  This Yoga of eality, which has been declared by You, O Krsna, I do not see that it can be steady because of the fickleness of the mind.
6.33 Arjuna said  O Madhusudana (Krsna), this Yoga that has been spoken of by You as sameness, I do not see its steady continuance, owing to the restlessness (of the mind).
6.33 Arjuna said  This Yoga as explained by you consists in maintaining eality of vision everywhere, viz., i) among themselves which have been so far known to be of different kinds such as gods and men, and ii) between the individual selves and the Supreme, in so far as (a) all the selves are of the same form of knowledge, and (b) in so far as the individual self (i.e., the released soul) and the Supreme are alike free from Karma. I do not see how this Yoga can be steadily established in my mind, fickle as the mind is.
6.33 See Comment under 6.34
6.33 O Madhusudana, ayam, this; yogah, Yoga; yah proktah, that has been spoken of; tvaya, by You; samyena, as sameness; na pasyami, I do not see, I cannot conceive;-what?-etasya, its; sthiram, steady, undisturbed; sthitim, continuance; cancalatvat, owing to the unsteadiness of the mind, which is well known.
6.34 The mind verily is restless, turbulent, strong and unyielding, O Krishna: I deem it as difficult to control it as to control the wind.
6.34 My Lord! Verily, the mind is fickle and turbulent, obstinate and strong, yea extremely difficult as the wind to control.
6.34. O Krsna !  The mind is indeed unsteady, destructive, strong and obstinate; to control it, I  believe, is very difficult, just as to control the wind.
6.34 For the mind is fickle, O Krsna, impetuous, powerful and stubborn. I think that restraint of it is as difficult as that of the wind.
6.34 For, O Krsna, the mind is unsteady, turbulent, strong and obstinate. I consider its control to be as greatly difficult as of the wind.
6.34 For the mind, which is found to be fickle even in matters incessantly practised, cannot be firmly fixed by a person in one place. It agitates that person violently and flies away stubbornly elsewhere. Regarding such a mind, which by nature is fickle even in matters practised, I regard that its restraint and fixing in the self, which is of ite opposite nature, is as difficult as restraining a strong contrary gale with such things as a fragile fan etc. The meaning is that the means for the restraint of the mind should be explained.
6.33-34 Yo' Yam etc.  Cancalam etc.  By this and  which,  the two words denoting  [respectively]  what is actually  perceived and what is  not perceived, the following is indicated :  Thanks  to the series of methods  spoken just before by the Bhagavat, the Brahman is of course  clear and has been no doubt  shown as if by perception.  Yet, It remains at agreat  distance due to the unsteadiness and wickedness of the mind,  and It behaves as if  It is beyond perception.  [Destructive] :  The mind destroys both the visible and invisible [ends of man's action].  Strong : Powerful.  Obstinate :  impossible  to ward off from evil acts.
 Now  the answer -
6.34 Hi, for, O Krsna-the word krsna is derived from the root krs [Another derivative meaning may be-'the capacity to draw towards Himself all glorious things of this and the other world'.], in the sense of 'uprooting'; He is Krsna because He uproots the defects such as sin etc. of devotees-; manah, the mind; is cancalam, unsteady. Not only is it very unsteady, it is also pramathi, turbulent. It torments, agitates, the body and the organs. It brings them under extraneous control. Besides, it is balavat, strong, not amenable ot anybody's restraint. Again, it is drdham, obstinate, hard as the (large shark called) Tantu-naga (also known as Varjuna-pasa).
Aham, I; manye, consider; tasya, its-of the mind which is of this kind; nigrahah, control, restraint; to be (suduskaram, greatly difficult;) vayoh iva, as of the wind. Control of the wind is difficult. I consider the control of the mind to be even more difficult than that. This is the idea.
'This is just as you say.'
6.35 The Blessed Lord said  Undoubtedly, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the mind is difficult to control and restless; but by practice and by dispassion it may be restrained.
6.35 Lord Shri Krishna replied: Doubtless, O Mighty One, the mind is fickle and exceedingly difficult to restrain, but, O Son of Kunti, with practice and renunciation it can be done.
6.35. The Bhagavat said  O mighty-armed !  No doubt, the mind is unsteady and is hard to control.  But it is controlled by  practice and through an attitude of desirelessness, O son of  Kunti !
6.35 The Lord said  The mind is hard to  subdue and fickle, no doubt, O mighty-armed one, but , O son of Kunti, by practice and by the exercise of dispassion it can be brought under control.
6.35 The Blessed Lord said  O mighty-armed one, undoubtedly the mind is untractable and restless. But, O son of Kunti, it is brought under control through practice and detachment.
6.35 The Lord said  No doubt, the mind is hard to subdue on account of its fickle nature. However, it can be subdued with difficulty by cultivating favourable attitude in the direction of the self by repeated contemplation of Its being a mind of auspicious attributes (these being eternality, self-luminosity, bliss, freedom from Karma, purity etc.), and by the absence of hankering produced by seeing the host of evil alities in objects other than the self hankered for.
6.35 Asamsayam etc.  Through an attitude of desirelessness,  the craving for sense objects is destroyed.  Through practice, stage  after stage, the side of emancipation is occupied  [by the mind].  Hence both are included.  Regarding this, it has been said by the revered author of the Bhasya as :
 
     The restraint of mental modifications depends on
     both [the attitude of desirelessness and practice]. 			
 Hence is this solemn declaration :
6.35 Mahabaho, O mighty-armed one; asamsayam, undoubtedly-there is no doubt with regard to this; that the manah, mind; is durnigraham, untractable; and calm, restless. Tu, but; it-the modifications of the mind in the form of distractions-grhyate, is brought under control; abhyasena, through practice- abhyasa means repetition of some idea or thought of the mind one some mental plane ['Some mental plane' suggests some object of concentration.]-; and vairagyena, through detachment-vairagya means absence of hankering for enjoyment of desirable things, seen or unseen, as a result of the practice of discerning their defect.
That mind is thus brought undr control, restrained, i.e. completely subdued.
By him, however, who has not controlled his mind-
6.36 I think Yoga is hard to be attained by one of uncontrolled self, but the self-controlled and striving one can attain to it by the (proper) means.
6.36 It is not possible to attain Self-Realisation if a man does not know how to control himself; but for him who, striving by proper means, learns such control, it is possible.
6.36. My belief is that attaining Yoga is difficult for a man of uncontrolled self (mind); but it is possible to attain by [proper] means by a person who exerts with his subdued self.
6.36 In my opinion Yoga is hard to attain by a person of unrestrained mind. However, it can be attained through right means by him, who strives for it and has a subdued mind.
6.36 My conviction is that Yoga is difficult to be attained by one of uncontrolled mind. But it is possible to be attained through the (above) means by one who strives and has a controlled mind.
6.36 Yoga  is hard to attain even in spite of great efforts by one of unrestrained self, i.e., of unrestrained mind. But the same Yoga which is of the form of sameness of vision can be attained by proper means by one who is striving, whose 'mind is subdued,' i.e., by one whose mind is conered by works (Karma Yoga) taught before, which is of the nature of My worship and which includes within itself knowledge (Jnana).

Then Arjuna puts estions in order to hear the greatness of Yoga, as it really is, which he has already heard about at the beginning of the teaching, 'Here there is no loss of effort' (2.40). There the greatness of Karma Yoga as inclusive of knowledge of the self with Yoga as its culmination was taught. This alone is the real greatness of Yoga.
6.36 Asamyata - etc.  In do way whatsoever, is the Yoga attainable for a man with uncontrolled self  i.e.,  for a man without  desirelessness.  One, with subdued self :  one, with an attitude of desirelessness.  By him who exerts :  by him who has practice.  By means :  by undertaking the means enjoined in many scriptures of the Siddanta and the rest.
6.36 Me, My; matih, conviction; is iti, that; Yoga is dusprapah, difficult to be attained; asamyata-atmana, by one of uncontrolled mind, by one who has not controlled his mind, the internal organ, by practice and detachment. Tu, but, on the other hand; sakyah, Yoga is possible; avaptum, to be attained; yatata, by one who strives, who repeatedly makes effort; upayatah, through the means described above; and vasyatmany, by one of controlled mind, by him whose mind has been brought under control through practice and detachment.
As to that, by accepting the practice of Yoga, actions leading to the attainment of this or the next world may be renounced by a yogi, and yet he may not attain the result of perfection in Yoga, i.e. full Illumination, which is the means to Liberation. Conseently, at the time of death his mind may waver from the path of Yoga. Apprehending that he may be thery ruined.
6.37 Arjuna said  He who is unable to control himself though he has the faith, and whose mind wanders away from Yoga, what end does he, having failed to attain perfection in Yoga, mee,t O Krishna?
6.37 Arjuna asked: He who fails to control himself, whose mind falls from spiritual contemplation, who attains not perfection but retains his faith, what of him, my Lord?
6.37. Arjuna said  A person who has faith and is desirous of reaching the path (goal) of the good; [but] whose mind has  severed from the Yoga; to which goal does he go, having failed to attain the success in Yoga ?  O Krsna !
6.37 Arjuna said  If a person, who is possessed of faith but has put in only inadeate effort, finds his mind wandering away from Yoga, and then fails to attain perfection - what way does he go, O Krsna?
6.37 Arjuna said  O krsna, failing to achieve perfection in Yoga, what goal does one attain who, though possessed of faith, is not diligent and whose mind becomes deflected from Yoga?
6.37 - 6.39 Arjuna said  What way does he go, who has embarked on Yoga endowed with faith, but who by inadeacy of exertion in practice, does not gain success in Yoga and has his mind wandering from Yoga?  Does he not perish like a small piece of cloud torn from a large mass of cloud - perish without reaching another large mass of cloud?

Now does he not fall away from both (sides)?  He has no support and is confused on the path leading to the Brahman. He is without any support in the sense that Karma or rituals which constitutes the means of heaven etc., does not give support for a person who is devoid of attachment to fruits; for Karma is the means for generating its own fruits. He is also confused in the path leading to the Brahman on which he has just begun to traverse; He has lost his way. Does he then get lost by falling down from both sides, these being attainment of heaven on the one hand and liberation on the other. Does he not thus perish?  You should remove this doubt altogether from my mind; for there is no other remover of this doubt than You, who always perceive directly all matters simultaneously.
6.37 See Comment under 6.39
6.37 O krsna, aprapya, failing to achieve; yoga-sam-siddhim, perfection in Yoga, the result of Yoga, i.e. full Illumination; kam gatim, what goal; gacchati, does one attain; who, though upetah sraddhaya, possessed of faith, belief in God and in the other world; is ayatih, not diligent, devoid of effort on the path of Yoga; and, at the time of death, too, calita-manasah, whose mind becomes deflected; yogat, from Yoga, (i.e.) whose memory has been lost?
6.39 This doubt of mine, O Krishna, do Thou dispel completely; because it is not possible for any but Thee to dispel this doubt.
6.39 My Lord! Thou art worthy to solve this doubt once and for all; save Thyself there is no one competent to do so.
6.39. Please dispel this doubt of mine completely.  But for Yourself, O Krsna, no eradicator of this doubt is possible.
6.39 You should altogether remove this doubt of mine, O Krsna, for there  is no other remover of this doubt thanYou.
6.39 O Krsna, You should totally eradicate this doubt of mine. For, none other than Yourself can be the dispeller of this doubt!
6.37 - 6.39 Arjuna said  What way does he go, who has embarked on Yoga endowed with faith, but who by inadeacy of exertion in practice, does not gain success in Yoga and has his mind wandering from Yoga?  Does he not perish like a small piece of cloud torn from a large mass of cloud - perish without reaching another large mass of cloud?

Now does he not fall away from both (sides)?  He has no support and is confused on the path leading to the Brahman. He is without any support in the sense that Karma or rituals which constitutes the means of heaven etc., does not give support for a person who is devoid of attachment to fruits; for Karma is the means for generating its own fruits. He is also confused in the path leading to the Brahman on which he has just begun to traverse; He has lost his way. Does he then get lost by falling down from both sides, these being attainment of heaven on the one hand and liberation on the other. Does he not thus perish?  You should remove this doubt altogether from my mind; for there is no other remover of this doubt than You, who always perceive directly all matters simultaneously.
6.37-39 Ayatah  etc.  upto na hyupapadyate.  Even if his mind has moved away from the Yoga,  he had reached, the faith in  [his] mind is not lost.  for,  a person - even if he has  achieved the Yoga - makes  all  [achievements]  useless, if his faith is completely lost.  That has been said :-
 
'Even after attaining  the perfect knowledge,  if it gets vitiated due to the caprices of mind,  that very moment  it perishes soon, just as  a heap of  cotton does due to fire'.
 
If a complete success in the Yoga has not been achieved, then having  come out of  this  [material]  world, and having not yet got himself  absorbed in the Brahman, would he get lost ?  Or, because he has not yet got established in the Brahman, does he permanently  get  destroyed as the other world (heaven) is [also] ruined for him ?  This is the estion.							
 On this  [estion], the conclusion -
6.39 O krsna, arhasi, You should; asesatah, totally; chettum, eradicate, remove; etat, this; samsayam, doubt; me, of mine. Hi, for; na tvad anyah, none other than You, be he a sage or a god; upapadyate, can be; chetta, the despeller, the destroyer; asya, of this; samsayasya, doubt. Therefore you Yourself should dispel (the doubt). This is the meaning.
6.4 When a man is not attached to the sense-objects or to actions, having renounced all thoughts, then he is said to have attained to Yoga.
6.4 When a man renounces even the thought of initiating action, when he is not interested in sense objects or any results which may flow from his acts, then in truth he understands spirituality.
6.4. When, a person indulges himself neither in what is desired by the senses nor in the actions [for it], then [alone], being a man renouncing all intentions, he is said to have mounted on the Yoga.
6.4 For, when one loses attachment for the things of the senses and to actions, then has the abandoned all desires and is said to have climbed the heights of Yoga.
6.4 Verily, [Verily: This word emphasizes the fact that, since attachment to sense objects like sound etc. and to actions is an obstacle in the path of Yoga, therefore the removal of that obstruction is the means to its attainment.] when a man who has given up thought about everything does not get attached to sense-objects or acitons, he is then said to be established in Yoga.
6.4 When this Yogin, because of his natural disposition to the experience of the self, loses attachment, i.e., gets detached from sense-objects, i.e., things other than the self, and actions associated with them - then he has abandoned all desires and is said to have climbed the heights of Yoga. Therefore, for one wishing to climb to Yoga, but is still disposed to the experience of the sense-objects, Karma Yoga consisting of the practice of detachment to these objects, becomes the cause for success in Yoga. Therefore one who wishes to climb to Yoga must perform Karma Yoga consisting in the practice of detachment from sense-objects.

Sri Krsna further elucidates the same:
6.4 Yada etc.  What is desired by the senses :  Objects of senses. The actions for them :  actions such as earning the objects and so on.				
 In this  [path of]  knowledge one should be necessarily attentive.  This [the Lord] says-
6.4 Hi, verily; yada, when; a yogi who is concentrating his mind, sarva-sankalpa-sannyasi, who has given up thought about everything-who is apt to give up (sannyasa) all (sarva) thoughts (sankalpa) which are the causes of desire, for things here and hereafter; na anusajjate, does not become attached, i.e. does not hold the idea that they have to be done by him; indriya-arthesu, with regard to sense-objects like sound etc.; and karmasu, with regard to actions-nitya, naimittika, kamya and nisiddha (prohibited) because of the absence of the idea of their utility; tada, then, at that time; ucyate, he is said to be; yoga-arudhah, established in Yoga, i.e. he is said to have attained to Yoga.
From the expression, 'one who has given up thought about eveything', it follows that one has to renounce all desires and all actions, for all desires have thoughts as their source. This accords with such Smrti texts as:
'Verily, desire has thought as its source. Sacrifices arise from thoughts' (Ma. Sm. 2.3);
'O Desire, I know your source. You surely spring from thought. I shall not think of you. So you will not arise in me' (Mbh. Sa. 177.25).
And when one gives up all desires, renunciation of all actions becomes accomplished. This agrees with such Upanisadic texts as, '(This self is identified with desire alone.) What it desires, it resolves; what it resolves, it works out' (Br. 4.4.5); and also such Smrti texts as, 'Whatever actions a man does, all that is the effect of desire itself' (Ma. Sm. 2.4). It accords with reason also. For, when all thoughts are renounced, no one can even move a little. So, by the expression, 'one who has given up thought about everything', the Lord makes one renounced all desires and all actions.
When one is thus established in Yoga, then by that very fact one's self becomes uplifted by oneself from the worldly state which is replete with evils.
Hence,
6.40 The Blessed Lord said  O Arjuna, neither in this world, nor in the next world is there destruction for him; none, verily, who does good, O My son, ever comes to grief.
6.40 Lord Shri Krishna replied: My beloved child! There is no destruction for him, either in this world or in the next. No evil fate awaits him who treads the path of righteousness.
6.40. The Bhagavat said  O dear Partha !  Neither in this [world], nor in the other is there a destruction for him.  Certainly, no performer of an auspicious act does ever come to a grievous state.
6.40 The Lord said  Neither here (in this world) nor there (in the next), Arjuna, is there destruction for him. For, no one who does good ever comes to an evil end.
6.40 The Blessed Lord said  O Partha, there is certainly no ruin for him here or hereafter. For, no one engaged in good meets with a deplorable end, My son!
6.40 The Lord said  Neither here nor there is destruction for him who has begun Yoga with faith and has then fallen away from it. The meaning is that there is no destruction either in the form of failure of attainment of desires or in the form of Pratyavaya, which means the attainment of what is undesirable because of defects in the performance of works. Therefore no one who practises this incomparably auspicious Yoga ever comes to an evil end in the present, past or future.

Sri Krsna explains how this is so:
6.40 Partha etc.  The idea  [here]  is :  There is no  [estion of]  destruction for the fallen-from-Yoga,  either is this  world or in the other;  because his faith is not lost.  He has indeed  performed as auspicious  act of  seeking  the Bhagavat,  and that act is not of perishing nature as the Agnistoma  sacrifice etc., are.
6.40 O Partha, eva vidyate, there is certainly; na vinasah, no ruin; tasya, for him; iha, here, in this world; or amutra, hereafter, in the other world. Ruin means a birth inferior to the previous one; that is not there for one who has fallen from Yoga. Hi, for; na kascit, no one; kalyana-krt, engaged in good; gacchati, meets with; durgatim, a deplorable end; tata, My son! A father is called tata because he perpetuates himself (tanoti) through the son. Since the father himself becomes the son, therefore the son also is called tata. A disciple is called putra (son). [Sri krsna addressed Arjuna thus because the latter was his disciple.]
But what happens to him?
6.41 Having attained to the worlds of the righteous and having dwelt there for everlasting years, he who fell from Yoga is rorn in a house of the pure and wealthy.
6.41 Having reached the worlds where the righteous dwell, and having remained there for many years, he who has slipped from the path of spirituality will be born again in the family of the pure, benevolent and prosperous.
6.41. Having attained the worlds of performers of pious acts, [and] having resided there for years of Sasvata, the fallen-from-Yoga is born [again] in the house of the pure persons, who are rich.
6.41 He who has fallen away from Yoga is born again in the house of the pure and prosperous after having attained to the worlds of doers of good deeds and dwelt there for many long years.
6.41 Attaining the worlds of the righteous, and residing there for eternal years, the man fallen from Yoga is born in the house of the pious and the properous.
6.41 This person, who had wandered away from Yoga because of desire for whatever kind of enjoyments, he will gain those very enjoyments through the excellence of Yoga alone. Having attained to the worlds of those who do meritorious acts, he will dwell there for a long time, i.e., till his desire for such enjoyments gets exhausted. Then, devoid of desire for these enjoyment, this person who has swerved from Yoga at the very beginning of Yoga, is born, by virtue of the excellence of Yoga, in a family of those who are competent to practise Yoga.
6.41 Prapya  etc.  Of  Sasvata  of  Visnu  (personal god).  [His]  years :  three years of Visnu.  Of the pure persons :  of  those  whose mind is prone to touch  (to meditate upon)  the body  (amsa) of the Lord.
6.41 Prapya, attaining, reaching, lokan, the worlds; punya-krtam, of the righteous, of the performers of the Horse-sacrifice, etc.; and usitva, residing there, enjoying the stay; for sasvatih, eternal; samah, years; (then,) when the period of enjoyment is over, the yoga-bhrastah, man fallen from Yoga, the one who had set out on the path Yoga, i.e. a monk-as understood from the force of the context [From Arjuna's estion it minght appear that he was asking about the fate of people who fall from both the paths, viz that of Karma and of Meditation. But the possibility of getting ruined by performing actios (rites and duties) according to Vedic instructions does not arise, since their results are inevitable. However, the estion of ruin is relevant in the case of a monk, for on the one hand he has renounced actions, and on the other he may fail to attain perfection in Yoga in the present life. Hence, the Lord's answer relates to the fall and ruin of a monk alone.]; abhijayate, is born; gehe, in the house; sucinam, of the pious, who perform actions according to scriptural instructions; and srimatam, who are prosperous.
6.42 Or he is born in a family of even the wise Yogis; verily a birth like this is very difficult to obtain in this world.
6.42 Or, he may be born in the family of the wise sages, though a birth like this is, indeed, very difficult to obtain.
6.42. Or, he is born (rorn) nowhere other than in the family of the intelligent men of Yoga;  for, this birth is more difficult to get in the world.
6.42 Or he is born in a family of wise Yogins. But such a birth in this world is rarer to get.
6.42 Or he is born in the family of wise yogis [Persons possessing knowledge of Brahman. (S. concedes that some rare householders also can have this knowledge, and he cites the instances of Vasistha, Agastya, Janaka and Asvapati of olden days, and Vacaspati and the author of Khanada of recent times.)] only. Such a birth as is of this kind is surely more difficult to get in the world.
6.42 If one swerves from the right path at an advanced stage of Yoga, he will be born in a family of wise Yogins who practise Yoga and are themselves capable of teaching Yoga. Thus, these two types of birth - one in the family of those who are fit to practise Yoga and the other in that of accomplished Yogins - are hardly met with among common people in this world. But Yoga is of such great potentiality that even this rare blessing is achieved through it.
6.42 Atha  va  etc.  If  emancipation is destined to come to him by way of difference  (or in grades), then he is rorn nowhere but in a family of the men of Yoga.  That is why (the Lord)  says :  'For, this birth is more difficult ot get'.  Indeed in the house of the rich there are necessarily many obstacles.
6.42 Athava, or; bhavati, he is born; kule, in the family; dhimatam, of wise; yoginam, yogis; eva, only, who are poor-which is different from the family of the prosperous. Etat janma, such a birth; yat idrsam, as is of this kind-a birth that is in the family of poor yogis, in a family as described; is hi, surely; durlabha-taram, more difficult to get, as compared with the earlier one; loke, in the world.
Becuase,
6.43 Thee he comes in touch with the knowledge acired in his former body and strives more than before for perfection, O Arjuna.
6.43 Then the experience acquired in his former life will revive, and with its help he will strive for perfection more eagerly than before.
6.43. There in that life, he gains (regains) that link of mentality transmitted from his former body.  Conseently once again he strives for a full success, O rejoicer of the Kurus !
6.43 There he regains the disposition of mind which he had in his former body, O Arjuna, and from there he strives much more for success inYoga.
6.43 There he becomes endowed with that wisdom acired in the previous body. and he strives more than before for perfection, O scion of the Kuru dynasty.
6.43 - 6.44 There, in that existence, he regains the mental disposition for Yoga that he had in the previous birth. Like one awakened from sleep, he strives again from where he had left before attaining complete success. He strives so as not to be defeated by impediments. This person who has fallen away from Yoga is borne on towards Yoga alone by his previous practice, i.e., by the older practice with regard to Yoga. This power of Yoga is well known.

Even a person, who has not engaged in Yoga but has only been desirous of knowing Yoga, i.e., has failed to follow it up, acries once again the same desire to practise Yoga. He then practises Yoga, of which the first stage is Karma Yoga, and transcends Sabda-brahman (or Brahman which is denotable by words). The Sabda-brahman is the Brahman capable of manifesting as gods, men, earth, sky, heaven etc., namely, Prakrti. The meaning is that having been liberated from the bonds of Prakrti, he attains the self which is incapable of being named by such words as gods, men etc., and which comprises solely of knowledge and beatitude.

After thus describing the glory of Yoga the verse says:
6.43 See Comment under 6.45
6.43 Tatra, there, in the family of yogis; labhate, tam buddhisamyogam, he becomes endowed with that wisdom; paurva-dehikam, acired in the previous body. And yatate, he strives; bhuyah, more intensely; tatah, than before, more intensely than that tendency acired in the previous birth; samsiddau, for, for the sake of, perfection; kuru-nandana, O scion of the Kuru dynasty.
How does he become endowed with the wisdom acired in the previous body? That is being answered:
6.44 By that very former practice he is borne on in spite of himself. Even he who merely wishes to know Yoga goes beyond the Brahmic word.
6.44 Unconsciously he will return to the practices of his old life; so that he who tries to realise spiritual consciousness is certainly superior to one who only talks of it.
6.44. Being not a master of himself, he is dragged only by that former practice (its mental impression); only a seeker of the knowledge of the Yoga passes over what strengthens the [sacred] text.
6.44 By the power of his earlier practice, he is carried forward even against his will. Even though he is an enirer about Yoga, he transcends the Sabda-brahman i.e., Prakrti or matter.
6.44 For, by that very past practice, he is carried forward even in spite of himself! Even a seeker of Yoga transcends the result of the performance of Vedic rituals!
6.43 - 6.44 There, in that existence, he regains the mental disposition for Yoga that he had in the previous birth. Like one awakened from sleep, he strives again from where he had left before attaining complete success. He strives so as not to be defeated by impediments. This person who has fallen away from Yoga is borne on towards Yoga alone by his previous practice, i.e., by the older practice with regard to Yoga. This power of Yoga is well known.

Even a person, who has not engaged in Yoga but has only been desirous of knowing Yoga, i.e., has failed to follow it up, acries once again the same desire to practise Yoga. He then practises Yoga, of which the first stage is Karma Yoga, and transcends Sabda-brahman (or Brahman which is denotable by words). The Sabda-brahman is the Brahman capable of manifesting as gods, men, earth, sky, heaven etc., namely, Prakrti. The meaning is that having been liberated from the bonds of Prakrti, he attains the self which is incapable of being named by such words as gods, men etc., and which comprises solely of knowledge and beatitude.

After thus describing the glory of Yoga the verse says:
6.44 See Comment under 6.45
6.44 Hi, for; tena eva, by that very; purva-abhyasena, past practice-the powerful habit formed in the past life; hiryate, he, the yogi who had fallen from Yoga, is carried forward; avasah api, even inspite of himself. If he had not committed any act which could be characterized as unrigtheous etc. and more powerful than the tendency created by the practice of Yoga, then he is carried forward by the tendency created by the practice of Yoga. If he had committed any unrighteous act which was more powerful, then, even the tendency born of Yoga gets surely overpowered. But when that is exhausted, the tendency born of Yoga begins to take effect by itself. The idea is that it does not get destroyed, even though it may lie in abeyance over a long period.
Jijnasuh api, even a seeker; yogasya, of Yoga from the force of the context, the person implied is a monk who had engaged in the path of Yoga with a desire to known his true nature, but had falled from Yoga-; ;even he, ativartate, trascends-will free himself from; sabda-brahma, the result of the performance of Vedic ritual. What to speak of him who after understanding Yoga, may undertake it with steadfastness!
And why is the state of Yoga higher?
6.45 But the Yogi who strives with assiduity, purified of sins and perfected gradually through many births, reaches the highest goal.
6.45 Then after many lives, the student of spirituality, who earnestly strives, and whose sins are absolved, attains perfection and reaches the Supreme.
6.45. After that, the assiduously striving man of Yoga, having his sins completely cleansed and being perfected through many briths, reaches the Supreme Goal.
6.45 But the Yogin striving earnestly, cleansed of all his stains, and perfected through many births, reaches the supreme state.
6.45 However, the yogi, applying himself assiduously, becoming purified from sin and attaining perfection through many births, thery acheives the highest Goal.
6.45 Because of such excellence of Yoga, through accumulation of merit collected in many births the Yogin striving earnestly, becomes cleansed from stains. Having become perfected, he reaches the supreme state, even though he had once gone astray.

Sri Krsna now speaks of the superiority of the Yogin above all others because of his being devoted to the supreme goal of human existence.
6.43-45 Tatra  etc.  upto  param  gatim.  For a full success :  for emancipation. Being not a master of himself :  Indeed being exclusively under the control of other  [force],  he is forcibly driven towards the practice of Yoga by that  [mental  impression of his]  former practice.  This is not an ordinary  thing.  For, his act of passing over what  strengthens the  [sacred texual]  sound is only due to his desire for knowing the Yoga.  He passes over,  i.e.,  he does not undertake, what strengthens  the sound i.e.,  that which is of  the nature of  hymn-recitation  etc.  After that :  after  [the rise of]  desire for knowing  [Yoga].  Striving by method of practice,  he attains the Vasudevahood (identity with the  Surpeme)  at the time of destruction of  his body.  It should not be regarded that he has achieved success by [his pratice in] that single body gone.  Instead, it should be regarded that he had practised during  the course of many  a life-period.  Therefore, it may be conclude that the fallen-from-Yoga is he who craves continously for activities of  [attaining]  the Bhagavat by  abandoning all other activities.			
 The superiority (or importance) of the Yoga, [the Lord] describes:
6.45 The yogi, the man of Knowledge; yatamanah, applying himself; prayatnat, assiduously, i.e. striving more intensely; and as a result, samsuddha-kilbisah, becoming purified from sin; and aneka-janma-samsiddhah, attaining perfection through many births- gathering together tendencies little by little in many births, and attaining perfection through that totality of impressions acired in many births; tatah, thery coming to have full Illumination; yati, achieves; the param, highest, most perfect; ;gatim, Goal.
Since this is so, therefore.
6.46 The Yogi is thought to be superior to the ascetics and even superior to men of knowledge (obtained through the study of scriptures); he is also superior to men of action; therefore be thou a Yogi, O Arjuna.
6.46 The wise man is superior to the ascetic and to the scholar and to the man of action; therefore be thou a wise man, O Arjuna!
6.46. The man of Yoga is superior to the men of austerities and is considered superior even to the men of knowledge;  and the man of Yoga is superior to the men of action.  Therefore, O Arjuna !  you shall become a man of Yoga.
6.46 Greater than the austere, greater than those who possess knowledge, greater than the ritualists is the Yogin. Therefore, O Arjuna, become a Yogin.
6.46 A yogi is higher than men of austerity; he is considered higher even than men of knowledge. The yogi is also higher than men of action. Therefore, O Arjuna, do you become a yogi.
6.46 Whatever end of human endeavour is attained by mere austerity, by knowledge of different subjects (i.e., different from experience of the self) and by mere rituals like the horse-sacrifice etc.,  greater than all these is the end achieved through Yoga. Conseently the Yogin is superior to those who practise austerity, to those who possess learning and to those who perform rituals. Therefore, O Arjuna, become a Yogin.

Thus, so far the vision of the self, which has been expounded in the teaching of Prajapati as forming a part of supreme Vidya, has been taught; then Sri Krsna extols that supreme Vidya:
6.46  Tapasvibhyah  etc.  The superiority  [of  Yogin]  over the men of austerities has already been indicated.  The knowledge is the fruit of Yoga.  Hence Yogin's  superiority over the men of  knowledge. He is superior to men of action, because he alone knows how to perform action.	
 The God-discarding difficult Yoga, does not itself yield success. This is stated [as]-
6.46 A yogi is adhikah, higher; tapasvibhyah, than men of austerity; he is matah, considered; adhikah, higher than, superior to; api, even; jnanibhyah, men of knowledge. Jnana here means scriptural learning. (A yogi is superior) to even those who possess that (learning). The yogi is adhikah, higher, greater; karmibhyah, than men of action-karma means Agnihotra etc.; (greater) than those who adhere to them. Since this is so, tasmat, therefore; O Arjuna, bhava, do you become a yogi.
6.47 And among all the Yogis he who, full of faith and with his inner self merged in Me, worships Me is deemed by Me to be the most devout.
6.47 I look upon him as the best of mystics who, full of faith, worshippeth Me and abideth in Me."
6.47. He, who has faith and serves Me with his inner self gone to Me, he is considered by  Me as the best master of Yoga, among all the men of Yoga.
6.47 He who with faith worships Me, whose inmost self is fixed in Me, I consider him as the greatest of the Yogins.
6.47 Even among all the yogis, he who adores Me with his mind fixed on Me and with faith,he is considered by Me to be the best of the yogis.
6.47 'Yoginam', which is the genitive case, has to be taken in the sense of the ablative. In the verses beginning with, 'He sees the self as abiding in all beings' (6.29), Yogins at four degrees of attainment have been mentioned. Since the Yogin who is now mentioned in this passage cannot be included in the four types mentioned earlier, the genitive case specifying one out of many will be inappropriate here.

In 'api sarvesam,' those who practise austerities etc., are referred to by the word 'sarva' (all). According to the principle set forth, here also the case ending has to be taken as ablative. The meaning therefore is that the Yogin who is now referred to, is the most integrated compared with those mentioned earlier and all other types. Compared to this Yogin, the differences in point of superiority and inferiority among the other Yogins such as the performers of austerities etc., are of no significance like mustard-seeds compared to Mount Meru. Even though there exists smallness and bigness in relation to one another among mustard-seeds, still when compared to Meru, such distinctions among them have no significance, as they are all small compared to Meru.

I consider him the most integrated who, with his innermost self, has his mind fixed on Me, on account of My being the only object of his overflowing love and also on account of his having a nature which cannot be supported by anything other than Myself; who has 'faith,' i.e., who strives rapidly to attain Me because of his being unable to bear a moment's separation from Me on account of My being very dear to him; and who 'worships Me,' i.e., serves Me with devotion and meditates on Me - Me whose sportive delight brings about the origination, sustentation and dissolution of the entire cosmos filled with multifarious and innumerable objects of enjoyment, enjoyers, means and places of enjoyment; who is untouched by any evil without exception; whose divine figure is the treasue-house of innumerable multitudes of auspicious, unlimited and unsurpassed attributes such as knowledge, power, lordship, energy, potency and splendour; whose divine figure is the treasure-house of infinite, unsurpassed attributes agreeable and highly worthy, such as radiance, beauty, fragrance, tenderness, pervading sweetness and youthfulness which are uniform, inconceivable and divine, wondrous, eternal and flawless; whose essential nature and alities transcend all thought and words; who is the great ocean of compassion, condescension, paternal love and beauty; who is the impartial refuge of all beings without exception and without considerations of any difference; who is the reliever of the distress of supplicants; who is the great, unfathomable ocean of affection for supplicants; who has become visible to the eyes of all men without abandoning His essential nature; who has incarnated in the house of Vasudeva; who has made the entire would illumined with His limitless and excellent glory; and who has satisfied the entire universe with the impeccable glory of beauty.

The idea is that I, who by Myself alone see all things directly as they are, look upon him, the last mentioned type of Yogi here, as superior to all other types mentioned earlier.
6.47 Yoginam etc.  He, who establishes Me in his internal organ; who is totally addicted to devotion and faith and who serves i.e., internally experiences Me alone, and not anything else,  following the method of tradition, learnt by rendering service to the revered teachers-he alone among all the Yogins, is the best master of the Yoga  i.e.,  one who is fully absorbed in the Supreme Lord.  Thus the superiority of the Yoga with Godly knowledge over all [other means] has been explained.
6.47 Api, even; sarvesam yoginam, among all the yogis, among those who are immersed in meditation on Rudra, Aditya, and others; yah, he who; bhajate, adores; mam, Me; antaratmana,with his mind; madgatena, fixed on Me, concentrated on Me who am Vasudeva; and sraddhavan, with faith, becoming filled with faith; sah, he; is matah, considered; me, by Me; to be yukta-tamah, the best of the yogis, engaged in Yoga most intensely. [It has been shown thus far that Karma-yoga has monasticism as its ultimate culmination. And in the course of expounding Dhyana-yoga together with its ausxiliaries, and instructing about the means to control the mind, the Lord rules out the possibility of absolute ruin for a person fallen from Yoga. He has also stated that steadfastness in Knowledge is for a man who knows the meaning of the word tvam (thou) (in 'Thou are That'). All these instructions amount to declaring that Liberation comes from the knowledge of the great Upanisadic saying, 'Thou art That.']
6.5 One should raise oneself by one's Self alone; let not one lower oneself; for the Self alone is the friend of oneself, and the Self alone is the enemy of oneself.
6.5 Let him seek liberation by the help of his Highest Self, and let him never disgrace his own Self. For that Self is his only friend; yet it may also be his enemy.
6.5. Let a person lift the Self by self and let him not depress the Self.  For, the self alone is the friend of the Self and self alone is the foe of the Self.
6.5 One should raise the self by his own mind and not allow the self to sink; for the mind alone is the friend of the self, and the mind alone is the foe of the slef.
6.5 One should save oneself by oneself; one should not lower oneself. For oneself is verily one's onw friend; oneself is verily one's own enemy.
6.5 By the self (Atman), i.e., by the mind, which is unattached to sense-objects, one should raise the self. One should not allow the self to sink by a mind which is of the contrary kind. 'For the self alone,' i.e., the mind alone is the friend of the self; and it alone is the foe of the self. [The figure of speech here is of Samsara as the ocean in which the individual self is like an object with liability to sink. What causes its sinking is the lingering attachments of the mind to some objects, though in the discipline of Jnana Yoga one may keep aloof from such objects. A mind with such attachments is the foe and without them, the friend.]
6.5 See Comment under 6.6
6.5 Uddharet, one should save; atmanam, oneself sunk in the sea of the world; atmana, by oneself; one should save, ut-haret, should uplift (oneself) from that, i.e. make it attain the state of being established in Yoga. Na avasadayet, one should not lower, dase; atmanam, oneself. Hi, for; atma eva, oneself is verily; atmanah one's own; bandhuh, friend. Centainly there is no other friend who can bring about liberation from this world. In fact, even a friend is an obstacle to Liberation, he being the source of such bondages as love etc. Therefore the emphatic statement, 'For one is one's own friend, is justifiable.
Atma eva, oneself verily; is atmanah, one's own: ripuh, enemy. Anyone else who is an external harmful enemy, even he is of one's own making! Therefore the firm conclusion, 'oneself verily is one's own enemy's is reasonable.
It has been said that 'oneself is verily one's own friend, oneself verily is one's own enemy.' As to that, (the self) [Ast. has this additional word, atma, self.-Tr.] of what kind is one's own friend, or (the self) of what kind is one's own enemy? This is being answered:
6.6 The Self is the friend of the self of him by whom the self has been conered by the Self, but to the unconered self, this Self stands in the position of an enemy, like an (external) foe.
6.6 To him who has conquered his lower nature by Its help, the Self is a friend, but to him who has not done so, It is an enemy.
6.6. The self is the friend of that Self by Which the self has been verily subdued; but [in the case of] a person with an unsubdued self, the self alone would abide in enmity like an enemy.
6.6 The mind is the friend of him by whom the mind has been conered. But for him whose mind is not conered, the mind, like an enemy, remains hostile.
6.6 Of him, by whom has been conered his very self by the self, his self is the friend of his self. But, for one who has not conered his self, his self itself acts inimically like an enemy.
6.6 A person whose mind is conered by himself in relation to sense-objects, has that mind as his friend. In the case of one whose mind is not conered in this way, his own mind, like an enemy, remains hostile. The meaning is that it acts, against his attainment of supreme beatitude. It has been stated by Bhagavan Parasara also:  'The mind of man is the cause both of his bondage and his release. Its addiction to sense objects is the cause of his bondage; its separation from sense objects is the means of one's release' (V. P., 6.7.28).

The proper condition for the beginning of Yoga is now taught:
6.5-6 Uddharet etc. Bandhuh etc.  In this  [path] there is no other means excepting the self  i.e. nothing but one's mind.  Indeed the subdued mind is a friend and it lifts up  [the Self] from the highly dreadful  cycle of  birth  and death.  But the unsubdued one does the act of enmity as it throws  [the Self] down in the horrible hell.										
 The characteristic mark of the subdued-minded man is this :
6.6 Tasya, of him; yena, by whom; jitah, has been conered, subdued; his eva atma, very self, the aggregate of body and organs; that atma, self; is bandhuh, the friend; atmanah, of his self. The idea is that he is a coneror of his senses. Tu, but; anatmanah, for one who has not conered his self, who has no self-control; atma eva, his self itself; varteta, acts; satruvat, like an enemy; satrutve, inimically, with the attitude of an enemy. As an enemy, who is different from oneself, does harm to oneself, similarly one's self behaves like an enemy to oneself. This is the meaning. [If the body and organs are under control, they are helpful in concentrating one's mind on the Self; but, if they are not under control, they oppose this concentration.]
6.7 The Supreme Self of him who is self-controlled and peaceful is balanced in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, as also in honour and dishonour.
6.7 The Self of him who is self-controlled, and has attained peace is equally unmoved by heat or cold, pleasure or pain, honour or dishonour.
6.7. The thinking of the person, with subdued mind and [hence] with complete calmness,  remains in eilibrium in the case of others and of himself,  in cold and heat, in pleasure and pain, like-wise in honour and dishonour.
6.7 Of him whose mind is conered and who is serene, the great self is well secured in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honour and dishonour.
6.7 The supreme Self of one who has control over the aggregate of his body and organs, and who is tranil, becomes manifest. (He should be eipoised) [These words are supplied to complete the sentence.] in the midst of cold and heat, happiness and sorrow, as also honour and dishonour.
6.7 Of him whose self is conered, i.e., whose mind is conered, whose mind is free from fluctuations and who is very calm, 'the great self' becomes well secured, i.e., exceedingly well secured in connection with heat and cold, pleasure and pain, and honour and dishonour.

Here the individual self (Pratyagatman) is called 'the great self' (Paramatman), as the context justifies this only. It can also be called 'great', because it is at a higher stage relatively to previous successive stages. Or the word may be construed as follows:  The self is secured greatly - Atma parma samahitah. [In any case it should not be taken as the Supreme Being].
6.7 Jita-etc.  A person with complete calmness :  a person without ego.  [The thinking etc.] ;  A thinking that entertains no difference in the case of others and of himself,  and of cold and heat etc., i.e.,  [entertains] no like and dislike [for them].
6.7 Parama-atma, the supreme Self; jita-atmanah, of one who has control over the aggregate of his body and organs; prasantasya, who is tranil, who is a monk with his internal organ placid; samahitah, becomes manifest, i.e. becomes directly manifest as his own Self. Moreover, (he should be eipoised) sita-usna-sukha-duhkhesu, in the midst of cold and heat, happiness and sorrow; tatha, as also; mana-apamanayoh in honour and dishonour, adoration and despise.
6.8 The Yogi who is satisfied with the knowledge and the wisdom (of the Self), who has conered the senses, and to whom a clod of earth, a piece of stone and gold are the same, is said to be harmonied (i.e., is said to have attained Nirvikalpa Samadhi).
6.8 He who desires nothing but wisdom and spiritual insight, who has conquered his senses and who looks with the same eye upon a lump of earth, a stone or fine gold, is a real saint.
6.8. He, whose self (mind) is satisfied with knowledge and with what consists of varied thoughts; who remains peak-like and has completely subdued his sense organs;  and to whom a clod, a stone and a piece of gold are the same-that man of  Yoga is called a master of Yoga.
6.8 The Yogin whose mind is content with knowledge of the self and also of knowledge of the difference of the self from Prakrti, who is established in the self, whose senses are subdued and to whom earth, stone and gold seem all alike, is called integrated.
6.8 One whose mind is satisfied with knowledge and realization, who is unmoved, who has his organs under control, is sadi to be Self-absorbed. The yogi treats eally a lump of earth, a stone and gold.
6.8 That Karma Yogin whose mind is content with the knowledge of the self and the knowledge of the difference, i.e., whose mind is content with the knowledge concerning the real nature of the self as well as with the knowledge of the difference of Its nature from Prakrti; 'who is established in the self' (Kutasthah), i.e., who remains as the self which is of the uniform nature of knowledge in all stages of evolution as men, gods etc. whose senses are therefore subdued; and to whom 'earth, stone and gold are of eal value' because of his lack of interest in any material objects of enjoyment on account of his intense earnestness to know the real nature of the self as different from Prakrti - he, that Karma Yogi, is called integrated i.e., fit for the practice of Yoga which is of the nature of the vision of the self.

And also.
6.8 Jnana - etc.  Knowledge :  a knowledge which is different from the false one. What consists of varied thoughts :  the action in which varied  thoughts  are involved, i.e. the action that is born as result of preceding thoughts of reasoning.
6.8 A yogi, jnana-vijnana-trpta-atma, whose mind is satisfied with knowledge and realization-jnana is thorough knowledge of things presented by the scriptures, but vijnana is making those things known from the scriptures a subject of one's own realization just as they have been presented; he whose mind (atma) has become contented (trpta) with those jnana and vijnana is jnana-vijnana-trpta-atma-; kutasthah, who is unmoved, i.e. who becomes unshakable; and vijita-indriyah, who has his organs under control;- he who is of this kind, ucyate, is said to be; yuktah, Self-absorbed. That yogi sama-losta-asma-kancanah, treats eally a lump of earth, a stone and gold.
Further,
6.9 He who is of the same mind to the good-hearted, friends, enemies, the indifferent, the neutral, the hateful, the relatives, the righteous and the unrighteous, excels.
6.9 He looks impartially on all - lover, friend or foe; indifferent or hostile; alien or relative; virtuous or sinful.
6.9. He whose mind is eal in the case of the friend, companion, enemy, the indifferent one, the one who remains in the middle, the foe, the relative, the righteous and also the sinful-he excells [all].
6.9 He who regards with an eal eye well-wishers, friends, foes, the indifferent, neutrals, the hateful, the relations, and even the good and the sinful - he excels.
6.9 He excels who has sameness of view with regard to a benefactor, a friend, a foe [Ari (foe) is one who does harm behind one's back.], a neutral, an arbiter, the hateful, [Dvesyah is one who openly hateful.] a relative, good people and even sinners.
6.9 'Well-wishers' (Suhrt) are those who wish one well, regardless of differences in age. 'Friends' (Mitra) are well-wisheres of eal age. 'Foes' (Ari) are those who wish ill to one because of some particular cause. 'The indifferent' (Udasina) are those devoid of both friendship and hostility because of the absence of causes for both; 'neutrals' (Madhyastha) are those who are by their very nature incapable of both friendship and hostility. 'The hateful' are those who wish ill to one even from birth. 'Relations' are those who bear goodwill from birth. 'The good' are those devoted to virtue. 'The sinful' are those given to sin. Because of the self being the only end of Yoga, and because of there being no gain and no opposition from well-wishers, friends, etc., he who could regard them all with an eal eye as selves, excels in respect of fitness for the practice of Yoga.
6.9 Suhrt etc.  Friend is one whose heart remains good  and auspicious without cause  (on its own accord).  Companionship is  [that which is felt] mutually.  Enmity is  [also that which is felt] between one another.  The indifferent one :  the one, who is free from both these.  One who remains in the middle :  he who is partly a friend and  partly an enemy. Foe : he who deserves to be hated,  [but] cannot be hated.  Relative : the one [connected] by marital  bondage.  Whosoever is with his mind eal to all these as well as  to the righteous and the sinful; he excells  [all]  i.e.,  stage after stage he goes out of the cycle of birth-and-death.		
 By the worshipful-footed persons of this sort -
6.9 The first line of the verse beginning with 'benefactor,' etc. is a single compound word.
Visisyate, he excels, i.e. he is the best among all those who are established in Yoga-(a different reading is vimucyate, he becomes free); sama-buddhih, who has sameness of view, i.e. whose mind is not engaged with the estion of who one is and what he does; with regard to a suhrd, benefactor-one who does some good without consideration of return; mitram, a friend, one who is affectionate; arih, a foe; udasinah, a neutral, who sides with nobody; madhyasthah, an arbiter, who is a well-wisher of two conflicting parties; dvesyah, the hateful, who is repulsive to oneself; bandhuh, a relative;- to all these as also sadhusu, with regard to good people, who follow the scriptures; api ca, and even; papesu, sinners, who perform prohibited actions-with regard to all of them.
Therefore, to acire this excellent result-
7.1 The Blessed Lord said  O Arjuna, hear how you shall without doubt know Me fully, with the mind intent on Me, practising Yoga and taking refuge in Me.
7.1 "Lord Shri Krishna said: Listen, O Arjuna! And I will tell thee how thou shalt know Me in my Full perfection, practising meditation with thy mind devoted to Me, and having Me for thy refuge.
7.1. The Bhagavat said  O son of Prtha, hear [from Me]  how, having your mind attached to Me,  practising Yoga  and taking refuge in Me, you shall understand Me fully, without any doubt.
7.1 The Lord said  With your mind focussed on Me, having Me for your support and practising Yoga - how you can without doubt know Me fully, hear, O Arjuna.
7.1 The Blessed Lord said  O Partha, hear how you, having the mind fixed on Me, practising the Yoga of Meditation and taking refuge in Me, will know Me with certainly and in fulness.
7.1 The Lord said  Listen attentively to My words imparting knowledge to you, by which you will understand Me indubitably and fully - Me, the object of the Yogic contemplation in which you are engaged with a mind so deeply bound to Me by virtue of overwhelming love that it would disintegrate instantaneously the moment it is out of touch with My essential nature, attributes, deeds and glories, and with your very self resting so completely on Me that it would break up when bereft of Me.
7.1 See comment under 7.2
7.1 O Partha, mayi asaktamanah, having the mind fixed on Me- one whose mind (manah) is fixed (asakta) on Me (mayi) who am the supreme God possessed on the alification going to be spoken of-.
Yogam yunjan, practising the Yoga of Meditation, concentrating the mind-.
Madasrayah, taking refuge in Me-one to whom I Myself, the supreme Lord, am the refuge (asraya) is madasrayah-.
Anyone who hankers after some human objective resorts to some rite such as the Agnihotra etc., austerity or charity, which is the means to its attainment. This yogi, however, accepts only Me as his refuge; rejecting any other means, he keeps his mind fixed on Me alone.
Srnu, hear; tat, that, which is being spoken of by Me; as to yatha, how, the process by which; you who, having become thus, jnasyasi, will know; mam, Me; asamsayam, with certainty, without doubt, that the Lord is such indeed; and samagram, in fullness, possessed of such alities as greatness, strength, power, majesty, etc. [Strength-physical; power-mental; etc. refers to omniscience and will.] in their fullness.
7.10 Know Me, O Arjuna, as the eternal seed of all beings; I am the intelligence of the intelligent; the splendour of the splendid objects am I.
7.10 Know, O Arjuna, that I am the eternal Seed of being; I am the Intelligence of the intelligent, the Splendour of the resplendent.
7.10. O son of Prtha !  Know Me as the eternal seed of all beings;  I am the intellect of the intellectuals and the brillinace of the brilliant.
7.10 Know Me to be, O Arjuna, the primeval seed of all beings. I am the intelligence of the discerning, and the brilliance of the brilliant.
7.10 O Partha, know Me to be the eternal Seed of all beings. I am the intellect of the intelligent, I am the courage of the courageous.
7.8 - 7.11 All these entities with their peculiar characteristic are born from Me alone. They depend on Me; inasmuch as they constitute My body, they exist in Me alone. Thus I alone exist while all of them are only My modes.
7.10 See Comment under 7.11
7.10 O Partha, viddhi, know, mam, Me; to be the sanatanam, eternal; bijam, seed, the source of growth; sarva-bhutanam, of all beings. Besides, I am the buddhih, intellect, the power of discrimination of the mind; buddhimatam, of the intelligent, of people having the power of discrimination. I am the tejah, courage; tejasvinam, of the courageous, of those possessed of that.
7.11 Of the strong, I am the strength devoid of desire and attachment, and in (all) beings, I am the desire unopposed to Dharma, O Arjuna.
7.11 I am the Strength of the strong, of them who are free from attachment and desire; and, O Arjuna, I am the Desire for righteousness.
7.11. Of the strong, I am the strength that is free from desire and attachment.  O best of the Bharatas,  in [all]  beings I am the desire which is not opposed to attributes.
7.11 In the strong, I am strength, devoid of desire and passion. In all beings, I am the desire which is not forbidden by law (Dharma), O Arjuna.
7.11 And of the strong I am the strength which is devoid of passion and attachment. Among creatures I am desire which is not contrary to righteousness, O scion of the Bharata dyansty.
7.8 - 7.11 All these entities with their peculiar characteristic are born from Me alone. They depend on Me; inasmuch as they constitute My body, they exist in Me alone. Thus I alone exist while all of them are only My modes.
7.10-11 Bijam etc.  Balam etc.  The seed :  the subtle  prime cause.  The strength, free from desire and attachment :  It is of the nature of vigour and is capable of supporting all that exist.  Deire :  the Will,  which is nothing but  Pure Consciousness and which  is not opposed to any of the attributes   (its objects)  like pot, cloth etc. For, the Will, because it is the [conscious] energy of the Bhagavat, is immanent in all and  nowhere is it  opposed, eventhough it is being  differentiated  (i.e. the wills or desires are classified)  on account of its attributes  like  pot,  cloth etc., which are  [only]  accidental. Thus the wise,  because they are devoted to this Will, are of the nature  of  Pure  Consciousness.  That has been said also in the Sivopanisad as -
 
   '[A man of wisdom]  would  concentrate his mind on 
    the Will or  [Self]  Consciousness that arises'.  (VB, 98) 
 
[Here in this otation]  that arises means 'that  has just risen but has not yet spread outside.'
 
Ignoring this way of interpretation  [of the Gita passage] some interpret it so as to bring  out the idea  'He would enjoy the group of the three, not hindering mutually'.  These  (commentators)  are ignorant of the customs  (karma) sanctioned by the traditions; yet they interpret the secret about the Absolute !  No doubt they deserve  [our] salutation.
7.11 I am the balam, strength, ability, virility; balavatam, of the strong. That strength, again, is kama-raga-vivarjitam, devoid of passion and attachment. Kamah is passion, hankering for things not at hand. Ragah is attachment, fondness for things acired. I am the strength that is devoid of them and is necessary merely for the maintenance of the body etc., but not that strength of the worldly which causes hankering and attachment.
Further, bhutesu, among creatures; I am that kamah, desire-such desires as for eating, drinking, etc. which are for the mere maintenance of the body and so on; which is dharma-aviruddhah, not contrary to righteousness, not opposed to scriptural injunctions; bharatarsabha, O scion of the Bharata dynasty.
Moreover,
7.12 Whatever beings (and objects) that are pure, active and inert, know that they proceed from Me. They are in Me, yet I am not in them.
7.12 Whatever be the nature of their life, whether it be pure or passionate or ignorant, they are all derived from Me. They are in Me, but I am not in them.
7.12. Whatever beings are there [in the universe]-whether they are of the Sattva or of Rajas or of Tamas  (Strands)- be sure that they are from Me; I am not in them, but they are in Me.
7.12 Know that all those states of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are from Me alone. But I am not in them; they are in Me.
7.12 Those things that indeed are made of (the ality of ) sattva, and those things that are made of (the ality of) rajas and tamas, know them to have sprung from Me alone. However, I am not in them; they are in Me!
7.12 Why should this be declared with particular illustrations?  The reason is as follows:  Whatever entities exist in the world partaking of the alities of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas in the forms of bodies, senses, objects of enjoyment and their causes - know them all to have originated from Me alone, and they abide in Me alone, as they constitute My body. 'But I am not in them.' That is, I do not depend for My existence on them at any time. In the case of other beings, though the body depends for its existence on the self, the body serves some purpose of the self in the matter of Its sustenance. To Me, however, there is no purpose at all of that kind served by them constituting My body. The meaning is that they merely serve the purpose of My sport.
7.12 See Comment under 7.13
7.12 Ye bhavah, those things; sattvikah eva, that indeed are made of (the ality of) sattva; and ye rajasah, those that are made (of the ality) of rajas; and tamasah, those that are made of (the ality of) tamas-whatever things are made (of sattva, rajas and tamas) according to the creatures's own actions: viddhi, know; tan, them, all without exception; mattah eva iti, to have sprung from Me alone when they come into being. Although they originate from Me, still, tu, however; aham, I; am na tesu, not in them-I am not subject to them, not under their control, as are the transmigrating bengs. Te, they, again; mayi, are in Me, subject to Me, under My control. [For sattva, rajas, and tamas see note under 2.45 as also Chapters 14, 17 and 18.-Tr.]
'The world does not know Me, the supreme Lord, even though I am of this kind, and am eternal, pure, intelligent and free by nature, [See note on p.4.-Tr.] the Self of all beings, free from all alities, the cause of burning away the seed of the evil of transmigration!'-in this way the Lord expresses regret. And what is the source of that ignorance in the world? That is being stated:
7.13 Deluded by these Natures (states or things) composed of the three alities of Nature all this world does not know Me as distinct from them and immutable.
7.13 The inhabitants of the world, misled by those natures which the Qualities have engendered, know not that I am higher than them all, and that I do not change.
7.13. Being duluded by these three beings of the Strands, this entire world does not recognise Me Who am eternal and transcending these [Strands].
7.13 The entire universe is deluded by these three states originating from the Gunas (of Prakrti), and fails to recognise Me, who am beyond them and immutable.
7.13 All this world, deluded as it is by these three things made of the gunas (alities), does not know Me who am transcendental to these and undecaying.
7.13 Now, in this way, the whole universe, consisting of animate and inanimate entities belonging to Me, evolves from time to time from Me only, is absorbed in Me, and abides in Me alone. It constitutes My body and has Me for its self. Whether in the causal state or in the state of effect, it is I who have all these entities as My modes, because all entities form My body. Thus, in regard to all these modes, I am superior to them, as I am their cause, principal, and as I possess a complex of countless auspicious attributes like knowledge, strength etc. In every way I remain as the highest being. There exists none higher than Myself.

Such being the case, I am superior to these entities composed of the alities of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas - superior to them by My extraordinary attributes and by having these various modes for My enjoyment. I am the highest and immutable, i.e., I form a unity in Myself. This world constituted of gods, men, animals and immovables, and deluded by the three Gunas of Prakrti and its evolutes are inferior and transient. The forms of bodies, senses and objects of enjoyment comprising the world are there in accordance with their past Karmas. No one in the world knows Me.

How is it possible that all experiencing beings think as enjoyable objects which are inferior, constituted of the Gunas and are transient, while You exist - You who are of the nature of unbounded and abundant bliss, who has an eternal unchanging form and who is the source of the enjoyableness of even the objects of the world?  Sri Krsna replies:
7.12-13 Ye ca  etc.  Tribhih etc.  The [Strands]  Sattva etc., are derived from Me, and not I from them.  That is why he who has achieved his identity with the Bhagavat  (the  Absolute),  properly realises all [objects]  as being the Bhagavat  [Himself].  On the other hand, the person who is established in the knowledge of objects of umpteen varieties does not understand  the reality of the Bhagavat. This krama  (traditional order)  pleases the mind of all.  With this idea only the Lord is going to declare presently  'Vasudeva is all'.   There the meaning is this :  He, whose internal organ is favoured by the  descent  of the Supreme  Energy  or grace  (Sakti-pata)  that arises after [teaching the stage of]  eableness of effects of actions (karma-samata) that is  brought about by the enjoyment  [of effects] through many births;  and who realises the reality of Bhagavat, with conviction  'verily all is Vasudeva' - that person is the great Soul and he is difficult to find.  But, not knowing in this manner and,  on the contrary, being duluded by the Strands,  Sattva etc., this  world, fails to perceive the reality of Vasudeva, transcending the Strands.							
 [The Lord]  declares why  the persons established exclusively in the Sattva etc.  (Strands), are not conscious of the real nature of the Bhagavat :
7.13 Sarvam, all; idam, this; jagat, world, the aggregate of creatures; mohitam, deluded as it is-made to have indiscrimination; hih, by these; aforesaid tribhih, three; bhavaih, things, in the forms of attachment, repulsion, delusion, etc; and gunamayaih, made of the gunas, of the transformations of the gunas; na abhijanati, does not know; mam, Me; who am param, transcendental to, distinct, different; hyah, from these gunas as referred to above; and am avyayam, undecaying, i.e. free from all (the six kinds of) changes in things, viz birth etc. [See note on p.38.-Tr.]
How, again, do they cross over this divine Maya of Visnu, constituted by the three gunas? That is being stated:
7.14 Verily, this divine illusion of Mine, made up of the (three) alities (of Nature) is difficult to cross over; those who take refuge in Me alone, cross over this illusion.
7.14 Verily, this Divine Illusion of Phenomenon manifesting itself in the Qualities is difficult to surmount. Only they who devote themselves to Me and to Me alone can accomplish it.
7.14. This is My play  (daivi), trick-of-Illusion composed of the Strands and is hard to cross over.  Those, who resort to Me alone-they cross over the trick-of-Illusion.
7.14 (a) For this divine Maya or Mine consisting of the three Gunas (assumed for purposes of sport) is hard to overcome৷৷.

(b) ৷৷. But those who take refuge in Me (Prapadyante) alone shall pass beyond the Maya.
7.14 Since this divine Maya of Mine which is constituted by the gunas is difficult to cross over, (therefore) those who take refuge in Me alone cross over this Maya.
7.14 (a) This Maya of Mine consists of the three Gunas, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Because it is created by Me, the Divine, for purpose of sport, it is divine in its power and therefore difficult to overcome.

The word Maya is used for the effects of the three Gunas, because it has got the power of generating wonderful effects as in the case of the magic of Asuras and Raksasas. See the passages:  'Then the excellent discus, the flaming Sudarsana, was despatched by the Lord to defend the boy. The thousand Mayas or wonderfully created weapons of the evil-designed Sambara were foiled one after another, by that ickly moving discus, for protecting the body of the boy' (V. P., 1.19. 19-20).

Here the term Maya does not signify the sense of 'false'. Even with regard to magicians, when the term, Mayavin (one who possesses Maya) is used, there is origination of real impressions with the aid of certain incantations, herbs etc., though the objects created are illusory things. Accordingly the term Maya denotes the incantations, herbs etc., which have got the power of creating real impressions. Inasmuch as the sense of the term should be invariable, following the usage in all cases, the term Maya can be applied to the illusory objects, only in a secondary sense, while its primary sense in regard to the real impressions generated in the mind. It is just like in the statement 'The cots cry.'

The Maya of the Lord, which is absolutely real and which consists of the Gunas, is alone taught in the texts like, 'Know then Maya to be the Prakrti and the possessor of the Maya to be the great Lord' (Sve. U., 4.10). It not only obscures the essential nature of the Lord but also creates the condition of the mind that sees its objects as enjoyable. Therefore, the entire universe, deluded by the Lord's Maya, does not know the Lord who is of the nature of boundless beatitude. (On the other hand they feel objects set forth by Maya as enjoyable).

Sri Krsna teaches the way of deliverance from Maya:

(b) But those who take refuge in Me alone - Me whose resolves are always true, who has supreme compassion, and who is the refuge of all beings without exception and without consideration of their particular status - such persons shall pass beyond this Maya of Mine consisting of the three Gunas. The meaning is that they worship Me alone, renouncing the Maya.

Why, then do all not take recourse to refuge in the Lord which is conducive to the worship of the Lord?
7.14 Daivi  etc.  Deva  means  'one who plays'.  What is born of  (or exists in)  him is daivi  'play'.  Hence, the meaning is :  'This is My play'.  Due to this [play-trick],  the  [Strands]  Sattva etc.,  even though they are not really different  from the Supreme Brahman,  the Pure Consciousness, manifest as different  from That.  This  [differentiation] itself  accounts for their  secondary nature i.e.,  the nature of being an object of enjoyment i.e.,  being dependent on the existence of the enjoyer. This peculiarity of dual-nature is inexplicable for the persons of mundane life.  Hence to them it is a trick-of-Illusion. Therefore, those who have realised the light of the Brahman,  the Supreme Reality, and find the universe as not distinct from that  [Brahman],  they  [alone]  cross over the trick-off-Illusion which is of the nature of manifesting in duality and is in the form of the dependent  status of the Strands,  Sattva etc.  This is the idea indicated by  'alone'  in  'Me alone'.  On the other hand those who would find just the manifestation of duality as they  [appear to]  exist - they do not across over the trick-of-Illusion.  Thus it is rightly said  'I am not in them (in the beings of the Sattva etc.)  etc.'
7.14 Hi, since; esa, this, aforesaid; daivi, divine; Maya mama, of Mine, of God, of Visnu, which (Maya) is My own; and which is guna-mayi, constituted by the gunas; is duratyaya, difficult to cross over; therefore, this being so, ye, those who; wholeheartedly prapadyante, take refuge; mam eva, in Me alone, in Me who am the Master of Maya and who am their own Self, by giving up all forms of rites and duties; te, they; taranti, cross over; etam, this; mayam, Maya, which deludes all beings. That is to say, they become freed from the bondage of the world.
'If it is that those who resort to You cross over this Maya, why then do not all take refuge in You alone?' This is being answered:
7.15 The evil-doers and the deluded who are the lowest of men do not seek Me; they whose knowledge is destroyed by illusion follow the ways of demons.
7.15 The sinner, the ignorant, the vile, deprived of spiritual perception by the glamour of Illusion, and he who pursues a godless life - none of them shall find Me.
7.15. The deluded evil-doers, the vilest men, who are robbed of knowledge by the trick-of-Illusion and have taken refuge in the demoniac nature-they do not resort to Me.
7.15 The evil-doers, the foolish, the lowest of men, those persons deprived of knowledge by delusion (Maya) and those who are dominated by demoniac nature - they do not seek refuge in Me.
7.15 The foolish evildoers, who are the most depraved among men, who are deprived of (their) wisdom by Maya, and who resort to demoniacal ways, do not take refuge in Me.
7.15 'Evil-doers', those who commit evil deeds, do not resort to Me. They are of four types, according to the degree of their evil deeds:  (i) the foolish, (ii) the lowest of men, (iii) those persons deprived of knowledge by Maya, and (iv) those given to demoniac nature. 'The foolish' are those who have misconceived knowledge. True knowledge consists in understanding that the self is dependent on the Lord and exists for Him. But 'the foolish' think they are independent and also that all enjoyable things of the world are their own and for their enjoyment. 'The lowest of men' are those who are incapable of turning towards Me, even though My essential nature is known to them generally. 'Persons who are deprived of knowledge by Maya' are those who, though possessing knowledge about Me and My manifestations, are moved by deceitful reasonings to contend that such knowledge is inconsistent and impossible. 'Those of demoniac nature' are those who have positive knowledge about Myself and My manifestation but hate Me. The intensity of sinfulness in these types in the order in which they are successively placed.
7.15 Na mam etc.  Those who do not take refuge with attention in Me,  even while their body remains fit for the purpose, they are evil-doers and the basest of men, deluded, demoniac,  i.e. given to darkness  (ignorance).  Hence, this is only the power of the trick-of-illusion.
7.15 Mudhah, the foolish; duskrtinah, evildoers, sinners; who are nara-adhamah, the most depraved among men; who are also apa-hrta-jnanah, deprived of, despoiled of (their) wisdom; mayaya, by Maya; and asritah, who resort to; asuram bhavam, demoniacal, ways, such as cruelty, untruthfulness, etc.; na, do not; prapadyante, take refuge; man, in Me, the supreme God.
7.16 Four kinds of virtuous men worship Me, O Arjuna, and they are the distressed, the seekr of knowledge, the seekr of wealth and the wise, O lord of the Bharatas.
7.16 O Arjuna! The righteous who worship Me are grouped by stages: first, they who suffer, next they who desire knowledge, then they who thirst after truth, and lastly they who attain wisdom.
7.16. Men of good action who worship Me always  are of four types:  the afflicted, the seeker of  knowledge, the seeker of wealth and the man of wisdom, O best among the Bharatas !
7.16 Four types of men of good deeds worship Me, O Arjuna, These are the distressed, the seekers after knowledge, the wealth-seekers, and the men of knowledge.
7.16 O Arjuna, foremost of the Bharata dynasty, four classes of people of virtuous deeds adore Me: the afflicted, the seeker of Knowledge, the seeker of wealth and the man of Knowledge.
7.16 'Men of good deeds,' i.e., those who have meritorious Karmas to their credit, and who resort to Me and worship Me alone - they too are divided into four types according to the degrees of their good deeds, each subseent type being better than the preceding, because of the greatness of their good deeds and gradation in respect of their knowledge.

(i)  The 'distressed' is one who has lost his position in life and his wealth, and who wishes to regain them (ii) He who 'aspires for wealth' is one who desires for wealth which he has not till then attained. Between them the difference is very little, as both of them seek wealth. (iii) He 'who seeks after knowledge' is one who wishes to realise the real nature of the self (in Its pure state) as an entity different from the Prakrti. He is called 'one who seeks to secure knowledge,' because knowledge alone is the essential nature of the self. (iv) And the 'man of knowledge' is he who knows that, it is the essential nature of the self to find happiness only as the Sesa (subsidiary or liege) of the Lord, as taught in the text beginning with, 'But know that which is other than this (lower nature) to be the higher Prakrti' (7.5). Without stopping with the knowledge of the self as different from the Prakrti, he desires to attain the Lord. He thinks that the Lord alone is the highest aim to reach.
7.16 See Comment under 7.19
7.16 Again, O Arjuna, foremost of the Bharata dynasty, caturvidhah, four classes; of janah, people; who are eminent among human beings and are pious in actions, and are sukrtinah, of virtuous deeds; bhajante, adore; mam, Me; artah, the afflicted-one who is overcome by sorrow, who is in distress, ['One who, being in distress and seeking to be saved from it, takes refuge (in Me).'] being over-whelmed by thieves, tigers, disease, etc.; jijnasuh, the seeker of Knowledge, who wants to know the reality of the Lord; artharthi, the seeker of wealth; and jnani, the man of Knowledge, [i.e. one who, already having intellectual knowledge, aspires for Liberation.] who knows the reality of Visnu.
7.17 Of them the wise, ever steadfast and devoted to the One, excels (is the best); for I am exceedingly dear to the wise and he is dear to Me.
7.17 Of all of these, he who has gained wisdom, who meditates on Me without ceasing, devoting himself only to Me, he is the best; for by the wise man I am exceedingly beloved and the wise man, too, is beloved by Me.
7.17. Of them, the man of wisdom, being always attached [to Me] with single-pointed devotion excels [others].  For, I am dear to the man of wisdom above all personal gains and he is dear to Me.
7.17 Of these, the man of knowledge, being ever with Me in Yoga and devoted to the One only, is the foremost; for I am very dear to the man of knowledge and he too is dear to Me.
7.17 Of them, the man of Knowledge, endowed with constant steadfastness and one-pointed devotion, excels. For I am very much dear to the man of Knowledge, and he too is dear to Me.
7.17 Of these four, 'the man of knowledge' is the foremost. Why?  Because of being ever with Me in Yoga and devoted to the One only. To the man of knowledge the attainment of Myself being the only end in view, he is ever with Me. As for the others, they contemplate on Me only until the fulfilment of their desires. But to the man of knowledge, there is single-minded devotion to Me only. Unlike him, the others, want only the objects of their desire and they are devoted to Me only as a means for gaining them. Hence he, the man of knowledge, alone is the foremost. Further I am very dear to the man of knowledge. Here the term 'artha' in relation to the expression 'athyartham' denotes 'what cannot be expressed adeately.' That is, even I, the omniscient and omnipotent, is unable to express how much I am dear to the Jnanin, since there is no such limit as 'this much' for this love. Such is the meaning. As in the case of Prahlada, the foremost among men of knowledge, it is said:  'But he with his thoughts firmly fixed on Krsna while being bitten by the great serpents, felt no pain from the wounds, being immersed in rapturous recollections of Him' (V. P., 1.17.39). I reciprocate this love infinitely.
7.17 See Comment under 7.19
7.17 Tesam, of them, among the four; jnani, the man of Knowledge, the knower of Reality, is nitya-yuktah, endowed with constant steadfastness as a result of being a knower of Reality; and he also becomes eka-bhaktih, endowed with one-pointed devotion, because he finds no one else whom he can adore. Conseently, that person of one-pointed devotion visisyate, excels, becomes superior, i.e. he surpasses (the others).
Hi, since; I, the Self, am priyah, dear; jnaninah, to the man of Knowledge; therefore aham, I; am atyartham, very much; priyah, dear to him. It is indeed a well known fact in the world that the Self is dear. The meaning, therefore, is that Vasudeva, being the Self of the man of Knowledge, is dear to him. And sah, he, the man of Knowledge, being the very Self of Me who am Vasudeva; is very much priyah, dear; mama, to Me.
'If that be so, then the other three-the afflicted and the others-are not dear to Vasudeva?' 'This is not so!' 'What then?'
7.18 Noble indeed are all these; but I deem the wise man as My very Self; for, steadfast in mind he is established in Me alone as the supreme goal.
7.18 Noble-minded are they all, but the wise man I hold as my own Self; for he, remaining always at peace with Me, makes me his final goal.
7.18. All these are noble persons, indeed.  But the man of wisdom is considered as the very Soul of  [Mine].  For, with his self (mind)  that has mastered the Yoga, he has resorted to nothing but Me as his most supreme goal.
7.18 All these are indeed generous (udarah), but I deem the man of knowledge to be My very self; for he, integrated, is devoted to Me alone as the highest end.
7.18 All of these, indeed, are noble, but the man of Knowledge is the very Self. (This is) My opinion. For, with a steadfast mind, he is set on the path leading to Me alone who am the super-excellent Goal.
7.18 Because they worship Me alone, all these are generous i.e., benefactors. For, those who receive from Me anything, however small they are, I consider them as contributing everything to Me (and thus as benefactors). But I deem the man of knowledge to be My very self. I consider Myself as depending on him for My support. Why is it so?  Because this person considers Me to be the highest and finds it impossible to support himself without Me; I also find it impossible to be without him. Thus, verily, he is My self.

The attainment of this state of mind reires innumerable auspicious births. It is attained after gaining the knowledge of the real nature of the self and the self feels that Its happiness consists in being a dependant (Sesa) of Myself.
7.18 See Comment under 7.19
7.18 Sarve, ete, all of these three, without exception; are eva, indeed, udarah, noble, i.e.; they are verily dear to Me. For, no devotee of Mine can become disagreeable to Me who am Vasudeva. But the man of Knowledge becomes very much dear. This is the difference.
Why is this so? In answer the Lord says: Tu but; jnani, the man of Knowledge; is atma eva, the very Self, not different from Me. This is me, My; matam, opinion, conviction. Hi, for; yuktatma, with a steadfast mind-having his mind absorbed in the idea, 'I am verily Vasudeva, the Lord, and none else', that man of Knowledge asthitah, is set on the path leading to, he is engaged in ascending to, going to; mam eva, Me alone, to the supreme Brahman; who am the anuttamam gatim, super-excellent Goal to be reached.
The man of Knowledge is being eulogized again:
7.19 At the end of many births the wise man comes to Me, realising that all this is Vaasudeva (the innermost Self); such a great soul (Mahatma) is very hard to find.
7.19 After many lives, at last the wise man realises Me as I am. A man so enlightened that he sees God everywhere is very difficult to find.
7.19. At the end of many births, one attains Me with the conviction that 'All is Vasudeva' - that noble Soul is very difficult to get.
7.19 At the end of many births, the man of knowledge finds refuge in Me, realising that 'Vasudeva is all.' It is very hard to find such a great-souled person.
7.19 At the end of many births the man of Knowledge attains Me, (realizing) that Vasudeva is all. Such a high-souled one is very rare.
7.19 Further after passing through innumerable auspicious births, one gets the knowledge:  'I find my sole joy as a Sesa of Vasudeva. I find my essence, existence and activities to be dependent on Him. He is superior over all others on account of His innumerable auspicious attributes.' Conseent to this knowledge he resorts to Me, i.e., meditates on Me, realising, 'Vasudeva alone is my highest end and also the means for attaining it, and whatever other desire remains in the mind, He alone is all that too for me'. Such a great-souled person, i.e., great-minded man is hard to find. It is very hard to find such persons in this world. This is the only meaning of the statement that 'Vasudeva is all,' because of the topic having been begun with the statements:  'For I am very dear to the man of knowledge' (7.17) and 'For he, integrated, is devoted to Me alone as the highest end' (7.18). It is so, also because that Jnanin whose traits are given here, possesses the same alities as the man of knowledge described earlier.

For, it has been said that the two Prakrtis, the animate and the inanimate, have their sole essence in being the Sesa (dependants) of the Supreme Person in the verses beginning with 'Earth, water' (7.4) and ending with, 'Ego-sense, thus My Prakrti is divided eightfold. This is my lower (Prakrti). But know that which is other than this (lower nature) and forms the life-principle to be the higher Prakrti' (7.4-5). Then take the beginning from 'I am the origin and dissolution of the whole universe. There is nothing higher than Myself, O Arjuna' (7.6-7), and ending with, 'Know that all the states of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are from Me alone. But I am not in them. They are in Me' (7.12). It has been declared in these texts that the two Prakrtis, both in their states of cause and effect, depend upon Him for their essence, existence and activities and that the Supreme Person is superior to everything in all respects. Therefore the knower of this truth alone is here spoken of as a man of knowledge or as one knowing 'All this is Vasudeva.' [The purpose of this explanation is to eliminate any pure monistic slant to this passage.]

Sri Krsna now explains the rarity of finding such a person of knowledge.
7.16-19 Caturvidhah  etc.,  upto  sudurlabhah.  Those  who  worship Me are men of good action.  They are of four types.  All these are noble ones.  For, other persons,  mean-minded as they are,  beg a cure of  their  affliction, and money etc., from persons who have hands, feet, stomach, body and intelligence  (or bodily strength)  that are eal to their  (the beggers)  own, or even from those who are very much inferior.  But, by comparison with the man of wisdom,  [the other three under estion]  are of inferior intelligence.  For, they entertain, at that sage too, a sense of duality.  Becuase, a sense of duality  'I  seek this from the Bhagavat'  is clearly  discernible in them.  On the other hand,  the man of  wisdom hangs on Me alone with a sense of identity  [of him with Me].  Hence, I am verily  indentical with him.  It is I alone, and not [any other] gain,  that is dear to him.  That is why he is having a mind purified by the firm conviction  'All is nothing but Vasudeva'.
7.19 Ante, at the end, after the completion; bahunam, of many; janmanam, births, which becme the repository for accumulating [Ast. omits this word.-Tr.] the tendencies leading to Knowledge; jnanavan, the man of Knowledge, who has got hiis Knowledge matured; directly prapadyate, attains; mam, Me, Vasudeva, who am the inmost Self; (realizing)-in what way?-iti, that; Vasudeva is sarvam, all. Sah, such a one, who realizes Me [Here Ast. adds the word Narayana.-Tr.] thus as the Self of all; is mahatma, a high-souled one. There is none else who can eal or excel him.
Therefore he is su-durlabhah, very rare among thousands of men, as it has been said (in verse 3).
The reason why one does not realize that all this is verily Vasudeva, the Self, is being stated:
7.2 I shall declare to thee in full this knowledge combined with realisation, after knowing which nothing more here remains to be known.
7.2 I will reveal to this knowledge unto thee, and how it may be realised; which, once accomplished, there remains nothing else worth having in this life.
7.2. I  Shall teach you this knowledge in full together with action; for a person who has known this there remains in this world nothing else to be known.
7.2 I will declare to you in full, this knowledge (of God) along with the knowledge which makes it distinguished (Vijnana), knowing which nothing else remains to be known.
7.2 I shall tell you in detail of this Knowledge which is combined with realization, [From the statement, 'jnasyasi, you will know', in the earlier verse, one may conclude that the Lord is speaking of indirect or theoretical knowledge. The word 'idam, this' rules out such a conclusion; and it has also been said that this Knowledge is 'savijnanam, combined with direct experienece, realization'; it is Consciousness.] after experience which there remains nothing else here to be known again.
7.2 I will declare to you in full this knowledge having Me for its object, along with Vijnana or distinguishing knowledge. Vijnana is that knowledge of God in which His nature is distinguished form all things. I am distinguished from all things, animate and inanimate, as the only Being opposed to all that is evil and endowed with infinitely great manifestation of countless multiples of attributes of all kinds which are auspicious, unsurpassed and without limit. I will declare to you that knowledge which has My essence as its object. Why say much?  I shall declare to you that knowledge knowing which nothing else remains to be known again in relation to Myself.

Sri Krsna declares that this knowledge, which will now be taught, is difficult to attain:
7.1-2 Mayi etc.  Jnanam etc.  The words  jnana  and  vijnana mean  [respectively]  'knowledge'  and  'action'.  There remains nothing  apart from these  [two]. For, all the knowables are rooted in the knowledge and action.
7.2 Aham, I; vaksyami, shall tell; te, you; asesatah, in detail, fully; of that (Knowledge) about Myself, which is idam, this; jnanam, Knowlege; which is savijnanam, combined with realization, associated with personal enlightenment; yat jnatva, after experiencing which Knowledge; avasisyate, there remains; na anyat, nothing else, anything that can be a means to human ends; jnatavyam, to be known; bhuyah, again; iha, here. (In this way) the Lord praises that Knowledge which is intended to be spoken, in order ot draw the attention of the hearer.
Thus, 'he who knows Me in reality becomes omniscient.' This is the idea. Therefore Knowledge is difficult to attain because of its superexcellent result.
How so? This is being answered:
7.20 Those whose wisdom has been rent away by this or that desire, go to other gods, following this or that rite, led by their own nature.
7.20 They in whom wisdom is obscured by one desire or the other, worship the lesser Powers, practising many rites which vary according to their temperaments.
7.20. Being robbed of their wisdom by innumerable desires [and] being controlled by their own nature, persons take refuge in other deities by following one or the other religious regulations.
7.20 Controlled by their inherent nature, and deprived of knowledge by various desires, worldly-minded men resort to other gods, observing various disciplines.
7.20 People, deprived of their wisdom by desires for various objects and guided by their own nature, resort to other deities following the relevant methods.
7.20 All men of this world are 'controlled', i.e., constantly accompanied by their own nature consisting in the Vasanas (subtle impressions) resulting from relation with the objects formed of the Gunas. Their knowledge about My essential nature is robbed by various Karmas, i.e., by objects of desire corresponding to their Vasanas (subtle impressions) born of their Karmas and constituted of Gunas. In order to fulfil these various kinds of desires they take refuge in, i.e., seek and worship, other divinities who are regarded as different from Me, such as Indra and others, observing various disciplines, i.e., practising rituals which are specially meant to propitiate only these divinities.
7.20 See Comment under 7.23
7.20 People, hrta-jnanah, deprived of their wisdom, deprived of their discriminating knowledge; taih taih kamaih, by desires for various objects, such as progeny, cattle, heaven, etc.; and niyatah, guided, compelled; svaya prakrtya, by their own nature, by particular tendencies gathered in the past lives; prapadyante, resort; anya-devatah, to other deities, who are different from Vasudeva, the Self; asthaya, following taking the help of; tam tam niyamam,the relevant methods-those processes that are well known for the adoration of the concerned deities.
7.21 Whatsoever form any devotee desires to worship with faith  that (same) faith of his I make firm and unflinching.
7.21 But whatever the form of worship, if the devotee have faith, then upon his faith in that worship do I set My own seal.
7.21. Whatever may be the form  [of the deity] a devotee-whosoever he may be-desires to worship with faith, I assume that form which is firm and is according to [his] faith.
7.21 Whichever devotee seeks to worship with faith whatever form, I make that very faith steadfast.
7.21 Whichever form (of a deity) any devotee wants to worship with faith, that very firm faith of his I strengthen.
7.21 These divinities too constitute My body as taught in the Sruti text like:  'He who, dwelling in the sun, whom the sun does not know, whose body is the sun' (Br. U., 3.7.9). Whichever devotee seeks to worship with faith whatever form of Mine, such as the Indra, although not knowing these divinities to be My forms, I consider his faith as being directed to My bodies or manifestations, and make his faith steadfast, i.e., make it free from obstacles.
7.21 See Comment under 7.23
7.21 Yam yam, whichever; tanum, form of a deity; yah, any covetous person- among these people with desires; who, being endowed sraddhaya, with faith; and being a bhaktah, devotee; icchati, wants; arcitum, to worship; tam eva, that very; acalam, firm, steady; sraddham, faith; tasya, of his, of that particular covetous person-that very faith with which he desires to worship whatever form of a deity, in which (worship) he was earlier engaged under the impulsion of his own nature-; [Ast. takes the portion 'svabhavatah yo yam devata-tanum sraddhaya arcitum icchati' with the next verse.-Tr.] vidadhami, I strengthen.
7.22 Endowed with that faith, he engages in the worship of that (form) and from it he obtains his desire, these being verily ordained by Me (alone).
7.22 If he worships one form alone with real faith, then shall his desires be fulfilled through that only; for thus have I ordained.
7.22. Endowed with that faith, he seeks to worship that deity and therefrom receives his desired objects that are ordained by none but Me.
7.22 Endowed with that faith, he worships that form and thence gets the objects of his desire, granted in reality by Me alone.
7.22 Being imbued with that faith, that person engages in worshipping that form, and he gets those very desired results therefrom as they are dispensed by Me alone.
7.22 He, endowed with that faith without obstacles, performs the worship of Indra and other divinities. Thence, i.e., from the worship of Indra and other divinities, who constitute My body, he attains the objects of his desire, which are in reality granted by Me alone. Although he does not know at the time of worship that divinities like Indra, who are his objects of worship, are My body only, and that worship of them is My worship, still, inasmuch as this worship is, in reality, My worship, he attains his objects of desire granted by Me alone.
7.22 See Comment under 7.23
7.22 Yuktah,being endued; taya, with that; sraddhaya, faith, as granted by Me; sah, that person; ihate, engages in; radhanam, i.e. aradhanam, worshipping; tasyah, that form of the deity. And labhate, he gets; tan hi, those very; kaman, desired results; tatah, there-from, from that form of the deity which was worshipped; as vihitan, they are dispensed, meted out; maya eva, by Me alone, who am the omniscient, supreme God, because I am possessed of the knowledge of the apportionment of the results of actions.
The meaning his that he surely gets those desired results since they are ordained by God.
If the reading be hitan (instead of hi tan), then the beneficence (-hita means beneficent-) of the desired result should be interpreted in a figurative sense, for desires cannot be beneficial to anyone!
7.23 Verily the reward (fruit) that accrues to those men of small intelligence is finite. The worshippers of the gods go to them, but My devotees come to Me.
7.23 The fruit that comes to men of limited insight is, after all, finite. They who worship the Lower Powers attain them; but those who worship Me come unto Me alone.
7.23. But, that fruit of  those men of poor intellect is finite.  Those, who perform sacrifices, aiming at the gods, go to gods, and My devotees go to Me.
7.23 But limited is the fruit gained by these men of small understanding. The worshippers of the gods will go to the gods but My devotees will come to Me.
7.23 That result of theirs who are of poor intellect is indeed limited. The worshippers of gods go to the gods. My devotees go to Me alone.
7.23 The men of 'small understanding' means those whose understanding is poor, who worship only Indra and other divinities. The fruit of their worship is small and finite. Why?  The worshippers of divinities like Indra go to the divinities. And Indra and other divinities possess limited joy and live only for a limited time. So if they attain eality of enjoyment with them, they also fall down along with them in due course; but My devotees, knowing that their acts are of the nature of My worship, renouncing attachment for finite, fruits, reach Me, having for their purpose the pleasing of Me alone. That is, they never more return to Samsara. For Sri Krsna teaches later on:  'But on reaching Me there is no rirth, O Arjuna' (8.16).

Now Sri Krsna declares:  'But these others (i.e., who worship Indra etc.) regard as insignificant even My incarnations among men and other beings in order to make Myself easy for all to resort to.'
7.20-23 Kamaih etc.  upto man api.  On the other hand, those persons, whose minds are conditioned  by a variety of their own respective desires for the best and so on (or the desires that may be classified as the best and so on) - they have thier thinking faculty  carried away by their desires,  and worship a particular deity who possesses nothing but My intermediate body that suits only to those devotees'  desires.   Hence, they obtain their desired result from Me alone.  But, that result has an end of its own, because it is limited by the mental impressions of their own.  Therefore those who perform sacrifice etc.,  with the aim of becming Indra  etc.,  (or of attaining the houses of Indra etc.)  gain their desired fruit accordingly.  On the other hand, those whose chief aim is to attain Me,  they gain Me alone.										
 But, while the Absolute-being is immanent  in all, how is it that  the fruit  achieved by the worshippers of other deities is limited ?  The answer is given as :
7.23 Since those non-discriminating men with desires are engaged in disciplines for limited results, therefore, tat phalam, that result; tesam, of theirs; alpamedhasam, who are of poor intellect, of poor wisdom; antavat tu bhavati, is limited, ephemeral, indeed. Deva-yajah, the worshippers of gods; yanti, go; devan, to the gods. Madbhaktah, My devotees; yanti, to; mam api, to Me alone.
'Thus, though the effort needed is the same, they do not resort to me alone for the unlimited result. Alas! they are surely in a pitiable condition.' In this manner the Lord expresses his compassion.
'Why do they not take refuge in Me alone?'
The answer is:
7.24 The foolish think of Me, the Unmanifest, as having manifestation, knowing not My higher, immutable and most excellent nature.
7.24 The ignorant think of Me, who am the Unmanifested Spirit, as if I were really in human form. They do not understand that My Superior Nature is changeless and most excellent.
7.24. The men of poor intellect, are not conscious of the higher, changeless and supreme nature of Mine; and hence, they regard Me, the Unmanifest, to be a manifest one.
7.24 Not knowing My higher nature, immutable and unsurpassed, the ignorant think of Me as an unmanifest entity who has now become manifest.
7.24 The unintelligent, unaware of My supreme state which is immutable and unsurpassable, think of Me as the unmanifest that has become manifest.
7.24 Ignorant people do not know My higher nature, immutable and unsurpassed. They do not know that it is I, who is worshipped through all rites, who is the Lord of all, and whose nature is beyond speech and mind, that has incarnated as the son of Vasudeva, without abandoning My divine nature, out of My supreme compassion and parental love for those who resort to Me and in order that I may be the refuge of all. They consider Me as only a worldly prince who was not manifest before and who has now become manifest by Karma and has secured a special form. Therefore, they do not resort to Me, nor do they worship Me.

Why is He not manifest (to them)?  Sri Krsna says:
7.24 Avyaktam etc.  Becuase of their poor intellect, these  [worshippers of  other deities]  do not at all recognise  the unmanifest and ultimately true  nature of Mine.  On the contrary, they conceive Me merely as one, possessing only a manifest form with a particular  knowledge  and a particular  innage nature,  all suitable to their own desires.  [They think] not otherwise.  That is why, no  name or form  [of a deity]  is insisted upon  [by the Lord].
 
However,  this is the established view  [of the teachers of the school]  in this regard :  If a person holds fast to a specific form of a deity in order to get rid of desires, that  [itself] results in his  becoming pure and emancipated.  If the case is reversed,  [the result]  would be a contrary one.
7.24 Abuddhayah, the unintelligent, the non-discriminating ones; ajanantah, unaware; mama, of My; param, supreme; bhavam, state, My reality as the supreme Self; which is avyayam, immutable, undecaying; and anuttanam, unsurpassable; manyante, think; mam, of Me; as avyaktam, the unmanifest, the invisible; apannam, that has become; vyaktim, manifest, visible, at present [At present, after being embodied as an Incarnation.]-though I am the ever well-known God. They think so because they are unaware of My reality. This is the idea.
What is the reason for their ignorance? This is being stated:
7.25 I am not manifest to all (as I am) veiled by the Yoga-Maya. This deluded world does not know Me, the unborn and imperishable.
7.25 I am not visible to all, for I am enveloped by the illusion of Phenomenon. This deluded world does not know Me as the Unborn and the Imperishable.
7.25. Being surrounded by the trick-of-yoga-Illusion, I am not clear to all;  [and  hence]  this deluded world [of perceivers] does not recognise Me, the unborn and the undying.
7.25 Veiled by My Maya, I am not manifest to all. This deluded world does not recognize Me as the unborn and immutable.
7.25 Being enveloped by yoga-maya, I do not become manifest to all. This deluded world does not know Me who am birthless and undecaying.
7.25 Concealed by the Maya called Yogamaya, I am associated with a human form and other generic structures which are special to individual selves. Because of this I am not manifest to all. The foolish, by seeing in Me merely the human or the other generic structures, do not know that My powers are greater than those of Vayu and Indra, that My lustre is more brilliant than that of sun and fire, that though visible to all, I am unborn, immutable, the cause of all the worlds, the Lord of all, and that I have assumed a human form, so that all who want can take refuge in Me.
7.25 See Comment under 7.26
7.25 Yoga-maya-samavrtah, being enveloped by yoga-maya-Yoga means the combination, the coming together, of the (three) gunas; that (combination) is itself maya, yoga-maya; being enveloped, i.e. veiled, by that yoga-maya; aham, I; na prakasah, do not become manifest; sarvasya, to all, to the world. The idea is that I become manifest only to some devotees of Mine. For this very reason, ayam, this; mudhah, deluded; lokah, world; na abhijanati, does not know; mam, Me; who am ajam, birthless; and avyayam, undecaying. [In verse 13 the reason for the non-realization of the supreme, unalified Brahman was stated. The present verse states the reason for the non-realization of the alified Brahman.]
'That yoga-maya, because of My being covered by which the world does not know Me- that yoga-maya, since it belongs to Me, does not obstruct the knowlege of Me who am God, the possessor of maya, just as the magic of any other magician does not cover his knowledge.' Since this is so, therefore-
7.26 I know, O Arjuna, the beings of the past, the present and the future, but no one knows Me.
7.26 I know, O Arjuna, all beings in the past, the present and the future; but they do not know Me.
7.26. O Arjuna, I know the beings that are gone off, that are present and are yet to be born; but no one, knows Me.
7.26 I know all beings, O Arjuna, past, present and those to come; but no one knows Me.
7.26 O Arjuna, I know the past and the present as also the future beings; but no one knows Me!
7.26 I know all being that have passed away, those that live now and those that will hereafter. But no one knows Me. Among the beings existing in the three-fold divisions of time whom I look after, no one understands Me as of the nature described and as Vasudeva incarnated to be a refuge for all. So no one resorts to Me. Therefore, the one who knows Me really (Jnanin) is extremely difficult to be found. Such is the meaning.

So also:
7.25-26 Naham etc.  Vadaham  etc.  I am not  perceivable to all.		
 But the actions themselves, if performed,  would  beget emancipation  at the time of dissolution  [of the world].  otherwise, how does the total dissolution  come to be there ?  When this  doubt arises,  [the Bhagavat]  commences  [to answer]  as :
7.26 O Arjuna, aham, I, however; veda, know; samatitani, the past beings; and vartamanani, the present. I know ca, also; bhavisyani, the future; bhutani, beings. Tu, but; na kascana, no one; veda, knows; mam, Me. Except the one person who is My devotee and has taken refuge in Me, no one adores Me, jus because he does not know My reality.
'What, again,is the obstruction to knowing Your reality, being prevented by which the creatures that are born do not know You?' In anticipation of such a estion, the Lord says this:
7.27 By the delusion of the pairs of opposites arising from desire and aversion, O Bharata, all beings are subject to delusion at birth, O Parantapa.
7.27 O brave Arjuna! Man lives in a fairy world, deceived by the glamour of opposite sensations, infatuated by desire and aversion.
7.27. O descendant of Bharata, O scorcher of foes !  At the time of creation, all  beings get delusion because of the illusion of pairs [of opposites]  arising from desire and hatred.
7.27 By the delusion of the pairs of opposites springing from desire and hate, O Arjuna, all beings are deluded as soon as they are born.
7.27 O scion of the Bharata dynasty, O destroyer of foes, due to the delusion of duality arising from likes and dislikes, all creatures become bewildered at the time of their birth.
7.27 As soon as beings are born they are deluded. This delusion springs from sense experiences described as pairs of opposites like heat and cold. Such reactions spring from desire and hate.

The purport is this:  Desire and hatred for the pairs of opposites like pleasure and pain, which are constituted of Gunas, have their origin in the Jivas from the past experiences they had in their previous births. The subtle impressions or Vasanas of these previous experiences manifest again as instinctive desire and hatred towards similar objects in every succeeding birth of the Jivas. The delusive force of these impressions make them deluded from the very beginning. It becomes their nature to have love or hatred for such objects, in place of having happiness and misery at union with or separation from Me. The Jnanin, however, feels happiness when he is in union with Me and misery when separated from Me. No other being is born with such a nature as found in the Jnanin.
7.27 Iccha-etc.  [At the time of destruction]  he  (the personal Soul)  is led to expand  exceedingly,  while he still remains  unconcious  on account of his desire, aversion,  agner,  dellusion etc.  On account  of  this,  the entire world  takes recourse to the sleeping stage while it continues to  exist in its entirity within the  stomach of the Prakrti  (the Prime Casue); and to exist just being (temporarily)  not  capable of performing its activities.  For, as long as  there is delusion,  the mental impressions are to be experienced, as in the case of the sleeping stage in the night time every day.  But on that account no emancipation is gained.  For, when the experience of  loss  of  unconsciousness is over  (i.e., when consciousness is regained),  again the mundane life with its varieties of activites  is found.
7.27 Iccha-dvesa-samutthena, by what arises from likes and dislikes: iccha, likes, and dvesa, dislikes, are iccha-dvesau; anything arising from them is icchadvesa-samutthah. (Creatures are duluded) by that. By what? When that is thus sought to be known in particular, the Lord answers: dvandva-mohena, by the delusion of duality. Delusion (moha) that originates from duality (advandva) is dvandva-moha. Those very likes and dislikes, which are mutually opposed like heat and cold, which relate to happiness and sorrow and their causes, and which come into association with all beings in due course, are termed as duality (and this deludes all creatures).
As regards them, when likes and dislikes arise from the experience of happiness, sorrow and their causes, then, by bringing the wisdom of all beings under their control, they create bewilderment which is the cause of the impediment to the rise of knowledg about the reality of Self, the suprem Truth. Indeed, exact knowledg about objects even in the external world does not arise in one whose mind is overpowered by the defects, viz likes and dislikes. It goes without saying that knowledge of the indwelling Self, beset with many obstacles as it is, does not arise in a completely bewildered person whose intelligence has been overcome by them.
Therefore, bharata, O scion of the Bharata dynasty; owing to that delusion of duality arising from likes and dislikes, sarvabhutani, all creatures become deluded. Parantapa, O destroyer of foes; they yanti sammoham, become bewildered, come under delusion; sarge, at the time of their birth, i.e. at the time of their origination. The idea is that all creatures that come into being do so prepossessed by delusion. 'Since this is so, therefore all creatures, being deluded and having their wisdom obstructed by that delusion of duality, do not know Me who am their Self. Hence, they do not adore Me as their Self.'
'Who, again, are those that, becoming free from the delusion of duality, come to know You, and adore You as the Self in accordance with the scriptures?'
In order to elaborate the subject enired about, it is being said:
7.28 But those men of virtuous deeds whose sins have come to an end, and who are freed from the delusion of the pairs of opposites, worship Me, steadfast in their vows.
7.28 But those who act righteously, in whom sin has been destroyed, who are free from the infatuation of the conflicting emotions, they worship Me with firm resolution.
7.28. But those men of virtuous deeds, whose sin has come to an end-they, being free from the delusion of pairs [of opposites], worship Me with firm resolve.
7.28 But the doers of good deeds, whose sins have come to an end, are freed from the delusion of the pairs of opposites. They worship Me, steadfast in their vows.
7.28 On the other hand, those persons who are of virtuous deeds, whose sin has come to an end, they, being free from the delusion of dulaity and firm in their convictions, adore Me.
7.28 However, there are some whose sins, accruing from beginningless time, which cause desire or hatred to the pairs of opposites and annual the tendency towards Me, have come to an end, i.e., have become weakened, through the accumulation of good actions in numerous births, They resort to Me, devoid of delusion produced by the Gunas, and worship Me alone in proportion to the excellence of their Karmas previously described. In order to attain deliverance form old age and death and for aciring the supreme consummation of reaching Me, they remain steadfast in their vows.

Sri Krsna enumerates what special things are to be known and what ought to be attained by these three classes of votaries of God:
7.28 See Comment under 7.30
7.28 Yesam jananam, those persons; tu, on the other hand; punya-karmanam, who are of virtuous deeds, in whom exist virtuous deeds that are the cause of purification of the mind; whose papam, sin; antagatam, has come to an end, is almost eradicated, attenuated; te, they; dvandva-moha-nirmuktah, being free from the delusion of duality as described; and drdhavratah, firm in their convictions-those who [Here Ast. adds, 'sarva-parityaga-vratena, through the vow of relinishing everything'.-Tr.] have the firm knowledge that the supreme Reality is such alone and not otherwise are called drdhavratah-; bhajante, adore; mam, Me, the supreme Self.
Why do they worship? This is being answered:
7.29 Those who strive for liberation from old age and death, taking refuge in Me, realise in full ï1thatï1 Brahman, the whole knowledge of the Self and all action.
7.29 Those who make Me their refuge, who strive for liberation from decay and Death, they realise the Supreme Spirit, which is their own real Self, and in which all action finds its consummation.
7.29. Those, who, relying on  Me, strive to achieve freedom from old age and death-they realise all to be the Brahman and realise all the actions governing the Self.
7.29 Those who take refuge in Me and strive for deliverance from old age and death, know brahman (or the self) all about the nature of that self, and the entire Karma (or activities leading to rirth).
7.29 Those who strive by resorting to Me for becoming free from old age and death, they know that Brahman, everything about the individual Self, and all about actions. [They know Brahman as being all the individual entities and all actions. This verse prescribes meditation on the alified Brahman for aspirants of the middle class. Verses beginning with the 14the speak about the reaization of the unalified Brahman by aspirants of the highest class.]
7.29 Those who take refuge in Me and strive for deliverance from old age and death, i.e., for the vision of the real nature of the self as distinct from the Prakrti, they know brahman (the pure individual self). They also know all about the individual self, and the whole of Karma. [This attainment is known as Kaivalya, which means the aloofness of the self in absorption in Its own bliss.]
7.29 See Comment under 7.30
7.29 Ye, those who; yatanti, strive; asritya, by resorting; mam, to Me, the supreme God, by having their minds absorbed in Me; jara-marana-moksaya, for becoming free from old age and death; te, they; viduh, know; tat, that; brahma, Brahman, which is the Supreme; they know krtsnam, everything; about adhyatmam, the individual Self, that indwelling intity; ca, and; they know akhiliam, all; about karma, actions.
7.3 Among thousands of men, one perchance strives for perfection; even among those successful strivers, only one perchance knows Me in essence.
7.3 Among thousands of men scarcely one strives for perfection, and even amongst those who gain occult powers, perchance but one knows me in truth.
7.3. Among thousands of men, perchance, one makes effort for the determined knowledge.  Among those, having the determined knowledge-even though they make effort-perchance one realises Me correctly.
7.3 Among thousands of men, some one strives for perfection; even among those who strive for perfection, some one only knows Me; and among those who know Me, some one only knows Me in reality.
7.3 Among thousands of men a rare one endeavours for perfection. Even of the perfected ones who are diligent, one perchance knows Me in truth.
7.3 'Men', i.e., those who are alified for observing the ?nds of the Sastras - among thousands of such men, only some one strives till the attainment of perfection. Among thousands who strive till the attainment of perfection, some one only, understanding Me, strives to attain success through Me (i.e., through My grace). Among thousands of those who might know Me, some one only knows Me in reality, as I am. In other words, there is no one who is capable of knowing Me as I am, i.e., as distinguished from all other entities, as implied in the expression Vijnana. Sri Krsna will declare later on:  'It is very hard to find such a great-souled person' (7.19), and 'But no one knows Me' (7.26).
7.3 Manusyanam  etc.  All  [persons]  are not fit for this subject.  By this statement,  [the  Bhagavat] has declared that,  as the subject is difficult to grasp, it is to be learnt with effort.
7.3 Sahasresu manusyanam, among thousands, among a multitude of men; kascit, a rare one; yatati, endeavours; siddhaye, for perfection. [For perfection: for the rise of Knowledge through the purification of the mind.] Siddhanam api, even of the perfected one; yatatam, who are diligent-they (those diligent ones themselves) being (considered to be) verily perfect because they are striving for Liberation; of them-; kascit, one perchance, indeed; vetti, knows; mam, Me; tattvatah, in truth.
Having drawn the attention of the hearer by arousing interest, the Lord says:
7.30 Those who know Me with the Adhibhuta (pertaining to the elements), Adhidaiva (pertaining to the gods) and the Adhiyajna (pertaining to the sacrifice) know Me even at the time of death, steadfast in mind.
7.30 Those who see Me in the life of the world, in the universal sacrifice, and as pure Divinity, keeping their minds steady, they live in Me, even in the crucial hour of death."
7.30. Those who realise Me as one [identical] with what governs the beings, deities and with what governs the sacrifices-they, even at the moment of their journey, experience Me, with their mastering the Yoga.
7.30 And those who know Me with the Adhibhuta, Adhidaiva and the Adhiyajna, they too, with their minds fixed in meditation, know Me even at the hour of death.
7.30 Those who know me as existing in the physical and the divine planes, and also in the context of the sacrifice, they of concentrated minds know Me even at the time of death.
7.30 Here, other alified persons distinct from those already mentioned (i.e., those who desire Kaivalya) are to be understood, because of the mention again of the term 'those' (ye). Even though the declaration - those seekers of fortune who know Me as being connected with the higher material entities' (Adhibhuta) and 'with that which is higher to divinities' (Adhidaiva) i.e., the self in Its lordship - resmles a repetition, it is really an injunction on account of the meaning not being known otherwise. The statement of knowing Me as being connected with the sacrifice is also enjoined as an injunction for all the three types of differently alified aspirants (those who aspire for Kaivalya, wealth and liberation) without any difference, because of the nature of the subject matter, that being sacrificial. None of the three types of aspirants can give up the performance of the great sacrifices and other rituals in the form of periodical and occasional rituals. They know Me at the hour of death in a way corresponding with their objectivies.

Because of the term ca (too) in 'they too,' those who have been mentioned before as 'striving for release from old age and death' are also to be understood along with the others as knowing Me at the hour of death. By this, even the Jnanin knows Me as being connected with the sacrifice on account of the nature of the meaning of the subject treated (i.e., sacrifice). They also know Me even at the hour of death in a way corresponding with their objective. The purport is that, besides the others mentioned earlier like the knower of the Self, those others who are now described as knowing Him with Adhibhuta, Adhidaiva and Adhiyajna are to be included among those who will know Him at the time of death.
7.30  Yesam  etc. upto  yukta-cetasah.   Those, in whom the darkness  (ignorance) has totally vanished, and the Self is well secured due to the decaying of the good and bad effects of actions-they break off the canopy of their [castle of the] mighty delusion and realise everything as the Brahman studded (purified) with the rays of the Bhagavat, emerging out of the darkness of old age and death;  and realise 'what governs the Self, the beings, the deities and the sacrifices are all My own different aspects'.  They also experience Me at the time of their journey, on account of their having internal organ permanently immersed in the thought of the Bhagavat.  For, those who remember the Bhagavat even earlier,  since their birth-they at the last momnet would very well remember the Absolute Lord.  [Hence] it is good to simply keep silent with regard to those who opine 'What is the use of worshiping since  [the time of]  birth ?'
7.30 Ye, those who; viduh, know; mam, Me; sa-adhi-bhuta-adhidaivam, as existing in the physical and the divine planes; ca, and also; sa-adhiyajnam, as existing in the context of the sacrifice; te, they; yukta-cetasah, of concentrated minds-those who have their minds absorbed in God; viduh, know; mam, Me; api ca, even; prayanakale, at the time of death. [For those who are devoted to God, there is not only the knowledge of Brahman as identified with all individuals and all actions (see previous verse), but also the knowledge of It as existing in all things on the physical, the divine and the sacrificial planes. Those who realize Brhaman as existing in the context of all the five, viz of the individual, of actions, of the physical,of the divine, and of the sacrifices-for them with such a realization there is no forgetting, loss of awareness, of Brahman even at the critical moment of death.]
7.4 Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect and egoism  thus is My Nature divided eightfold.
7.4 Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect and personality; this is the eightfold division of My Manifested Nature.
7.4. My nature is divided eightfold, such as the Earth, the Water, the Fire, the Wind, the Ether, the Mind, and also the Intellect and the Ego;
7.4 Earth, water, fire, air, ether, Manas, Buddhi and ego-sense - thus My Prakrti is divided eightfold.
7.4 This Prakrti of Mine is divided eight-fold thus: earth, water, fire, air, space, mind, intellect and also egoism.
7.4 Know that Prakrti, the material cause of this universe, which consists of endless varieties of objects and means of enjoyment and places of enjoyment, is divided into eightfold substances - earth, water, fire, air and ether, having smell, taste etc., as their attributes, and Manas along with kindred sense organs and the categories Mahat and ego-sense - all belonging to Me.
7.4 See Comment under 7.5
7.4 Iyam, this; prakrtih, Prakrti, [Prakrti here does not mean the Pradhana of the Sankhyas.] the divine power called Maya; me, of Mine, as described; bhinna, is divided; astadha, eight-forl; iti, thus: bhumih, earth-not the gross earth but the subtle element called earth, this being understood from the statement, 'Prakrti (of Mine) is divided eight-fold'. Similarly, the subtle elements alone are referred to even by the words water etc.
Apah, water; analah, fire; vayuh, air; kham, space; manah, mind. By 'mind' is meant its source, egoism. By buddhih, intellect, is meant the principle called mahat [Mahat means Hiranyagarbha, or Cosmic Intelligence.] which is the source of egoism. By ahankarah, egoism, is meant the Unmanifest, associated [Associated, i.e. of the nature of.] with (Cosmic) ignorance. As food mixed with position is called poison, similarly the Unmainfest, which is the primordial Cause, is called egoism since it is imbued with the impressions resulting from egoism; and egoism is the impelling force (of all). It is indeed seen in the world that egoism is the impelling cause behind all endeavour.
7.5 This is the inferior Prakriti, O mighty-armed (Arjuna); know thou as different from it My higher Prakriti (Nature), the very life-element, by which this world is upheld.
7.5 This is My inferior Nature; but distinct from this, O Valiant One, know thou that my Superior Nature is the very Life which sustains the universe.
7.5. This is the lower [nature of Mine].  Not different from this is My superior nature which has become the individual Soul and by which this world is maintained. O mighty armed (Arjuna), you must know this.
7.5 This is My lower Prakrti. But, O mighty-armed One, know that My higher nature is another. It is the life-principle (Jiva-bhuta), by which this universe is sustained.
7.5 O mighty-armed one, this is the inferior (Prakrti). Know the other Prakrti of Mine which, however, is higher than this, which has taken the from of individual souls, and by which this world is uphelp.
7.5 This is My lower Prakrti. But know My higher Prakrti which is different from this, i.e., whose nature is different from this inanimate Prakrti constituting the objects of enjoyment to animate beings. It is 'higher', i.e., is more pre-eminent compared to the lower Prakrti which is constituted only of inanimate substances. This higher Nature of Mine is the individual self. Know this as My higher Prakrti through which the whole inanimate universe is sustained.
7.4-5 Bhumih  etc.  Apard  etc.  [The demonstrative]  'this' denotes  what is being perceived  [as objects] through  sense-organs by all men at the stage of mundane life.  This is only one and at the same time is divided eigth-fold.   Therefore the universe is one and unitary, because it is made of one single material cause.  By  this statement, monism is demonstrated even while following  the Prakrti theory.  The selfsame  Prakrti has become the living one i.e., the personal Soul.  Hence it is superior  [to what has  become eight-fold].  It also belongs to Me alone and  not to anybody else.  This  Prakrti is  [thus]  two-fold and varied in the form of the universe consisting of the  knowables and the knower.  That is  why this  Prakrti  (the basic  material  nature),  being the substratum of all beings reflected on the surface of the clean mirror, viz., the Self , is nothing but Self's own nature and [hence]  never leaves Him.  This world :  the Earth etc.  [mentioned in the  4th verse].
7.5 O mighty-armed one, iyam, this; is apara, the inferior (Prakrti)-not the higher, (but)-the impure, the source of evil and having the nature of worldly bondage. Viddhi, know; anyam, the other, pure; prakrtim, Prakrti; me, of Mine, which is essentially Myself; which, tu, however;is param, higher, more exalted; itah, than this (Prakrti) already spoken of; Jiva-bhutam, which has taken the form of the individual souls, which is characterized as 'the Knower of the body (field)', and which is the cause of sustenance of life; and yaya, by which Prakriti; idam, this; jagat, world; dharyate, is upheld, by permeating it.
7.6 Know that these two (Natures) are the womb of all beings. So I am the source and dissolution of the whole universe.
7.6 It is the womb of all being; for I am He by Whom the worlds were created and shall be dissolved.
7.6. All beings are born of this womb.  Hence keep [them] nearby.  I am the origin as well as the dissolution of the entire world.
7.6 Know that all beings have these two for the source of their birth. Therefore, I am the origin and the dissolution of the whole universe.
7.6 Understand thus that all things (sentient and insentient) have these as their source. I am the origin as also the end of the whole Universe.
7.6 Know that all beings from Brahma down to a tuft of grass, who have their origin in these two Prakrtis of Mine, are aggregated forms of the self and of inanimate matter. Irrespective of whether they are existing in a superior or inferior form, the selves and inanimate matter are mixed together in them. On account of their origination in My two Prakrtis, they are Mine. So, know that because the entire universe has its origination in these two Prakrtis which have their origination in Me, I am myself the origin and dissolution of the entire universe. For the same reason, I am its Lord (Sesin).

It is proved on the basis of the Srutis and Smrtis that these two, Prakrti and Purusa (matter and the self), which form the aggregate of all animate and inanimate beings, have the Supreme Person as their cause. This is evident from Sruti and Smrti texts like the following:  'The Mahat resolves into Avyakta, Avyakta into Aksara, Aksara into Tamas, and Tamas becomes one with the Supreme Lord' (Su. U., 2); 'O sage, distinct from the form of Visnu, the Supreme Lord, the two forms, Prakrti and Purusa, arise' (V. P., 1.2.24); and 'What was described by Me as Prakrti in its dual form of the manifest and the unmanifest, and the Purusa do merge in the Supreme Self, and the Supreme Self is the support of all. He is the Supreme Lord named Visnu, exalted in the Vedas and Vedanta' (V. P., 6.4.38-39).
7.6 See Comment under 7.7
7.6 Upadharaya, understand; iti, thus; that sarvani, all; bhutani, things; etat-yonini, have these (etat) as their source (yoni)-things that have these lower and higher Prakrtis, charcterized as the 'field' and the 'Knower of the field (body)', as their source are etat-yonini. Since My two Prakrtis are the source, the cause of all things, therefore, aham, I; am the prabhavah, origin; tatha, as also; the pralayah, end, the termination; krtsnasya, of the whole; jagatah, Universe.
The maning is this: I, who am the ominscient God, am the source of the Univese through My two Prakrtis.
Since this is so, therefore-
7.7 There is nothing whatsoever higher than Me, O Arjuna. All this is strung on Me, as clusters of gems on a string.
7.7 O Arjuna! There is nothing higher than Me; all is strung upon Me as rows of pearls upon a thread.
7.7. There exists nothing beyond Me, O Dhananjaya; all this is strung on Me just as the groups of pearls on a string.
7.7 There is nothing higher than Myself, O Arjuna. All this is strung on Me, as rows of gems on a thread.
7.7 O Dhananjaya, there is nothing else whatsoever higher than Myself. All this is strung on Me like pearls on a string.
7.7 I am absolutely superior to all in two ways: 1) I am the cause of both the Prakrtis and I am also their controlling master (Sesin). This controllership over inanimate nature is exercised through the animate Prakrti (the Jivas) who form the inner controller (Sesin) of their bodies which are constituted of inanimate nature. 2) I am supreme to all in another sense also - as the possessor of knowledge, power, strength etc., in an infinite degree. There is no entity other than Me with such attributes of an eal or superior nature.

The aggregate of all the animate and inanimate things, whether in their causal state or in the state of effect, is strung on Me who abides as their Self, as a row of gems on a thread. They depend on Me. And it is proved that the universe of inanimate and animate beings exists as the body with Brahman (i.e. the Supreme Person) as their Self as declared by the Antaryami-brahmana and other texts:  'He whose body is the earth' (Br. U., 3.7-3), 'He whose body is the self' (Br. U. Madh., 3.7.22), and 'He is the inner self of all beings, without evil, He is the Lord in the supreme heaven, He is the one Narayana' (Su. U., 7).

Thus, as everything constitutes the body of the Supreme Person forming only a mode of His who is their Self, the Supreme Person alone exists, and all things (which we speak of as diversity) are only His modes. Therefore all terms used in common parlance for different things, denote Him only. Sri Krsna shows this by coordinating some important ones among these entities with Himself.
7.6-7 Etadyonini etc.  Mattah etc.  Keep them nearby :  You should place them in your neihbourhood  following the method of experience augmented by practice.  Or [it may mean  that]  You should bear in mind that I, the Vasudeva, am both the origin  and destruction of all beings.  What is indicated by  'I'  is this :  Even though  [it is viewed that]  the Absolute  (Isvara) is distinct  from the Prakrti,  Soul  and Supreme  Soul,   It remains by all means immanent in all;  hence there is no room for the theory of dualism of the Sankhya and the Yoga schools.  Just as the pearls on the string.  Just as the string does exist unobserved in the interior  [in a necklace]  though its form remains  undetected, in the same fashion  I remain in all.
7.7 O Dhananjaya, asti, there is; na anyat kincit, nothing else whatsoever, no other cause; parataram, higher; mattah, than Me, the supreme God; i.e. I Myself am the source of the world. Since this is so, therefore, sarvam, all; idam, this, all things, the Universe; protam,is strung, woven, connected, i.e. transfixed; mayi, on Me, the supreme God; like cloth in the warp, [Like cloth formed by threads constituting its warp and woof.] and iva, like; maniganah, peals; sutre,on a string.
'What alities are You endowed with, by virtue of which all this is strung on You? This is being answered:
7.8 I am the sapidity in water, O Arjuna; I am the light in the moon and the sun; I am the syllable Om in all the Vedas, sound in ether and virility in men.
7.8 O Arjuna! I am the Fluidity in water, the Light in the sun and in the moon. I am the mystic syllable Om in the Vedic scriptures, the Sound in ether, the Virility in man.
7.8. O son of Kunti !  I am the taste in waters; the light in the moon and the sun; the best hymn (OM) in the entire Vedas; the sound that exists in the ether (or the mystic hymnal sound in the entire Vedas-a sound that is in the ether); and the manly vigour in men.
7.8 I am the taste in the waters, O Arjuna! I am the light in the sun and the moon; the sacred syllable Om in all the Vedas; sound in the ether; and manhood in men am I.
7.8 O son of Kunti, I am the taste of water, I am the effulgence of the moon and the sun; (the letter) Om in all the Vedas, the sound in space, and manhood in men.
7.8 - 7.11 All these entities with their peculiar characteristic are born from Me alone. They depend on Me; inasmuch as they constitute My body, they exist in Me alone. Thus I alone exist while all of them are only My modes.
7.8 Raso  'ham apsu etc.  I am that  [basic] taste which has not yet devolped as to have the classification of sweetness and so on,  and which is being  tasted in all waters.  Similarly, the light :  That  [light]  which is  devoid of gentleness and fierceness etc.  (The sound that exist]  in the ether in the sky.  The sound that etc.  Here the emphasis is on all sounds,  as they are attributes of  the ether.  Or, the passage denotes that empty basic  sound which, being exclusively an attribute of th ether;  which does not depend on any other  external  cuases like union  and partition   [of some  objects];  which exists in the ether within the cave of the Brahman;  which is ite intelligible  to the groups of Yogins  with attentive heart  (mind);  which bears the name Anahata; and which pervades the entire groups of the Vedas - that sound represents the Absolute.  Manly vigour ;  that lusture by means of which one is identified  as a man throughout the earth.
7.8 Kaunteya, O son of Kunti, aham, I; am rasah, the taste, which is the essence of water. The idea is that water is depedent on Me who am its essence. This is how it is to be understood in every case. Just as I am the essence of water, similarly, asmi, I am; the prabha, effulgence; sasi-suryayoh, of the moon and the sun; pranavah, (the letter) Om; sarva-vedesu, in all the Vedas. All the Vedas are established on Me who am that Om. So also (I am) sabdah, the sound; khe, in space, as the essence. Space is established on Me who am that (sound). In the same way, nrsu, in men; (I am) paurusam, manhood- the ality of being man, from which arises the idea of manhood. Men are established on Me who am such.
7.9 I am the sweet fragrance in the earth and the brilliance in the fire, the life in all beings, and I am the austerity in ascetics.
7.9 I am the Fragrance of earth, the Brilliance of fire. I am the Life Force in all beings, and I am the Austerity of the ascetics.
7.9. I  am  the pure smell in the earth; I am also the brilliance in the sun; I am the life in al beings and austerity in the ascetics.
7.9 I am the pure smell in the earth; I am the brilliance in the fire; I am the life-principle in all beings, and austerity in ascetics.
7.9 I am also the sweet fragrance in the earth; I am the brillinace in the fire, and the life in all beings; and I am the austerity of the ascetics.
7.8 - 7.11 All these entities with their peculiar characteristic are born from Me alone. They depend on Me; inasmuch as they constitute My body, they exist in Me alone. Thus I alone exist while all of them are only My modes.
7.9 Punyah etc.  By its own  nature  pure is that smell which exists in the earth as its exclusive property.  The foulness, the excessiveness [of th smell]  are due to  contamination of  other elements.  That has been stated  [elsewhere] as :
 
'[A  particular  thing]  becomes hard because of the excess of the properties  of the earth;  foul-smelling on account of the rise of the  fire-properties;  and stiff due to liberality  (excess)  of the properties of water'  and  so on.
7.9 I am also the punyah, sweet; gandhah, fragrance; prthivyam, in the earth. The earth is dependent on Me who am its fragrance. The natural sweetness of smell in the earth is cited by way of suggesting sweetness of taste of water etc. as well. But foulness of smell etc. is due to contact with particular things, resulting from nescience, unholiness, etc. of worldly people.
Ca, and ; asmi, I am; the tejah, brilliance; vibhavasau, in fire; so also (I am) the jivanam, life-that by which all creatures live; sarva-bhutesu, in all beings. And I am the tapah, austerity; tapasvisu, of ascetics. Ascetics are established in Me who am that austerity.
8.10 At the time of death, with unshaken mind, endowed with devotio, by the power of Yoga, fixing the whole life-breath in the middle of the two eyrows, he reaches that resplendent Supreme Person.
8.10 He who leaves the body with mind unmoved and filled with devotion, by the power of his meditation gathering between his eyebrows his whole vital energy, attains the Supreme.
8.10. That person endowed with a steady mind, with devotion and also with the Yoga-power, reaches at the time of journey that Supreme Divine Soul, by fixing properly the life-breath in between his eye brows.
8.10 At the time of death, having fully fixed the Prana (vita force) between the enrows with an unswering mind, and being imbued with devotion as also the strength of concentration, he reaches that resplendent supreme person.

8.10 At the time of death, with unshaken mind, endowed with devotio, by the power of Yoga, fixing the whole life-breath in the middle of the two eyrows, he reaches that resplendent Supreme Person.

8.10 Prayana-kale, at the time of death; after first brining the mind under control in the lotus of the heart, and then lifting up the vital force-through the nerve going upward-by gradually gaining control over (the rudiments of nature such as) earth etc. [Space, air, fire, water and earth.] and after that, samyak, avesya, having fully fixed; pranam, the Prana (vital force); madhye, between; the bhruvoh, eye-brows, without losing attention; acalena manasa, with an unwavering mind; he, the yogi possessed of such wisdom, yuktah, imbued; bhaktya, with devotion, deep love; ca eva, as also; yoga-balena, [Yoga means spiritual absorption, the fixing of the mind on Reality alone, to the exclusion of any other object.] with the strength of concentration-i.e; imbued with that (strength) also, consisting in steadfastness of the mind arising from accumulation of impressions resulting from spiritual absorption; upaiti, reaches; tam, that; div yam, resplendent; param, supreme; purusam, Person, described as 'the Omniscient, the Ancient,' etc.
The Lord again speaks of Brahman which is sought to be attained by the process going to be stated, and which is described through such characteristics as, 'What is declared by the knowers of the Vedas,'etc.:
8.10 At the time of death, having fully fixed the Prana (vita force) between the enrows with an unswering mind, and being imbued with devotion as also the strength of concentration, he reaches that resplendent supreme person.
8.9 - 8.10 He who focusses his life-breath between the eyrows at the time of death with a mind rendered unswerving through its purification achieved by the strength of Yoga conjoined with Bhakti practised day after day; and he who contemplates on the 'Kavi' i.e., the Omniscient, the 'Primeval', i.e., who existed always, 'the Ruler,' i.e., who governs the universe, 'who is subtler than the subtle,' i.e., who is subtler than the individual self, 'who is the Dhata' of all, i.e., the creator of all, 'whose nature is inconceivable,' i.e., whose nature is other than everything else, 'who is sun-coloured and beyond darkness,' i.e., who possesses a divine form peculiar to Himself - he who concentrates on Him, the Divine Person described above, between the eyrows, attains Him alone. He attains His state and comes to have power and glory similar to His. Such is the meaning.

Then He describes the mode of meditation to be adopted by the seeker of Kaivalya or the Jijnasu (i.e., of one who seeks to know his own self or Atman in contrast to one whose object is God-realisation).
8.9-10 Kavim etc. Prayana-etc.  He who would meditate in this manner  (i.e. as described in the verse) etc.  The Sun-coloured. The Sun-colour does not delmit the Absolute (Vasudeva-tattva).  However, a comparison with the sun is drawn because the absolute too transcends the darkness of ignorance consisting of the varied wrong notions, like fancying forms etc.  This is the idea here.  In between the eye-brows :  [This may be understood] as above.
8.10 Prayana-kale, at the time of death; after first brining the mind under control in the lotus of the heart, and then lifting up the vital force-through the nerve going upward-by gradually gaining control over (the rudiments of nature such as) earth etc. [Space, air, fire, water and earth.] and after that, samyak, avesya, having fully fixed; pranam, the Prana (vital force); madhye, between; the bhruvoh, eye-brows, without losing attention; acalena manasa, with an unwavering mind; he, the yogi possessed of such wisdom, yuktah, imbued; bhaktya, with devotion, deep love; ca eva, as also; yoga-balena, [Yoga means spiritual absorption, the fixing of the mind on Reality alone, to the exclusion of any other object.] with the strength of concentration-i.e; imbued with that (strength) also, consisting in steadfastness of the mind arising from accumulation of impressions resulting from spiritual absorption; upaiti, reaches; tam, that; div yam, resplendent; param, supreme; purusam, Person, described as 'the Omniscient, the Ancient,' etc.
The Lord again speaks of Brahman which is sought to be attained by the process going to be stated, and which is described through such characteristics as, 'What is declared by the knowers of the Vedas,'etc.:
8.11 That which is declared Imperishable by those who know the Vedas, that which the self-controlled (ascetics or Sannyasins) and passion-free enter, that desiring which celibacy is practised  that goal I will declare to thee in brief.
8.11 Now I will speak briefly of the imperishable goal, proclaimed by those versed in the scriptures, which the mystic attains when free from passion, and for which he is content to undergo the vow of continence.
8.11. That Unchanging One which the Veda-knowers speak of;  Which the passion-free ascetics enter into; seeking Which they practise celibacy (or spiritual life);  that Goal together with means   [to reach It]  I shall tell you.
8.11 I shall speak to you briefly of that immutable Goal which the knowers of the Vedas declare, into which enter the deligent ones free from attachment, and aspiring for which people practise celibacy.

8.11 That which is declared Imperishable by those who know the Vedas, that which the self-controlled (ascetics or Sannyasins) and passion-free enter, that desiring which celibacy is practised  that goal I will declare to thee in brief.

8.11 Pravaksye, I shall speak; te, to you; samgrahena, briefly; tat, of that; which is called the aksaram, immutable-that whch does not get exhausted, which is indestructible; padam, Goal to be reached; yat, which; veda-vidah, the knowers of the Vedas, the knowers of the purport of the Vedas; vedanti, declare, speak of It as opposed to all alifications-'It is neither gross nor minute' (Br. 3.8.8) etc.-, in accordance with the Upanisadic text, 'O Gargi, the knowers of Brahman say this Immutable (Brahman) is that' (ibid); and further, yat, into which, after the attainment of complete realization; visanti, enter; yatayah, the diligent ones, the monks; who have become vita-ragah, free from attachment; and icchantah, aspiring to know (-to know being supplied to complete the sense-); yat, which Immutable; people caranti, practise; brahmacaryam, celibacy-at the teacher's house.
Commencing with, '"O venerable sir, which world does he really win thery who, among men, intently meditates on Om in that wonerful way till death?" To him he said, "O Satyakama, this very Brahman that is (known as) the inferior and superior is but this Om"' (pr.5.1-2), it has been stated, 'Again, anyone who meditates on the supreme Purusa with the help of this very syllable Om, as possessed of three letters,৷৷.he is lifted up to the world of Brahma (Hiranyagarbha) by the Sama-mantras,' (op.cit.5) etc. Again, beginning with '(Tell me of that thing which you see as) different from virtue, different from vice,' it has been stated, 'I tell you briefly of that goal which all the Vedas with one voice propound, which all the austerities speak of, and wishing for which people practise Brahmacarya: it is this, viz Om' (Ka.1.2.14-15), etc. 
In the above otations, Om which is going to be spoken of is presented as a name of this supreme Brahman, and also as Its symbol like an image. This has been done as a means to meditation on it (Om) for the attainment of the supreme Brahman by poeple of low and mediocre intellect, in as much as this leads to Liberation in course of time. Here also that very meditation on Om in the manner stated above-which is the means of attaining the supreme Brahman introduced in, '(He who meditates on) the Omniscient, the Ancient,' and in, '(I shall speak to you birefly of that immutable Goal) which the knowers of the Vedas declare,' and which (meditation) leads to Liberation in due course [Realization of Brahman leads to immediate Liberation (sadyomukti, whereas meditation (contemplation, upasana) leads to gradual Liberation (krama-mukti).-Tr.]-has to be spoken of along with 'adherence to yoga' as also whatever is connected directly or indirectly with it. For this purpose the following text is begun:
8.11 I shall speak to you briefly of that immutable Goal which the knowers of the Vedas declare, into which enter the deligent ones free from attachment, and aspiring for which people practise celibacy.
8.11 I shall show you briefly that goal which the knowers of the Veda call 'the imperishable,' i.e., as endowed with attributes like non-grossness etc., - that imperishable which 'the ascetics freed from passion enter'; that imperishable 'desiring to attain which men practise continence'. What is attained by the mind as its goal is called 'pada'. I shall tell you briefly My essential nature which is beyond all description and which is explained in the whole of Vedanta and which is to be meditated upon. Such is the meaning.
8.11 Yad aksaram etc. A means is called sangraha because by using this, the end is grasped i.e., determined. That Goal,  together with means I shall tell you :  Let me tell you now the means for [your] constant practice.
8.11 Pravaksye, I shall speak; te, to you; samgrahena, briefly; tat, of that; which is called the aksaram, immutable-that whch does not get exhausted, which is indestructible; padam, Goal to be reached; yat, which; veda-vidah, the knowers of the Vedas, the knowers of the purport of the Vedas; vedanti, declare, speak of It as opposed to all alifications-'It is neither gross nor minute' (Br. 3.8.8) etc.-, in accordance with the Upanisadic text, 'O Gargi, the knowers of Brahman say this Immutable (Brahman) is that' (ibid); and further, yat, into which, after the attainment of complete realization; visanti, enter; yatayah, the diligent ones, the monks; who have become vita-ragah, free from attachment; and icchantah, aspiring to know (-to know being supplied to complete the sense-); yat, which Immutable; people caranti, practise; brahmacaryam, celibacy-at the teacher's house.

For this purpose the following text is begun:
8.12 Having closed all the gates, confined the mind in the heart and fixed the life-breath in the head, engaged in the practice of concentration.
8.12 Closing the gates of the body, drawing the forces of his mind into the heart and by the power of meditation concentrating his vital energy in the brain;
8.12. Properly controlling all the gates [in the body]; well restraining the mind in the heat; fixing one's own prana in the head; taking resort to the firmness of the Yoga;
8.12 Having controlled all the passages, having confined the mind in the heart, and having fixed his own vital force in the head, (and then) continuing in the firmness in yoga;

8.12 Having closed all the gates, confined the mind in the heart and fixed the life-breath in the head, engaged in the practice of concentration.

8.12 Samyamya, having controlled; sarva-dvarani, all the passages, the doors of perception; niruddhya, having confined; the manah, mind; hrdi, in the heart-not allowing it to spread out; and after that, with the help of the mind controlled therein, rising up through the nerve running upward from the heart, adhaya, having fixed; atmanah, his own; pranam, vital force; murdhni, in the lead; (and then) asthitah, continuing in; yogadharanam, the firmness in yoga-in order to make it steady-.
And while fixing it there itself,
8.12 Having controlled all the passages, having confined the mind in the heart, and having fixed his own vital force in the head, (and then) continuing in the firmness in yoga;
8.12 - 8.13 Subduing all the senses like ear etc., which constitute the 'doorways' for sense impressions, i.e., withdrawing them from their natural functions; holding the mind in Me, the imperishable 'seated within the lotus of the heart'; practising 'steady abstraction of mind (Dharana) which is called concentration or Yoga,' i.e., abiding in Me alone in a steady manner; uttering the sacred 'syllable Om,' the brahman which connotes Me; remembering Me, who am expressed by the syllable Om; and fixing his 'life-breath within the head' - whosoever abandons the body and departs in this way reaches the highest state. He reaches the pure self freed from Prakrti, which is akin to My form. From that state there is no return. Such is the meaning. Later on Sri Krsna will elucidate:  'They describe that as the highest goal of the Atman, which is not destroyed when all things are destroyed, which is unmanifest and imperishable' (8.2021).

Thus, the modes of contemplation on the Lord by the aspirants after prosperity and Kaivalya (Atmann-consciousness) have been taught according to the goal they lead to. Now, Sri Krsna teaches the way of meditation on the Lord by the Jnanin and the mode of attainment by him.

And while fixing it there itself,
8.13 Uttering the one-syllabled Om  the Brahman  and remembering Me, he who departs, leaving the body, attains to the Supreme Goal.
8.13 Repeating Om, the Symbol of Eternity, holding Me always in remembrance, he who thus leaves his body and goes forth reaches the Spirit Supreme.
8.13. Reciting the single-syllabled Om, the very Brahman; meditating on Me; whosoever travels well, casting away  [his]  body-surely he attains My  State.
8.13 He who departs by leaving the body while uttering the single syllable, viz Om, which is Brahman, and thinking of Me, he attains the supreme Goal.

8.13 Uttering the one-syllabled Om  the Brahman  and remembering Me, he who departs, leaving the body, attains to the Supreme Goal.

8.13 Yah, he who; prayati, departs, dies; tyajan, by leaving; deham, the body-the phrase 'leaving the body' is meant for alifying departure; thery it is implied that the soul's departure occurs by abandoning the body, and not through the destruction of its own reality, having abandoned thus-; vyaharan, while uttering; the eka-adsaram, single syllable; om iti brahma, viz Om, which is Brahman, Om which is the name of Brahman; and anusmaran, thinking; mam, of Me, of God who is implied by that (syllable); sah, he; yati, attains; the paramam, supreme, best; gatim, Goal.
Further,
8.13 He who departs by leaving the body while uttering the single syllable, viz Om, which is Brahman, and thinking of Me, he attains the supreme Goal.

Further,
8.14 I am easily attainable by that ever-steadfast Yogi who constantly and daily remembers Me (for a long time), not thinking of anything else (with a single mind or one-pointed mind), O Partha (Arjuna).
8.14 To him who thinks constantly of Me, and of nothing else, to such an ever-faithful devotee, O Arjuna, am I ever accessible.
8.14. And whosoever constantly bears Me in mind never attached to any other object-for this Yogin, ever devout, I am easy to attain, O son of Prtha !
8.14 O son of Prtha, to that yogi of constant concentration and single-minded attention, who remembers Me uninterruptedly and for long, I am easy of attainment.

8.14 I am easily attainable by that ever-steadfast Yogi who constantly and daily remembers Me (for a long time), not thinking of anything else (with a single mind or one-pointed mind), O Partha (Arjuna).

8.14 Partha, O son of Prtha, tasya yoginah, to that yogi; nitya-yuktasya, of constant concentration, who is ever absorbed (in God); and ananya-cetah, of single-minded attention, a yogi whose mind is not drawn to any other object; yah, who; smarati, remembers; mam, Me, the supreme God; satatam, uninteruptedly; and nityasah, for long-.
By satatam, uninterrupteldy, is meant 'without any break'. By niryasah, is meant along duration. Not six months, nor even a year! What then? The meaning is: He who remembers Me for his whole life, continuously.
To that yogi aham, I; am sulabhah, easy of attainment. Since this is so, therefore one should remain ever absorbed in Me, with mind given to nothing else.
'What follows from Your being easy of attainment?' This is being answered: 'Hear what follows from My being easy of attainment.'
8.14 O son of Prtha, to that yogi of constant concentration and single-minded attention, who remembers Me uninterruptedly and for long, I am easy of attainment.
8.14 I am easy to access to that Yogin who is 'ever integrated with Me,' i.e., who wants constant contact with Me, who recollects Me; and whose mind is not in 'anything else without break' (Nityasah), i.e., at the time of meditation and also during all other times (Satatam). As I am exceedingly dear to him, he is unable to sustain himself without remembering Me and cherishing My memory which is incomparably dear to him. I am the only object he wants to attain and not any mode of My being like sovereignty, etc. I Myself grant him the capacity to attain full maturity in devotional practice necessary for attaining Me - namely, the annulment of all obstacles and the establishment of the state of mind that renders Me exceedingly dear to oneself. The Sruti also says:  'He whom this (Self) chooses, by him He can be obtained' (Mun. U., 3.2.3 and Ka. U., 2.22). And Sri Krsna Himself will teach:  "To those, ceaselessly united, who worship Me, I bestow that discernment by which they come to Me. Out of mercy for them, I, abiding in their heart, dispel the darkness born of ignorance, by the brilliant lamp of knowledge" (10.10;11).

In the remaining part of this chapter, He teaches that the Jnanis and the aspirants after Kaivalya do not deturn, and that the seekers after power and prosperity return.
8.12-14 Sarvadvarani etc., upto Yoginah.  The gates :  the  sense organs, like the eyes and not the place of excrement etc.  Restraining the mind in the heart : By this, only the absence of attachment towards the objects, and not any seat, is stated.  One's own Prana :  the driver of one's own Self (the vital air).  So, the meaning is 'Fixing this  Prana in the head i.e., the very Self with the Power-of-Will, lying beyond all categories.  Thus the controlling of body  [has been prescribed].  Reciting Om :  This denotes the act of controlling the sense of speech.  Meditating on Me :  It signifies the non-wandering of the mind over other objects.  Whosoever travels well :  Whosoever travels day after day not to return back  (i.e., for final emancipation).  Therefore casting away the body i.e., longing 'How to avoid taking once again the body, a repository of all troubles',  whosoever remembers Me always  with his mind, that thinks nothingelse-he reaches  Me i.e., he realises My state.  Really the Sage (Vyasa) does not favour  [the idea of]  upward flight [of the Soul from the body]  that may go against the pronounced intention of  [attaining] total identity with the Absolute Brahman that admits no duality.  Therefore it has been said :
 
'If the Siva-existence  (the Absolute State) is Omnipresent, then the upward  flight  serves no purpose indeed.  On the othe hand, if Siva (the Absolute) is not Omnipresent then the upward flight cannot yield Siva (the Auspicious one, the Absolute)'.
 
Alternately  [the Gita passage may be interpreted as :]  If some persons have not undergone the process of constant practice, yet at the time of death there arises [in them] - due to some undefinable  reason, like the Free Will of the Lord and  the like-a condition, similar to the one mentioned above, then  [in the case of those persons]  this condition itself - characterised as  'the flight from the body'  (getting oneself disassociated from the body) - is stated  [by the Sage] as a means obstructing all the other potential mental impressions.  That is why in the passage starting  'That unchanging one which the Veda-knowers speek of'  and ending  'I shall tell you that',  [the Sage] has made  a solemn declaration in order  to explain the astonishing nature of the reflection on the Bhagavat - even though it lasts only a moment - marked by the destruction of all the  [other] potential mental impressions.  Hence the great teachers also say :
 
'O Sambhu !  If  You could set Your foot, atleast for the  duration of a single winking of the eye, in  [my] blemishless mind, what else would  You not accomplish  [for me]'.
 
That is why, with a view to satisfy those who raise the estion 'But the breaking  [of body of the wise] has been found without remembrance  [of the Lord]  at the time of departure',  here it is said  'He who [remembers Me]  constantly with the mind, not attached to any other thing.'  The meaning of it is :  'He whose mind is not attached to any other result to be achieved.'  For him I am easy to attain :  For him there is no need to undertake the trouble of searching for a suitable time  for departure; making pilgrimage to sacred places; [waiting for] the time of the summer solastice;  taking shelter in the temples;  augmenting the  [Strand] Sattva; remaining absorbed in the thought  [of the Lord];  [expecting]  the auspicious moment of einox and of the day  [time]; selecting a locality that is naturally pure; having body free from dirt of attachment (or unguent);  wearing clean cloth; and similar other ones.  Hence it has been stated earlier  [under VIII,  5-7 above]  'Either in a sacred place or in the house of a dog-cooker' etc.		
 But it has been declared that 'He attains My  State.'  Will there he rirth for him even after  attaining that State ?  Considering this doubt  [the Lord] says :
8.14 Partha, O son of Prtha, tasya yoginah, to that yogi; nitya-yuktasya, of constant concentration, who is ever absorbed (in God); and ananya-cetah, of single-minded attention, a yogi whose mind is not drawn to any other object; yah, who; smarati, remembers; mam, Me, the supreme God; satatam, uninteruptedly; and nityasah, for long-.
By satatam, uninterrupteldy, is meant 'without any break'. By niryasah, is meant along duration. Not six months, nor even a year! What then? The meaning is: He who remembers Me for his whole life, continuously.
To that yogi aham, I; am sulabhah, easy of attainment. Since this is so, therefore one should remain ever absorbed in Me, with mind given to nothing else.
'What follows from Your being easy of attainment?' This is being answered: 'Hear what follows from My being easy of attainment.'
8.15 Having attained Me these great souls do not again take birth (here) which is the place of pain 
and is non-eternal: they have reached the highest perfection (liberation).
8.15 Coming thus unto Me, these great souls go no more to the misery and death of earthly life, for they have gained perfection.
8.15. Having attained Me, the men of great soul who have achieved the supreme perfection, do not get  the transient rirth, a store-house of all troubles.
8.15 As a result of reaching Me, the exalted ones who have attained the highest perfection do not get rirth which is an abode of sorrows and which is impermanent.

8.15 Having attained Me these great souls do not again take birth (here) which is the place of pain 
and is non-eternal: they have reached the highest perfection (liberation).

8.15 Upetya mam, as a result of reaching Me who am God-as a result of realizing My nature; mahatmanah, the exalted ones, the monks; gatah, who have attained; the paramam, highest; samsiddhim, perfection, called Liberation; na, do not; apnuvanti, get; this kind of punarjanama, rirth. As to what kind of rirth they do not get, the Lord states its characteristics-duhkhalayam, which is an abode of sorrows, a resort of physical and other sorrows, i.e. a birth to which sorrows adhere. It is not merely an abode of sorrows, but also asavatam, impermanent, having no fixity of nature.
On the other hand, those who do not reach Me, they come again.
Again, 'Is it that those who attain someone other than You return?' This is being answered:
8.15 As a result of reaching Me, the exalted ones who have attained the highest perfection do not get rirth which is an abode of sorrows and which is impermanent.
8.15 Having attained Me, they are not subject to rirth, which leads to a condition that is transient and an abode of sorrow. These great souls, i.e., men of noble minds, worship and attains Me as the sorrow object of attainment; because they possess knowledge of My essential nature as it really is; they are unable to maintain or sustain themselves without Me, as I am exceedingly dear to them. With their minds deeply attached to Me and completely dependent on Me, they reach Me as the supreme goal.

Sri Krsna next teaches the reason for the return to Samsara of those aspirants for Aisvarya (prosperity) and for the non-return to Samsara of those who have reached the Lord:
8.15 Mam upetya etc.  In the next verse it is going to be asserted that from all others (other goals)  one has to return back.  But  [in the present verse it is declared that ]  'having attained  Me, the Yogins do not again suffer from fear of rirth etc.'
8.15 Upetya mam, as a result of reaching Me who am God-as a result of realizing My nature; mahatmanah, the exalted ones, the monks; gatah, who have attained; the paramam, highest; samsiddhim, perfection, called Liberation; na, do not; apnuvanti, get; this kind of punarjanama, rirth. As to what kind of rirth they do not get, the Lord states its characteristics-duhkhalayam, which is an abode of sorrows, a resort of physical and other sorrows, i.e. a birth to which sorrows adhere. It is not merely an abode of sorrows, but also asavatam, impermanent, having no fixity of nature.
On the other hand, those who do not reach Me, they come again.
Again, 'Is it that those who attain someone other than You return?' This is being answered:
8.16 (All) the worlds including the world of Brahma are subject to return again, O Arjuna; but he who reaches Me, O son of Kunti, has no rirth.
8.16 The worlds, with the whole realm of creation, come and go; but, O Arjuna, whoso comes to Me, for him there is nor rebirth.
8.16. Till the Brahman [is attained],  people do return from [each and every] world, O Arjuna !  But there is no rirth for one who has attained Me, O son of Kunti !
8.16 O Arjuna, all the worlds together with the world of Brahma are subject to return. But, O son of Kunti, there is no rirth after reaching Me.

8.16 (All) the worlds including the world of Brahma are subject to return again, O Arjuna; but he who reaches Me, O son of Kunti, has no rirth.

8.16 O Arjuna, all the lokah, worlds; abrahma-bhuvanat, together with the world of Brahma-bhuvana is that (place) in which creatures are born, and brahma-bhuvana means the world of Brahma; punah avartinah, are subject to return, are by nature liable to come again; Tu, but; kaunteya, O son of Kunti, na vidyate, there is no; punarjanma, rirth; upetya, after reaching; mam, Me alone.
Why are all the worlds together with the realm of Brahma subject to return? Becuase they are limited by time. How?
8.16 O Arjuna, all the worlds together with the world of Brahma are subject to return. But, O son of Kunti, there is no rirth after reaching Me.
8.16 All the worlds, from the realm of Brahma included in the Brahmanda (cosmic sphere), are spheres in which experiences conferring Aisvarya (prosperity and power) can be obtained. But they are destructible and those who attain them are subject to return. Therefore destruction, i.e., return is unavoidable for the aspirants for Aisvarya, as the regions where it is attained perish. On the contrary there is no rirth to those who attain Me, the Omniscient, who has true resolves, whose sport is creation, sustentation and dissolution of the entire universe, who is supremely compassionate and who is always of the same form. For these reasons there is no destruction in the case of those who attain Me.

He now elucidates the time-period settled by the Supreme Person's will in regard to the evolution and dissolution of the worlds upto the cosmic sphere of Brahma and of those who are within them.
8.16 A Brhma etc.  [This verse]  has been interpreted by all as  'There is rirth even for those who have reached the world of Brhma  (the personal god).'  If this interpretation is accepted, then it would amount to the  proposition  that going to the  worlds that are higher than that  [of Brahma],  is emancipation  [from  rirth].  However according to us,  with  our inner sight blurred by the powerful darkness of doubt, this interpretation does not seem to touch the heart  [of the text].  Hence, the following  is the wick of the lamp brought from the Agama literature :  Till  Brahman :  Till the status of the Supreme  Brahman is attained.  Till then all are subject to return  (to rirth)  from each and every world, whether it lies adjacently, or above or below  [the world of Brahman];  men run round like a wheel  wandering without stop from one place to another.			
 But who knows in this manner viz.,  'from all the world there is return' ?  For, it is heard [in the Puranas]  that [the personal gods like]  Brahma etc., themselves exist indeed for a very  long period.  How is it  that they too are subject to return again ?  If they are subject to return, will they not be of the nature of having birth and death ?  Expecting this objection,  [the Lord] says :
8.16 O Arjuna, all the lokah, worlds; abrahma-bhuvanat, together with the world of Brahma-bhuvana is that (place) in which creatures are born, and brahma-bhuvana means the world of Brahma; punah avartinah, are subject to return, are by nature liable to come again; Tu, but; kaunteya, O son of Kunti, na vidyate, there is no; punarjanma, rirth; upetya, after reaching; mam, Me alone.
Why are all the worlds together with the realm of Brahma subject to return? Becuase they are limited by time. How?
8.17 Those people who know the day of Brahma which is of a duration of a thousand Yugas (ages) and the night which is also of a thousand Yugas duration, they know day and night.
8.17 Those who understand the cosmic day and cosmic night know that one day of creation is a thousand cycles, and that the night is of equal length.
8.17. Those who know the day of Brahma as compassing one thousand yugas (world-ages), and night [also] as compassing  one thousand yugas-those men know the day and night of Brahma.
8.17 Those poeple who are knowers of what day and night are, know the day of Brahma which ends in a thousand yugas [The four yugas (in the human worlds), viz Satya, Treta, Dwapara, and Kali are made up of 4,320,000 years. This period multiplied by a thousand constitutes one day of Brahma. His night also extends over an eal period. See M.S. and V.S.A.], and His night which ends in a thousand yugas.

8.17 Those people who know the day of Brahma which is of a duration of a thousand Yugas (ages) and the night which is also of a thousand Yugas duration, they know day and night.

8.17 Viduh, they know; that ahah, day; brahmanah, of Brahma, of Prajapati, of Virat; yat, which; sahasra-yuga-paryantam, ends in a thousand yugas; and also the ratirm, night; yuga-sahasra-antam, which ends in a thousand yugas, having the same duration as the day. Who knows (these)? In reply the Lord says: Te, they; janah, poeple; ahoratra-vidah, who are the knowers of what day and night are, i.e. the people who know the measurement of time. Since the worlds are thus delimited by time, therefore they are subject to return.
What happens during the day and the night of Prajapati is being stated:

8.17 These men who know the order of the day and night as established by My will in regard to all beings, beginning with man and ending with Brahma - they understand that what forms Brahma's day is a unit comprising in it a thousand periods of four Yugas (Catur-yugas) and anight is a unit of eal duration.

8.18 From the Unmanifested all the manifested (worlds) proceed at the coming of the 'day'; at the coming of the 'night' they dissolve verily into ï1thatï1 alone which is called the Unmanifested.
8.18 At the dawning of that day all objects in manifestation stream forth from the Unmanifest, and when evening falls they are dissolved into It again.
8.18. While the day approaches, all manifestations issue forth from the unmanifest and while the night approaches they dissolve into the same that bears the name 'the unmanifest.'
8.18 With the coming of day all manifested things emerge from the Unmanifest and when night comes they merge in that itself which is called the Unmanifested. 

8.18 From the Unmanifested all the manifested (worlds) proceed at the coming of the 'day'; at the coming of the 'night' they dissolve verily into ï1thatï1 alone which is called the Unmanifested.

8.18 Ahar-agame, with the coming of day, at the time when Brahma wakes; sarvah vyaktayah, all manifested things, all things that get manifested, all creatures characterized as moving and non-moving; prabhavanti, emerge, become manifested; avyaktat, from the Unmanifested-avyakta (Unmanifested) is the state of sleep of Prajapati; from that avyakta. Similarly, ratri-agame, when night comes, at the time when Brahma sleeps; praliyante, they, all the manifested things, merge; tatra eva, in that itself; avyakta-sanjnake, which is called the Unmanifested referred to above.
In order to obviate the defect of the emergence of some unmerited result and the destruction of merited results; [The following verse says that the very same multitude of beings continues in the different cycles of creation, and there-fore these two defects do not arise.] for pointing out the meaningfulness of the scriptures [For the earlier reason the scriptures do not lose their validity.] dealing with bondage and Liberation; and with a view to propounding detachment from the world on the ground that the helpless multitude of beings perishes after being born again and again under the influence of accumulated results of actions that have for their origin such evils as ignorance etc. [The five evils are: ignorance, egoism, attachment, aversion and clinging to life. (See P. Y. Su. 2.3)], the Lord says this:
8.18 With the coming of day all manifested things emerge from the Unmanifest and when night comes they merge in that itself which is called the Unmanifested.
8.18 Thus, at the dawn of a day of Brahma, the manifest entities existing in the three worlds, possessing body, senses, objects, and places of enjoyment appear from the non-manifest (Avyakta), which is the condition of Brahma's body in that state, and at the beginning of the night they are dissolved into the condition of the unevolved (Avyakta) which forms the body of Brahma then.
8.18 See Comment under 8.19
8.18 Ahar-agame, with the coming of day, at the time when Brahma wakes; sarvah vyaktayah, all manifested things, all things that get manifested, all creatures characterized as moving and non-moving; prabhavanti, emerge, become manifested; avyaktat, from the Unmanifested-avyakta (Unmanifested) is the state of sleep of Prajapati; from that avyakta.

(See P. Y. Su. 2.3)], the Lord says this:
8.19 This same multitude of beings, being born again and again, is dissolved, helplessly, O Arjuna (into the Unmanifested) at the coming of the night and comes forth at the coming of the day.
8.19 The same multitude of beings, which have lived on earth so often, all are dissolved as the night of the universe approaches, to issue forth anew when morning breaks. Thus is it ordained.
8.19. Being born and born again, the self same multitude of beings gets dissolved while the night approaches, and issues forth willy-nilly while the day approaches, O son of  Prtha !
8.19 O son of Prtha, after being born again and again, that very multitude of beings disappears in spite of itself at the approach of night. It comes to life at the approach of day.

8.19 This same multitude of beings, being born again and again, is dissolved, helplessly, O Arjuna (into the Unmanifested) at the coming of the night and comes forth at the coming of the day.

8.19 O son of Prtha, bhutva, after being born again and again at the approach of day; sah eva, that very-not any other; bhutagramah, multitude of beings, consisting of the moving and the non-moving objects that existed in the earlier cycle of creation; praliyate, disappears repeatedly; avasah, in spinte of itself, [For they are impelled by their own defects] without any independence whatever; ratri-agame, at the approach of night, at the close of the day. Prabhavati, it comes to life, verily in spite of itself; ahar-agame, at the approach of day.
The means for the attainment of that Immutable which was introduced has been pointed out in, 'He who departs by leaving the body while uttering the single syllable, viz Om, which is Brahman, ' etc. (13). Now, with a vies to indicating the real nature of that very Immutable, this is being said-that It is to be reached through this path of yoga:
8.19 O son of Prtha, after being born again and again, that very multitude of beings disappears in spite of itself at the approach of night. It comes to life at the approach of day.
8.19 The same multitude of beings, controlled by Karma, evolves again and again, undergoing dissolution at the coming of night. Again at the coming of the day it comes forth. Similarly, at the end of the life span of Brahma which consists of a hundred years of three hundred and sixty days each, each Brahma-day being a thousand Caturyugas, all the worlds including that of Brahma and Brahma himself dissolve into Me in accordance with the order thus described in the Srutis:  'The earth is dissolved into the waters, the waters are dissolved into light' etc., (Su. U., 2). The process of involution ends, after passing through all the other stages of dissolution, with the Avyakta, Akasa and Tamas. Therefore, for every other entity except Myself, origination and annihilation are unavoidable. So for those who seek Aisvarya (prosperity and power) birth and dissolution according to the above mentioned time arrangement are unavoidable. But in the case of those who attain to Me, there is no return again to Samsara. [The immense duration of time, according to ancient thinkers, is as follows:  Catur-yuga, or a unit of the four yugas of Krta, Treta, Dvapara and Kali, has a cumulative duration of 4,320,000 human years. A thousand such periods constitute a day time of Brahma and a similar period his night. Periodic creation and dissolution of the universe take place in these two periods respectively. One year of Brahma consists of 360 such diurnal period. A Brahma has a life-span of 100 such years - i.e., 311, 040, 000,000,000 human years. At the end of it, there is a Mahapralaya, and a new Brahma comes into being. Time thus goes on endlessly].

Now Sri Krsna teaches that there is no return to Samsara even for those who have attained Kaivalya (isolation of the self).
8.17-19 Sahasra-etc.,  upto  aharagama.  Those who could see afar  (great seers), see  [actually] the night and day even in the case of Brahma as being marked [respectively]  by the destruction and creation  [of the world].  Accordingly, having risen from sleep, the same   [Selves]  continue their own respective activities  every day; they theyselves, putting an end to their activities  every night,  remain exclusively in the form of Energy  [of the Absolute].  In this manner they come to  be again and again at the time of creation and of dissolution.  No new, but only the self-same personal  Souls are let loose.   Their mutual difference in the form of the idea of the long and short lives is based only on the concept of time.  This delimitation is unavoidable even in the case of the Prajapatis.  Hence it is established that they too are cetainly of the nature of having evolution and dissolution.						
 [The Lord]  clarifies His  [own]  statement :  'People do return from each and every world;  but having attained Me, the Supreme Lord, they do not do so.'
8.19 O son of Prtha, bhutva, after being born again and again at the approach of day; sah eva, that very-not any other; bhutagramah, multitude of beings, consisting of the moving and the non-moving objects that existed in the earlier cycle of creation; praliyate, disappears repeatedly; avasah, in spinte of itself, [For they are impelled by their own defects] without any independence whatever; ratri-agame, at the approach of night, at the close of the day. Prabhavati, it comes to life, verily in spite of itself; ahar-agame, at the approach of day.
The means for the attainment of that Immutable which was introduced has been pointed out in, 'He who departs by leaving the body while uttering the single syllable, viz Om, which is Brahman, ' etc. (13). Now, with a vies to indicating the real nature of that very Immutable, this is being said-that It is to be reached through this path of yoga:
8.2 Who and how is Adhiyajna here in this body, O destroyer of Madhu (Krishna)? And how at the time of death, art Thou to be known by the self-controlled?
8.2 Who is it who rules the spirit sacrifice in many; and at the time of death how may those who have learned self-control come to the knowledge of Thee?
8.2. Who is Lord-of-sacrifices (adhiyajna) [and] how ?  Who in this body ?  O slayer of Madhu !  How are You to be realised by the self-controlled ones at the time of their journey (i.e., death) also ?
8.2 O Madhusudana, how, and who, is the entity existing in the sacrifice here in this body? And at the time of death, how are You to be known by people of concentrated minds?

8.2 Who and how is Adhiyajna here in this body, O destroyer of Madhu (Krishna)? And how at the time of death, art Thou to be known by the self-controlled?

8.2 In order to settle these estions seriatim -
8.2 O Madhusudana, how, and who, is the entity existing in the sacrifice here in this body? And at the time of death, how are You to be known by people of concentrated minds?
8.1 8.2 Arjuna said  What are that brahman, Adhyatma and Karma which have been mentioned as what should be known by those who aspire for release from old age and death while they take refuge with the Lord?  What are Adhibuta and Adhidaiva, which should be known by the aspirants for wealth?  Who is Adhiyajna that is to be known by the three groups as their dying hour. In what manner are You to be known by these three groups who are self-controlled?
8.1-2 What has been introduced by the Bhagavat by saying 'They know that Brahmn etc.,'  [at the end of the last chapter],  the same  [the Sage] decides by raising nine estions  [as follows] :
 
Kim tad  Brahman etc.  Adhiyajnah etc.  Who and how is the adhiyajna ?  Who in this body ? :  'does  reside'  may be supplimented.
8.2 In order to settle these estions seriatim -
8.20 But verily there exists, higher than this Unmanifested, another unmanifested Eternal, which is not destroyed when all beings are destroyed.
8.20 In truth, therefore, there is the Eternal Unmanifest, which is beyond and above the Unmanifest Spirit of Creation, which is never destroyed when all these being perish.
8.20. But there exists another Being which is beyond this, and It is both manifest and unmanifest and is etnernal.  It is this Being that does not perish while all [the other]  beings perish.
8.20 But distinct from that Unmanifested is the other eternal unmainfest Reality, who does not get destroyed when all beings get destroyed.

8.20 But verily there exists, higher than this Unmanifested, another unmanifested Eternal, which is not destroyed when all beings are destroyed.

8.20 He is parah, distinct, different;-From what?-tasmat, from that aforesaid (Unmanifested).
The word tu, but, is meant for showing the distinction of the Immutable that is going to be spoken of from the Unmanifested.
He is bhavah, the Reality, the supreme Brahman called the Immutable.
 
Even though different, there is the possibility of similarlity of characteristics. Hence, for obviating this the Lord says: anyah, the other, of a different characteristic, and He is the Immutable which is beyond the range of the organs. It has been said that He is distinct from that. From what, again is He distinct? Avyaktat, from the Unmaifested spoken of earlier, which is the seed of the multitude of beings, and which is characterized as ignorance (avidya) [Ast. adds, 'anyah vilaksanah, bhavah ityabhiprayah: The meaning is that the Reality is different and distinct (form that Unmanifested).-Tr.] He is sanatnah, eternal.
Bhavah, the Reality; yah sah, who is such; na, does not; vinasyati, get destroyed; when sarvesu bhutesu, all beings, beginning from Brahma; nasyatsu, get destroyed.
8.20 But distinct from that Unmanifested is the other eternal unmainfest Reality, who does not get destroyed when all beings get destroyed.
8.20 - 8.21 Superior, as an object of human end, to this unmanifest (Avyakta), which is inanimate Prakrti, there is another state of being, of a kind different from this, but also called Avyakta. It has only knowledge-form and is also unmanifest. It is the self, Atman. It is unmanifest because It cannot be apprehended by any means of knowledge (Pramanas). The meaning is that Its nature is unie and that It can be known only to Itself. That is, It can be understood only vaguely in the ordinary ways of knowing. It is eternal, namely, ever-enduring, because It is not subject to origination and annihilation. In texts like 'For those who meditate on the imperishable, undefinable, the unmanifest' (12.3) and 'The imperishable is called the unchanging' (15.16) - that being the self. It has been called the unmanifest (Avyakta) and imperishable (Aksara); when all material elements like ether, etc., with their causes and effects are annihilated, the self is not annihilated in spite of It being found alone with all the elements. [The elements are what constitute the bodies of beings.]

The knowers of the Vedas declare It as the highest end. The meaning is that the imperishable entity which has been denoted by the term 'highest goal' in the passage, 'Whosoever abandons the body and departs (in the manner described) reaches the highest state (Dhama)' (8.13), is the self (Atman) abiding in Its essential nature free from the contact with the Prakrti. This self, which abides thus in Its essential nature, by attaining which It does not return, - this is My 'highest abode,' i.e., is the highest object of My control. The inanimate Prakrti is one object of My control. The animate Prakrti associated with this inanimate Prakrti is the second object of My control. The pristine nature of the freed self, free from contact with inanimate matter, is the highest object of My rule. Such is the meaning. This state is also one of non-return to Samsara. Or the term 'dhama' may signify 'luminosity'. And luminosity connotes knowledge. The essential nature of the freed self is boundless knowledge, or supreme light, which stands in contrast to the shrunken knowledge of the self, when involved in Prakrti. [The description given above is that of Kaivalya, the state of self-luminous existence as the pure self].

Sri Krsna now teaches that the object of attainment for the Jnanin, is totally different from this:
8.20 See Comment under 8.22
8.20 He is parah, distinct, different;-From what?-tasmat, from that aforesaid (Unmanifested).

Bhavah, the Reality; yah sah, who is such; na, does not; vinasyati, get destroyed; when sarvesu bhutesu, all beings, beginning from Brahma; nasyatsu, get destroyed.
8.21 What is called the Unmanifested and the Imperishable, That they say is the highest goal. They who reach It do not return (to this Samsara). That is My highest abode (place or state).
8.21 The wise say that the Unmanifest and Indestructible is the highest goal of all; when once That is reached, there is no return. That is My Blessed Home.
8.21. [The scriptures]  speak of This as Unmanifest and Changeless and declare  This is to be the highest Goal. Having attained which people do not return, this is My highest abode.
8.21 He who has been mentioned as the Unmanifested, the Immutable, they call Him the supreme Goal. That is the supreme abode of Mine, reaching which they do not return.

8.21 What is called the Unmanifested and the Imperishable, That they say is the highest goal. They who reach It do not return (to this Samsara). That is My highest abode (place or state).

8.21 He Himself who has been uktah, meantioned; as avyaktah, Unmanifest; the aksarah, Immutable; ahuh, they call; tam, Him-that very unmanifest Reality which is termed as the Immutable; the paramam, supreme; gatim, Goal. Tat, That; is the paramam, supreme; dhama, abode, i.e. the supreme State; mama, of Mine, of Visnu; yam prapya, reaching which Reality; na nivartante, they do not return to the worldly state.

8.22 That highest Purusha, O Arjuna, is attainable by unswerving devotion to Him alone within Whom all beings dwell and by Whom all this is pervaded.
8.22 O Arjuna! That Highest God, in Whom all beings abide, and Who pervades the entire universe, is reached only by wholehearted devotion. [The following material (between the asterisks) is an example of what may be a "doctored' inclusion. It does not jibe with the rest of the material because it is not presented as metaphor and clearly implies that worldly phenomena are spiritually determining. Maybe it was added by an individual or individuals who were less cognizant than the originating author. Or maybe was 'craftily' inserted to function as a sort of litmus test - those who get"taken in' by it may be recognized as not having "spiritual discernment'.]
8.22. The Supreme Soul.  O son of  Prtha, is attainable through devotion that admits no other things; having attained Which  Soul, the men of Yoga do not get birth again;  within Which exist the beings; and in Which everything is well established, O Arjuna !
8.22 O son of Prtha, that supreme Person-in whom are included (all) the beings and by whom all this is pervaded-is, indeed, reached through one-pointed devotion.

8.22 That highest Purusha, O Arjuna, is attainable by unswerving devotion to Him alone within Whom all beings dwell and by Whom all this is pervaded.

8.22 O son of Prtha, sah, that; parah purusah, supreme, unsurpassable Person-(the word purusa) derived in the sense of 'residing in the heart' or 'all-pervasiveness'; that Person, compared to whom there is nothing superior-; yasya, in whom, in which Person; antahsthani, are included; bhutani, (all) the beings which are Its products-for a product remains inherent in its cause; and yena, by whom, by which Person; tatam, is pervaded; sarvam, all; idam, this, the Universe, as pot etc. are by space; is tu, indeed; labhyah, reached; through ananyaya, one-pointed; bhaktya, through devotion, characterized as Knowledge; ananyaya, which is one pointed, which relates to the Self.
The Northern Path meant for the attainment of Braman by the yogis under discussion, who have superimposed the idea of Brahman on the syllable Om and who are destined to get Liberation in due course, has to be stated. Hence, in order to present the intended idea the verse, '(O best of the Bharata dynasty) of that time৷৷.at which,' etc. is being recited. The description of the Path of Return (in verse 25) is by way of praising the other Path (of Departure, in verse 24):
8.22 O son of Prtha, that supreme Person-in whom are included (all) the beings and by whom all this is pervaded-is, indeed, reached through one-pointed devotion.
8.22 That Supreme Person has been declared in such texts as 'There is nothing higher than Myself, O Arjuna. All this is strung on Me, as rows of gems are on a thread' (7.7), and 'Who am beyond them and immutable' (7.13) - He is the Supreme Person in whom all beings abide and by whom all this is pervaded. He is to be attained by undivided devotion as described in 'Whose mind is not in anything else' (8.14).

Now, Sri Krsna teaches the 'path of light,' described in the Srutis which is common to the knowers of the true nature of the self and to the persons who are devoted to the Supreme Person. The nature of this path is alified as one of 'non-return to Samsara.' In the case of a person journeying through the 'path of light,' as described in the text of the worship of Five Fires is as follows:  'So those who know It (i.e., the eternal nature of the individual self) thus, as taught in the Vidya of the Five Fires, and those too who worhip in the forest with faith and Tapas go to the deity ruling over the rays of light, and from there to the deity of the day' (Cha. U., 5.10.1). The attainment of the Supreme Brahman and the non-return to birth are declared with reference to those who go by the path of light, etc., by the teaching that 'He the Supreme Being leads them to Brahman ৷৷. Those who reach by this path do not return to the (wordly) life of man' (Cha. U., 4.15.5). This declaration of the goal in the text, 'Those who know it thus etc.,' is not with reference to the attainment of the Atman which constitutes ony the limb of the science of Brahman as taught in the beginning of Prajapati's teaching. For there will then arise purposelessness for the separate teaching of the same in regard to the principal science of the Supreme in the text. 'Those who are in the forest worship by means of faith and austerity etc.,' (Cha. U., 5.10.1). 

It is taught in the Vidya (meditation) of Five Fires:  'Thus, indeed, in the fifth oblation the waters become Purusa' (Cha. U., 5.9.1) and 'Those with a balance of good Karmas ৷৷. and those with a balance of bad Karmas' (Ibid., 5.10.7). What is to be understood here is that the state of existence as men and other beings, which has its origin in good and evil Karmas, refer to the 'waters' which alone are mixed with other elements (i.e., to the body-mind); as for the self, there is only contact with them and not identification. Thus, is declared the difference between intelligent self and inanimate matter. Then, by the texts, 'Those who know this' (Ibid., 5.10.1), 'Those who go to the rays of light' (Ibid.), and 'They who proceed by it return not to the human condition here,' it is instructed that those who know this concerning the sentient and inanimate entities - the one to be attained and the other to be rejected , they jourey along the path described by the terms 'beginning with light and do not return to Samsara'. On account of the passage, 'He leads them to the Brahman' (Ibid., 4.15.5), which holds that the Brahman is attained by both the knower of real nature of the self and the devotees of the Supreme Person and also because of the axiom of 'results according to efforts' (Tat-kratu-nyaya), the entity self, separated from the inanimate matter, should be constantly meditated upon as having its sole joy in absolute subservience to the Supreme Brahman who is Its self. The self's nature of finding only joy consists in absolute subservience to the Surpeme Person. This is proved from the Srutis like 'He who dwells within the self ৷৷. whose body is the self' (Sa. Bra., 14.6.5.5.30).
8.22 Parah  etc.  upto pratisthitam.  The Absolute  (Vasudevatattva) of the above description is beyond the concept of  Time Manifest :  [because]  It is immanent in all beings.  In spite of being  so,  It is  Unmanifest :  because  It is difficult  to attain.  That It is, however, attainable by means of devotion has also been made clear already.  In  This exists this universe which is  [Its] perennial nature that remains always the same.
 
Now,  what is the  meaning of the word, punah 'again'  and of the word avrtti 'returning' ?  This meaning certainly presupposes a conditon of disruption  of one's  own nature for sometime in the intervening period.  The auspicious  Supreme  Lord's real nature is His Absolute Freedom viz., the Supreme Consciousness that transcends  the universe, yet remains identical with the universe, and serves as the basis of the universe;  and It is perennial.  Hence, it cannot be assumed that there was some disruption at any time for this real nature and that the Supreme Lord regained that nature.  Hence it is rightly said  'Having  attained Me' etc.								
 So far the behaviour of those persons who attain the Bhagavat by constant practice without much labour has been described.  Now a difference that lies between  those who, by departing, will  (or attain)  emancipation and those who will enjoyment  [of mundane life],  is described :
8.22 O son of Prtha, sah, that; parah purusah, supreme, unsurpassable Person-(the word purusa) derived in the sense of 'residing in the heart' or 'all-pervasiveness'; that Person, compared to whom there is nothing superior-; yasya, in whom, in which Person; antahsthani, are included; bhutani, (all) the beings which are Its products-for a product remains inherent in its cause; and yena, by whom, by which Person; tatam, is pervaded; sarvam, all; idam, this, the Universe, as pot etc. are by space; is tu, indeed; labhyah, reached; through ananyaya, one-pointed; bhaktya, through devotion, characterized as Knowledge; ananyaya, which is one pointed, which relates to the Self.
The Northern Path meant for the attainment of Braman by the yogis under discussion, who have superimposed the idea of Brahman on the syllable Om and who are destined to get Liberation in due course, has to be stated. Hence, in order to present the intended idea the verse, '(O best of the Bharata dynasty) of that time৷৷.at which,' etc. is being recited. The description of the Path of Return (in verse 25) is by way of praising the other Path (of Departure, in verse 24):
8.23 Now I will tell thee, O chief of Bharatas, the times departing at which the Yogis will return or not return.
8.23 *Now I will tell thee, O Arjuna, of the times at which, if the mystics go forth, they do not return, and at which they go forth only to return.
8.23. Departing at what times the Yogins attain the non-return or the return only-those times I shall declare to you, O chief of  the Bharatas !
8.23 O best of the Bharata dynasty, I shall now speak of that time by departing at which the yogis attain the State of Non-return, and also (of the time by departing at which they attain) the State of Return.

8.23 Now I will tell thee, O chief of Bharatas, the times departing at which the Yogis will return or not return.

8.23 Bharatarsabha, O best of the Bharata dynasty; vaksyami, I shall speak; tu, now; tam, of that; kalam, time; prayatah, by departing, by dying; (-these words are to be which time; yoginah, the yogis; yanti, attain; anavrttim, the State of Non-return, of nonrirth; ca eva, and also; of the time by departing at which they attain its opposite, avrttim, the State of Return.
By 'Yogis' are implied both the yogis (men of meditation) and the men of acitons (rites and duties).
But the men of action are yogis by courtesy, in accordance with the description, 'through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' (3.3).
The Lord speaks of that time: [This is Ast.'s reading.-Tr.]
8.23 O best of the Bharata dynasty, I shall now speak of that time by departing at which the yogis attain the State of Non-return, and also (of the time by departing at which they attain) the State of Return.
8.23 - 8.24 Here, the term 'time' denotes a path, having many deities beginning with day and ending with year. The deities preside over divisions of time. The meaning is - I declare to you the path departing in which Yogins do not return and also the path departing in which the doers of good actions return. By the clause, 'Light in the form of fire, the day, bright fortnight, six months of the northern course,' year also is denoted.
8.23 Yatra etc.  The non-return :  emancipation.  The return :  i.e.,  for enjoying  [worldly life].									(23)
8.23 Bharatarsabha, O best of the Bharata dynasty; vaksyami, I shall speak; tu, now; tam, of that; kalam, time; prayatah, by departing, by dying; (-these words are to be which time; yoginah, the yogis; yanti, attain; anavrttim, the State of Non-return, of nonrirth; ca eva, and also; of the time by departing at which they attain its opposite, avrttim, the State of Return.

8.24 Fire, light daytime, the bright fortnight, the six months of the northern path of the sun (the northern solstice)  departing then (by these) men who know Brahman go to Brahman.
8.24 If knowing the Supreme Spirit the sage goes forth with fire and light, in the daytime, in the fortnight of the waxing moon and in the six months before the Northern summer solstice, he will attain the Supreme.
8.24. The northern course [of the sun]  consisting of six months, is fire, light, day and bright one. Departing in it, the Brahman-knowing men attain the Brahman .
8.24 Fire, light, daytime, the birght forrnight, the six months of the Northern solstice-by following this Path, persons who are knowers of Brahman attain Brahman when they die.

8.24 Fire, light daytime, the bright fortnight, the six months of the northern path of the sun (the northern solstice)  departing then (by these) men who know Brahman go to Brahman.

8.24 Agnih, fire-is a deity presiding over a period of time; similarly, jyotih, light-also is a deity presiding over a period of time. Or fire and light are the well-known Vedic deities.
As the expression 'mango grove' is used with regard to a place where mango trees are more numerous, similarly, the expressions 'at which time' and 'that time' (in the earlier verse) are used in view of the predominance (of the deities presiding over time). [If the first two (fire and light) are taken as Vedic deities, then the remaining three are the only deities of time. Still, the latter being numerically greater, all the five deities are referred to as deities of time. The deities of both the Paths-of gods and manes, or of the Northern and the Southern Paths as they are called-who are gods of time, are referred to here as 'time' by such words as day, fortnight, six months, etc.]
So also, ahah, daytime, means the deity of daytime. Suklah, the bright fortnight, implies the deity presiding over the bright fortnight. Sanmasah uttarayanam, the six months of the Northern solstice-here, too, is understood the deity presiding over the Path. This is the principle (of interpretation followed elsewhere (in the Upanisads also).
Tatra, following this Path; janah, persons; who are brahma-vidah, knowers of Brahman, those engaged in meditation on (the alified) Brahman; gacchanti, attain; brahma, Brahman; prayatah, when they die. It is understood that they attain Brahman through stages. Indeed, according to the Upanisadic text, 'His vital forces do not depart' (Br. 4.4.46), there is neither going nor coming back for those established in full realization, who are fit for immediate Liberation. Having their organs merged in Brahman, they are suffused with Brahman, they are verily identified with Brahman.

8.23 - 8.24 Here, the term 'time' denotes a path, having many deities beginning with day and ending with year. The deities preside over divisions of time.

8.25 Attaining to the lunar light by smoke, night time, the dark fortnight also, the six months of the southern path of the sun (the southern solstice), the Yogi returns.
8.25 But if he departs in gloom, at night, during the fortnight of the waning moon and in the six months before the Southern solstice, then he reaches but lunar light and he will be born again.
8.25. The southern course [of the sun], consisting of six months, is smoke, night, and also dark.  [Departing] in it,  the Yogin attains the moon's light and he returns.
8.25 Smoke, night, as also the dark fortnight and the six months of the Southern solstice-following this Path the yogi having reached the lunar light, returns.

8.25 Attaining to the lunar light by smoke, night time, the dark fortnight also, the six months of the southern path of the sun (the southern solstice), the Yogi returns.

8.25 Dhuman, smoke; and ratrih night, are the deities presiding over smoke and night. Similarly, krsnah, the dark fornight, means the deity of the dark fortnight. Just as before, by sanmasah daksinayanam the six months of the Southern solstice, also is verily meant a deity. Tatra, following this Path; yogi, the yogi who performs sacrifices etc., the man of actions; prapya, having reached; candramasam jyotih, the lunar light-having enjoyed the results (of his actions); nivartate, returns, on their exhaustion.
8.25 Smoke, night, as also the dark fortnight and the six months of the Southern solstice-following this Path the yogi having reached the lunar light, returns.
8.25 This denotes the world of the manes etc., described by the term 'starting with smoke.' Here the term Yogin connotes one associated with good actions.
8.24-25 Agnih etc. Dhumah etc.  Northern :  upper  (or upward).  Course :  the one taken  [by the sun] during the period of six months.  This course, on account of its illuminating nature, is figuratively described by the words denoting fire etc., and the course,  contrary to this, by opposite terms.  This course is intercepted with the lunar parts of enjoyment.  Hence [it leads to] the return for enjoyment.
8.25 Dhuman, smoke; and ratrih night, are the deities presiding over smoke and night. Similarly, krsnah, the dark fornight, means the deity of the dark fortnight. Just as before, by sanmasah daksinayanam the six months of the Southern solstice, also is verily meant a deity. Tatra, following this Path; yogi, the yogi who performs sacrifices etc., the man of actions; prapya, having reached; candramasam jyotih, the lunar light-having enjoyed the results (of his actions); nivartate, returns, on their exhaustion.
8.26 The bright and the dark paths of the world are verily thought to be eternal; by the one (the bright path) a man goes not to return and by the other (the dark path) he returns.
8.26 These bright and dark paths out of the world have always existed. Whoso takes the former, returns not; he who chooses the latter, returns.*
8.26. For, these two bright and dark courses are considered to be perpetual for the world.  One attains the non-return by the first of these, and one returns back by the other one.
8.26 These two courses of the world, which are white and black, are verily considered eternal. By the one a man goes to the State of Non-return; by the other he returns again.

8.26 The bright and the dark paths of the world are verily thought to be eternal; by the one (the bright path) a man goes not to return and by the other (the dark path) he returns.

8.26 Ete, these two; gati, courses; jagatah, of the world; which are sukla-krsne, white and black [The Northern Path (the path of the Gods), and the Southern Path (the Path of the Manes) respectively.]-white because it is a revealer of Knowlege, and black because there is absence of that (revelation); are hi, verily; mate, considered; sasvate, eternal, because the world is eternal. These two courses are possible for those who are alified for Knowledge and for rites and duties; not for everybody. This being so, ekaya, by the one, by the white one; yati, a man goes; anavrttim, to the State of Non-return; anyaya, by the other; avartate, he returns; punah, again.
8.26 These two courses of the world, which are white and black, are verily considered eternal. By the one a man goes to the State of Non-return; by the other he returns again.
8.26 The bright path is characterised by the terms 'starting with light.' The dark path is characterised by the 'terms starting with smoke.' By the bright path a man goes to the plane of no-return, but he who goes by the dark path returns again. In the Sruti both the bright and dark paths are said to be eternal in relation to Jnanis and doers of good actions of many kinds. This is corroborated in the text:  'Those who know this and those who worship with faith do Tapas in the forest etc., they go to the light' (Cha. U., 5.10.1), and 'But those who in the village perform Vedic and secular acts of a meritorious nature and the giving of alms - they pass to the smoke' (ibid., 5.10.3).
8.26 Sukla-krsne etc.  By  the first of these two courses the non-return i.e.,  the liberation is attained, and by the other, the enjoyment  [of the mundane life].
8.26 Ete, these two; gati, courses; jagatah, of the world; which are sukla-krsne, white and black [The Northern Path (the path of the Gods), and the Southern Path (the Path of the Manes) respectively.]-white because it is a revealer of Knowlege, and black because there is absence of that (revelation); are hi, verily; mate, considered; sasvate, eternal, because the world is eternal. These two courses are possible for those who are alified for Knowledge and for rites and duties; not for everybody. This being so, ekaya, by the one, by the white one; yati, a man goes; anavrttim, to the State of Non-return; anyaya, by the other; avartate, he returns; punah, again.
8.27 Knowing these paths, O Arjuna, no Yogi is deluded; therefore at all times be steadfast in Yoga.
8.27 O Arjuna! The saint knowing these paths is not confused. Therefore meditate perpetually.
8.27. O son of Prtha, not a single Yogin, knowing these two courses, gets deluded.  Therefore, O Arjuna, be practising Yoga connected with all times.
8.27 O son of Prtha, no yogi [One steadfast in meditation.) whosoever has known these two courses becomes deluded. Therefore, O Arjuna, be you steadfast in yoga at all times.

8.27 Knowing these paths, O Arjuna, no Yogi is deluded; therefore at all times be steadfast in Yoga.

8.27 O son of Prtha, na kascana yogi, no yogi whosoever; janan, has known; ete srti, these two courses as described-that one leads to worldly life, and the other to Liberation; muhyati, becomes deluded. Tasmat, therefore; O Arjuna, bhava, be you; yoga-yuktah, steadfast in Yoga; sarvesu kalesu, at all times.
Here about the greatness of that yoga:
8.27 O son of Prtha, no yogi [One steadfast in meditation.) whosoever has known these two courses becomes deluded. Therefore, O Arjuna, be you steadfast in yoga at all times.
8.27 Having known these two paths, no Yogin is deluded. On the contrary, he goes by the path of gods, his own path. Therefore, be integrated every day with Yoga called meditation on the path described by the terms starting with light.

Next Sri Krsna speaks of the fruit of knowing the import of the Sastras, as taught in the two chapters 7 and 8.
8.27 Naite etc.  The idea here is this :  [That  Yogin does not get deluded]  who knows  these two courses by adopting 'the internal method' ,  approved by the  [school of]  Yoga practice.  This point, if explained in detain, would lengthen our treatise.  Hence let us stop  here.  Therefore  etc.  Whatsoever are the  [units of]  time that are internal let one practise  the Yoga that is concerned with them all. 
 
Our preceptors have however said as :   So far the peculiarity in the passing away  [of the Yogins],  as indicated by the internal times, has been described, in the middle of the discourse,  for the benefit of one and all.  Having done this, now the chief  topic, under consideration, regarding the external units of times, is being wound up by the words  'Therefore, concerned with all times etc.'
8.27 O son of Prtha, na kascana yogi, no yogi whosoever; janan, has known; ete srti, these two courses as described-that one leads to worldly life, and the other to Liberation; muhyati, becomes deluded. Tasmat, therefore; O Arjuna, bhava, be you; yoga-yuktah, steadfast in Yoga; sarvesu kalesu, at all times.
Here about the greatness of that yoga:
8.28 Whatever fruit of merit is declared (in the scriptures) to accrue from (the study of) the Vedas, (the performance of) sacrifices, (the practice of) austerities, and gifts  beyond all this goes the Yogi, having known this; and he attains to the Supreme Primeval (first or ancient) Abode.
8.28 The sage who knows this passes beyond all merit that comes from the study of the scriptures, from sacrifice, from austerities and charity, and reaches the Supreme Primeval Abode."
8.28. Having understood all this, the  Yogin goes beyond whatever fruit of merit is ordained [in the scriptures]  in case the Vedas [are recited], the sacrifices [performed], the austerities [observed], and also gifts [donated]; and he goes to the Supreme Primeval Abode.
8.28 Having known this, the yogi transcends all those results of rigtheous deeds that are declared with regard to the Vedas, sacrifices, austerities and also charities, and he reaches the primordial supreme State.

8.28 Whatever fruit of merit is declared (in the scriptures) to accrue from (the study of) the Vedas, (the performance of) sacrifices, (the practice of) austerities, and gifts  beyond all this goes the Yogi, having known this; and he attains to the Supreme Primeval (first or ancient) Abode. 
8.28 Viditva, having known; idam, this-having fully ascertained and practised what was spoken in the course of determining the answers to the seven estions (put by Arjuna in verse 1 and 2); the yogi atyeti, transcends, goes beyond; tat sarvam, all those; punya-phalam, results of righteous deeds, aggregate of rewards; yat, that are; pradistam, declared by the scriptures; with regard to these,viz vedesu, with regard to teh Vedas which have been properly [Sitting facing eastward after having washed one's hands, face, etc.] studied; yajnesu, with regard to sacrifices performed together with their accessories; tapahsu, with regard to austerities practised correctly [With concentrated mind, intellect, etc.]; ca eva, and also; danesu, with regard to charities rightly [Taking into consideration place, time and fitness of the recipient.] given; and upaiti, he reaches; the param, supreme; sthanam, State of God; adyam, which is primordial, the Cause that existed in the beginning, i.e. Brahman.
8.28 Having known this, the yogi transcends all those results of rigtheous deeds that are declared with regard to the Vedas, sacrifices, austerities and also charities, and he reaches the primordial supreme State.
8.28 Whatever fruit is said to accrue for meritorious actions in the form of the regular study of the Vedas Rg, Yajus, Saman and Atharvan as also for the performance of sacrifices, austerities, gifts - all these does not transcend on knowing this, namely the greatness of the Lord as taught in the two chapters (7 and 8). By immense joy arising from the knowledge of this, he regards all these results as negligible as straw. Be being a Yogin, viz., a Jnanin, he reaches the supreme, primal abode which is without beginning and is attainable by such a Jnanin.
8.28 Vedesu etc. He goes beyond : he humiliates, because he, by his [constant] remembrance of the Bhagavat, neutralizes all the mental impression of all the activities.  When all the actions (their mental impressions) are destroyed, he easily attains the Supreme Siva.
8.28 Viditva, having known; idam, this-having fully ascertained and practised what was spoken in the course of determining the answers to the seven estions (put by Arjuna in verse 1 and 2); the yogi atyeti, transcends, goes beyond; tat sarvam, all those; punya-phalam, results of righteous deeds, aggregate of rewards; yat, that are; pradistam, declared by the scriptures; with regard to these,viz vedesu, with regard to teh Vedas which have been properly [Sitting facing eastward after having washed one's hands, face, etc.] studied; yajnesu, with regard to sacrifices performed together with their accessories; tapahsu, with regard to austerities practised correctly [With concentrated mind, intellect, etc.]; ca eva, and also; danesu, with regard to charities rightly [Taking into consideration place, time and fitness of the recipient.] given; and upaiti, he reaches; the param, supreme; sthanam, State of God; adyam, which is primordial, the Cause that existed in the beginning, i.e. Brahman.
8.3 The Blessed Lord said  Brahman is the Imperishable, the Supreme; Its essential nature is called Self-knowledge; the offering (to the gods) which causes existence and manifestation of beings and which also sustains them is called action.
8.3 The Lord Shri Krishna replied: The Supreme Spirit is the Highest Imperishable Self, and Its Nature is spiritual consciousness. The worlds have been created and are supported by an emanation from the Spirit which is called the Law.
8.3. The Bhagavat said  The immutable Absolute is the Brahman.  Its intrinsic nature is called  the Lord of the self. The emitting activity that causes the birth of both the animate and the inanimate is named  'action '.
8.3 The Blessed Lord said  The Immutable is the supreme Brahman; self-hood is said to the entity present in the individual plane. By action is meant the offerings which bring about the origin of the existence of things.

8.3 The Blessed Lord said  Brahman is the Imperishable, the Supreme; Its essential nature is called Self-knowledge; the offering (to the gods) which causes existence and manifestation of beings and which also sustains them is called action.

8.3 Aksaram means that which does not perish (na ksarati), the supreme Self. This agrees with the Upanisadic text, 'Under the mighty rule of this Immutable, O Gargi৷৷.' (Br. 3.8.9). And (the letter) Om is not accept here [as the meaning of aksara (lit. letter)], because of its being mentioned (as a letter) later on in, 'The single letter Om, which is Brahman' (13). Besides, the adjective 'supreme' is more apporpriate with regard to the absolute, immutable Brahman.
By svabhava, self-hood, is meant the eixtence of that very supreme Brahman in every body as the indwelling Self. Svabhavah ucyate, self-hood is said to be, is referred to by the word; adhyatmam, the entity which, as the indwelling Self, exists in the body (atma) by making it its habitat (adhikrtya), and which in the ultimate analysis is the supreme Brahman.
Visargah, the offerings, the giving away to gods of things like porridge [Caru: An oblations of rice, barley and pulse boiled-together to be offered to gods.], cake, etc.; bhuta-bhava-udbhava-karah, which bring about the origin of the existence of things; is karma-sanjnitah, meant by action. This sacrifice consisting in pouring of oblations is called action. The existence (bhava) of (moving and nonmoving) things (bhuta) is bhuta-bhava. The coming into being (udbhava) of that (existence) is bhuta-bhava-udbhavah. That which causes (karoti) this is bhuta-bhava-udbhava-karah, i.e. the originator of existing things. It is needed from this source that all bengs, moving and non-moving, originate thorugh the successive processes of railfall etc. (see 3.14-15).
8.3 The Blessed Lord said  The Immutable is the supreme Brahman; self-hood is said to the entity present in the individual plane. By action is meant the offerings which bring about the origin of the existence of things.
8.3 The Lord said  That which is the Supreme Imperishable (Aksara) has been named 'that brahman' The Aksara is that which cannot be destroyed and forms the totality of all individual selves. The Srutis say to this effect:  'The Avyakta is dissolved into the Aksara, the Aksara is dissolved into Tamas' (Su. U., 2). The supreme Aksara is the essential form of the self, separated from Prakrti. One's own material nature (the body) is spoken of as Adhyatma or that which dwells with the self. This material nature (Svabhava) is Prakrti. It does not form the self but attaches itself to the self in the form of subtle elements, impressions etc. This has been taught in the Vidya of Five Fires (Cha. U., 5). Both these (the Aksara and the Adhyatma) should be known by the aspirants for liberation (Kaivalya) - the former as what should be attained and the latter as what should be relinished.

Karma is that force which produces the origination of mundane beings. 'Beings' here means beings such as the human beings. The creative force which produces their origination is contact with woman. It has been described in the Sruti passage thus:  'The waters sacrificed in the fifth oblations become those who are named Purusas' (Cha. U., 5.3.3). That creative force is called Karma. All the acts associated with that should be considered by aspirants after release as calling for abstention. This abstention will also be inculcated immediately in the text, 'Desiring which they practise the vow of continence' (8.11).
8.3 Aksaram etc.  the Supreme is  [called]  Brahman because It is big and causes everything to grow  [in It].  On the same ground, what is  termed  'as the  Lord-of-self'  is that thing which bears the name  Consciousness which never ceases to be in It  (Brahman)  and which is nothing but the Brahman  (svah bhavah).  This  Brahman,  which is nothing but Consciousness, embraces the Power of  [creating] the universe because of Its unlimited aspect of being  external;  and on account of  Its freedom in the form of supremacy there arises the emitting  (i.e. creative)  activity [in it]  in the form of manifesting Itself as the external inanimate beings and also as various external animate ones.  [These two aspects of]  this activity cause respectively the birth of  the inanimate beings - i.e. the insentient beings, and the animate ones i.e. the sentient beings like Brahman etc.  [In other words],  It manifests as varigated  insentient and sentient beings.
 
Again this activity bestows on what is real, its intrinsic nature i.e.  creates a reality for the one from which all that is false is excluded.  this emitting activity is what is known as  'action'.
8.3 Aksaram means that which does not perish (na ksarati), the supreme Self. This agrees with the Upanisadic text, 'Under the mighty rule of this Immutable, O Gargi৷৷.' (Br. 3.8.9). And (the letter) Om is not accept here [as the meaning of aksara (lit. letter)], because of its being mentioned (as a letter) later on in, 'The single letter Om, which is Brahman' (13). Besides, the adjective 'supreme' is more apporpriate with regard to the absolute, immutable Brahman.
By svabhava, self-hood, is meant the eixtence of that very supreme Brahman in every body as the indwelling Self. Svabhavah ucyate, self-hood is said to be, is referred to by the word; adhyatmam, the entity which, as the indwelling Self, exists in the body (atma) by making it its habitat (adhikrtya), and which in the ultimate analysis is the supreme Brahman.
Visargah, the offerings, the giving away to gods of things like porridge [Caru: An oblations of rice, barley and pulse boiled-together to be offered to gods.], cake, etc.; bhuta-bhava-udbhava-karah, which bring about the origin of the existence of things; is karma-sanjnitah, meant by action. This sacrifice consisting in pouring of oblations is called action. The existence (bhava) of (moving and nonmoving) things (bhuta) is bhuta-bhava. The coming into being (udbhava) of that (existence) is bhuta-bhava-udbhavah. That which causes (karoti) this is bhuta-bhava-udbhava-karah, i.e. the originator of existing things. It is needed from this source that all bengs, moving and non-moving, originate thorugh the successive processes of railfall etc. (see 3.14-15).
8.4 Adhibhuta (knowledge of the elements) pertains to My perishable Nature and the Purusha or the Soul is the Adhidaiva; I alone am the Adhiyajna here in this body, O best among the embodied (men).
8.4 Matter consists of the forms that perish; Divinity is the Supreme Self; and He who inspires the spirit of sacrifice in man, O noblest of thy race, is I Myself, Who now stand in human form before thee.
8.4. The changing nature is the lord of the material beings;  the Person alone is the lord of the divinites; I am alone the Lord of  sacrifices and I, the best of the embodied (Souls), dwell in this body.
8.4 The which exists in the physical plane is the mutable entity, and what exists in the divine plane is the Person. O best among the embodied beings, I Myself am the entity that exists in the sacrifice in this body.

8.4 Adhibhuta (knowledge of the elements) pertains to My perishable Nature and the Purusha or the Soul is the Adhidaiva; I alone am the Adhiyajna here in this body, O best among the embodied (men).

8.4 Adhibhutam, that which exists in the physical plane, i.e. that which exists by comprising all creatures;-what is it?-it consists of the ksarah bhavah, mutable entity. Ksarah is that which is mutable, which is destructible; bhavah means anything whatsoever that has orgination. This is meaning.
Purusah means the Person, derived in the sense of he by whom all things are pervaded; or, he who lies in every heart. He is Hiranyagarbha, who resides in the Sun and sustains the organs of all creatures. He is adhi-daivatam, the entity existing in the divine plane.
Deha-bhrtam-vara, O best among the embodied beings; adhiyajnah, the entity existing in sacrifices, is the Deity, called Visnu, presiding over all sacrifices-which agrees with the Vedic text, 'Sacrifice is indeed Vishu' (Tai, Sam. 1.7.4). Aham eva, I Myself, who am that very Visnu; am adhiyajnah, the entity existing in the sacrifice; which is going on atra dehe, in this body. Since a sacrfice is performed with body, therefore it is closely associated with the body. In this sense it is said to be going on in the body.
8.4 The which exists in the physical plane is the mutable entity, and what exists in the divine plane is the Person. O best among the embodied beings, I Myself am the entity that exists in the sacrifice in this body.
8.4 The perishable existences which have been declared as fit to be known by the seekers of wealth, power etc., form the Adhibhuta. They are superior material entities that remain in ether or space and other elements. They are the evolutes of material elements and are perishable in their nature. They are also of the nature of sound, touch etc., supported by their basic subtle elements but different from, and finer than, ordinary sound etc., and are of many kinds. Sound, touch, form, taste and smell on this kind, which are manifold and rooted in their several bases, are to be gained by the seekers after prosperity and should be contemplated upon by them.

Adhidaivata connotes Purusa. The Purusa is superior to divinities like Indra, Prajapati and others, and is the experiencer of sound etc., which are different from, and superior to, the multitude of enjoyments of Indra, Prajapati etc. The condition of being such an enjoyer is to be contemplated upon by the seekers after prosperity, as the end to be attained.

I alone am connoted by the term Adhiyajna (sacrifice). Adhiyajna denotes one who is propitiated in sacrifices. Indra and others, to whom sacrifices are made, form My body. I dwell as their Self and I alone am the object of worship by sacrifice. In this manner the three groups of alified devotees should contemplate at the time of the practice of periodical and occasional rituals like the great sacrificies.

This is also common to all the three groups of devotees.
8.4 Adhibhutam etc.  The world of material  beings,  like  pot etc.,  is of changing nature,  because it flows or  gushes forth with its innate nature of changes etc.  Person :  Self.  It is the lord of the devinities, as all deities are established in It (or all deities get their perfections in It).  On the same reason it is only  Myself, the Supreme  Soul,  Who remain lording - as an enjoyer of sacrifice in its entirty - over sacrifices i.e. actions that are to be performed inevitably;  and it is  I only Who dwell in the body.  Thus, a pair of estions have been decided by single effort.   									
 Now, the other estion that remains to be answered viz.,  'How are You to be realised at the time of departure ?',  the Lord decides as :
8.4 Adhibhutam, that which exists in the physical plane, i.e. that which exists by comprising all creatures;-what is it?-it consists of the ksarah bhavah, mutable entity. Ksarah is that which is mutable, which is destructible; bhavah means anything whatsoever that has orgination. This is meaning.
Purusah means the Person, derived in the sense of he by whom all things are pervaded; or, he who lies in every heart. He is Hiranyagarbha, who resides in the Sun and sustains the organs of all creatures. He is adhi-daivatam, the entity existing in the divine plane.
Deha-bhrtam-vara, O best among the embodied beings; adhiyajnah, the entity existing in sacrifices, is the Deity, called Visnu, presiding over all sacrifices-which agrees with the Vedic text, 'Sacrifice is indeed Vishu' (Tai, Sam. 1.7.4). Aham eva, I Myself, who am that very Visnu; am adhiyajnah, the entity existing in the sacrifice; which is going on atra dehe, in this body. Since a sacrfice is performed with body, therefore it is closely associated with the body. In this sense it is said to be going on in the body.
8.5 And whosoever, leaving the body, goes forth remembering Me alone, at the time of death, he attains My Being: there is no doubt about this.
8.5 Whosoever at the time of death thinks only of Me, and thinking thus leaves the body and goes forth, assuredly he will know Me.
8.5. Whosoever, at the time of death also remembering Me alone, sets forth by abandoning his body [behind],  he attains My being.  There is no doubt about it.
8.5 And at the time of death, anyone who departs by giving up the body while thinking of Me alone, he attains My state. There is no doubt about this.

8.5 And whosoever, leaving the body, goes forth remembering Me alone, at the time of death, he attains My Being: there is no doubt about this.

8.5 Ca, and ; anta-kale, at the time of death; yah, anyone who; prayati, departs; muktva, by giving up; the kalevaram, body; smaran, while thinking; mam eva, of Me alone, who am the supreme Lord Visnu; sah, he; yati, attains; madhavam, My state, the Reality that is Vishu, Asti, there is; na, no; samsayah, doubt; atra, about this, in this regard, as to whether he attains (Me) or not.
'This rule does not apply in relation to me alone.' 'What then?'
8.5 And at the time of death, anyone who departs by giving up the body while thinking of Me alone, he attains My state. There is no doubt about this.
8.5 He who, at the last moment, while leaving the body, departs remembering Me alone, attains My being; he attains My condition. In whatever way he meditates on Me, he attains that very form, in the same manner as the royal sage Bharata attained the form of the deer remembered by him at death. Such is the meaning.

Sri Krsna further elucidates that it is the nature of one's last thought that leads to the attainment of a similar form by the meditator:
8.5 See Comment under 8.7
8.5 Ca, and ; anta-kale, at the time of death; yah, anyone who; prayati, departs; muktva, by giving up; the kalevaram, body; smaran, while thinking; mam eva, of Me alone, who am the supreme Lord Visnu; sah, he; yati, attains; madhavam, My state, the Reality that is Vishu, Asti, there is; na, no; samsayah, doubt; atra, about this, in this regard, as to whether he attains (Me) or not.
'This rule does not apply in relation to me alone.' 'What then?'
8.6 Whosoever at the end leaves the body, thinking of any being, to that being only does he go, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), because of his constant thought of that being.
8.6 On whatever sphere of being the mind of a man may be intent at the time of death, thither he will go.
8.6. And also remembering whatever being, a person leaves his body at the end [of his life], that being alone he attains, O son of Kunti !  [Because] he has been constantly thinking about that being.
8.6 O son of Kunti, thinking of any entity whichever it may be one gives up the body at the end, he attains that very one, having been always engrossed in its thought.

8.6 Whosoever at the end leaves the body, thinking of any being, to that being only does he go, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), because of his constant thought of that being.

8.6 O Son of Kunti, smaran, thinking of; bhavam, any entity, any particular deity; yam yam va api, which ever it may be; tyajati, one gives up; the kalevaram, body; ante, at the end, at the time of the departure of life; eti, he attains; tam tam eva, that very one, that very entity which is remembered-none else; having been sada, always; tadbhava-bhavitah, engrossed in its thought. Engrossment in it is tad-bhavah; one by whom that is remembered as a matter of habitual recollection is tadbhava-bhavitah.
Since the last thought is thus the cause of aciring the next body-
8.6 O son of Kunti, thinking of any entity whichever it may be one gives up the body at the end, he attains that very one, having been always engrossed in its thought.
8.6 'At the end,' at the time of death, remembering whatsoever thought one abandones the body, to that alone one goes after death. The final thought arises only with reference to objects pervioulsy ruminated upon in one's thought.

As the final thought results only about an object previously contemplated upon,
8.6 See Comment under 8.7
8.6 O Son of Kunti, smaran, thinking of; bhavam, any entity, any particular deity; yam yam va api, which ever it may be; tyajati, one gives up; the kalevaram, body; ante, at the end, at the time of the departure of life; eti, he attains; tam tam eva, that very one, that very entity which is remembered-none else; having been sada, always; tadbhava-bhavitah, engrossed in its thought. Engrossment in it is tad-bhavah; one by whom that is remembered as a matter of habitual recollection is tadbhava-bhavitah.
Since the last thought is thus the cause of aciring the next body-
8.7 Therefore at all times remember Me only and fight. With mind and intellect fixed (or absorbed) in Me, thou shalt doubtessly come to Me alone.
8.7 Therefore meditate always on Me, and fight; if thy mind and thy reason be fixed on Me, to Me shalt thou surely come.
8.7. Therefore at all times keep Me in the mind and also fight;  then, having your mind and intellect dedicated to Me, you will doubtlessly attain Me alone.
8.7 Therefore, think of Me at all times and fight. There is no doubt that by dedicating your mind and intellect to Me, you will attain Me alone.

8.7 Therefore at all times remember Me only and fight. With mind and intellect fixed (or absorbed) in Me, thou shalt doubtessly come to Me alone.

8.7 Tasmat, therefore; anusmara, think of; mam, Me, in the way prescribed by the scriptures; sarvesu kalesu, at all times; and yudhya, fight, engage your-self in war, which is your own (caste) duty. Asamsayah, there is no doubt in this matter; that arpita-mano-buddhih, by dedicating your mind and intellect; mayi; to Me; esyasi, you-you who have thus dedicated our mind and intellect to Me, Vasudeva-will attain; mam eva, Me alone, as I shall be remembered. [When the Lord instructs Arjuna to think of Him, and at the same time engage in war, it may seem that He envisages a combination of Knowledge and action. But this is not so, because when one thinks of all actions, accessories and results that come within the purview of the mind and the intellect as Brahman, it is denied that actions etc. have any separate reality apart from Brahman. Therefore no combination is involved here.]
Besides,
8.7 Therefore, think of Me at all times and fight. There is no doubt that by dedicating your mind and intellect to Me, you will attain Me alone.
8.7 Therefore, at all times, until your departure, remember Me, day after day. Engage yourself in actions appropriate to your station and stage in life, which would make you remember Me.

These actions are prescribed by the Srutis and Smrtis and comprise the periodical and occasional rites. Thus, by this means, with your mind and intellect set on Me, you will remember Me at the time of death and thus attain to Me in the manner desired by you. There is no doubt about this.

Thus, having laid down the common principle that the attainment of one's end is dependent on one's last thought, Sri Krsna proceeds to describe different modes of contemplation (Upasana) to be practised by the three groups of devotees for aciring their objectives. Of these, he first speaks about the modes of contemplation to be adopted by the seekers of enjoyments and power and the type of the last thought consistent with their contemplation.
8.5-7 Antakale etc.,  upto asamsayam.  At the time of departure also :  i.e., not only as longs as  [one is] in the healthy and unmolested condition.  Me alone :  Me, with all  attributes undistinguished. But at  the  time of  unhealthy state  (at the time of  death) of a person, how cloud the Bhagavat enter the path of his memory, when all the activities of the senses of that person have totally ended ?  Hence  [to achieve this result the Lord]  teaches also the means or device by  'Therefore' etc.:  The Bhagavat  surely, on His own accord, becomes  [even at the time of death] the object of memory of that person from whose heart (mind) the Bhagavat has never gone away in any cirucumstance connected with the mundane life also;  who has [thus]  renounced all his actions to the Bhagavat alone; and who is full of  (fully absorbed in) the Bhagavat.  For this end, the means is to remain constantly absorbed in the thought of the Bhagavat.  That is why  He Says : 'With whatever object the internal organ of a person is filled up always, that object alone is remembered by him at the time of death, and the state of that being alone is attained [by him].  Hence, let a person, by all means, have Me alone as his goal and be desirous of attaining Me'.  This is the idea here.
 
The idea  [intended here] is certainly not  'What is remembered, without fail, at the last moment that being alone is attained by him'.  Because in that case the attainment of the man of wisdom would also be just like that of an ignorant man.  For, the former too  [at the time of death] gets  [complete] dulness of mind that is benumbed by the disorder  (or defect) of he elements existing in his entire body.  Certainly it is not proper to accept this here.  For, it would go agains the authority of the scriptures.  For, the fact is-
 
'He who has attained liberation simultaneously with realisation  [of the Self],  and whose sorrows [therefore] have been destroyed - he attains completely unity [with the Absolute]  even though [at the time of death]  he has lost his memory and abandons his body in a sacred place or in the house of a dog-cooker  (i.e., man of a low tribe)'.  (PS, 83).
 
Therefore the matter-of-fact statement  (or explanation) and injunction  [that are meant here]  are the following :
 
If a person's internal organ is absorbed incessantly in the thought of a particular being, the same being is attained by him at end after departure.  It is immaterial  whether  [at the time of departure]  that being is remembered or  not.  This  secondary importance  [of the remembrance] is indicated by the word api  'also'.  The word va  'or'  makes it clear that the rememberance does not exist in each  and every case.  The Sage  (Vyasa) himself clarifies his idea  'Let a man always remain by all means  keeping Me  (the Absolute Lord)  as  his  supreme  goal'.  Since the Sage says :  'Therefore at all times keep Me  (the Absolute)  in your mind'.  Therefore, the following is the combination of words [of the verse intended here] :
 
If a person, remembering always, or at the last moment - the use of or denotes  'or not remembering  [at the last moment]' - a particular  being, leaves his body, he attains that particular being alone.  For, he is always absorbed in the thought of that being.
 
But others  [interpret the verses as follows] :  When one leaves his body as the end, just at the moment of leaving the body i.e., at that moment which is not cognizable to the perceivers like relatives, sons etc.  [standing nearby]; at that moment  that comes last after the limb-movements, like  [heavy] breathing, exertion, hiccup, convulsive utterance etc.,  [have endred]; at that fraction of time when the bondage of pleasure, pain and bewilderment is weakened as a result of the weakening of the control of the bodily strength;  at that time that goes by the term dehatyajana  'the moment of casting the body off'; at that moment whatsoever being a person remembers, his nature becomes entriely identical with that being, favoured  (taken as an object) by the First  Consiousness. the cause for remembering  [the Lord] at that moment is to remanin ever absorbed in the thought of Him.  The word tyajati  [of verse 6] is to be construed as the seventh case  [meaning  'at the time of abandoning']. Hence, the purport  [of the passage] is  only what has been said above.
 
What is the use of  such a remembrance of Him at the  last moment ?  But, who told that  [there] is a use [for it] ?  But,  the remembrance  is certainly brought about as a natural course at the last moment.
 
But this [proposition] would lead to an undersirable conseence.  For, it has been observed that  a person  [usually] remberances at the last moment either the maintenance of his children, wife and  relatives, or drinking of cold water and so on.  So, he would become identical with those things.
 
It is not so.  The moment, you speak of, is not the last moment.  For, at that moment the existence of body is being clearly felt.  Really that last moment, which we would like to speak of, can't be perceived by persons like you.  In what form alone the remembrance should be there at the last moment is decided by  [its cause], a  potential mental impression certainly arising at that time - even though it is far off - according to the general principle :
 
'The remembrance and the potential mental impression  [that causes it] being identical in form, there should be a seential  immediacy  [between them],  even though they are removed [from one another] by many births, by long distance and by long passage of time'.  (YS, IV, 9).
 
Thus, depending on the potential mental impression, there arises remembrance of a particular being, and becuase of its remembrance one attains the identity of that being.
 
However in the case of certain body the same [process] is accidentally indicated even at the stage of healthy body-condition.  See for example, the remembrance of a deer etc.,  [both in the healthy conditions and in the dying moment] and the conseential attainment of the deerhood, as described  in the  Puranic literature.  That is why api ca  'and also' is employed in [the statement] like  'and also at the time of journey.'  Therefore, those who constantly think of the Bhagavat with intention  'Let us become this Being';  they attain [in the following order] the identity with Absolute Lord, of the exclusive nature of  Consciousness :  [First] there arises the thought  (smarana) of  the Lord at the moment when the bodily existence is felt;  then at that unperceivable last moment the potential mental impression, born of the said thought, gives rise to the remembrance of the Lord by striking down all the other potential mental impressions, according to the principle :
 
'The potential mental impression, born therefrom , make all other potential mental impressions powerless   (YS., I, 50).
 
Then only at the moment of the fall of the body, because at that time the mental impression created by  [the sense of] time has  come to an end and because the differences of the objects like  'this',  'that' etc., are not felt-at that moment he attains identity with the Lord.  This much of discussion is enough.
 
Without doubt  (verse 7) :  one should not entertain any doubt in this regard.
8.7 Tasmat, therefore; anusmara, think of; mam, Me, in the way prescribed by the scriptures; sarvesu kalesu, at all times; and yudhya, fight, engage your-self in war, which is your own (caste) duty. Asamsayah, there is no doubt in this matter; that arpita-mano-buddhih, by dedicating your mind and intellect; mayi; to Me; esyasi, you-you who have thus dedicated our mind and intellect to Me, Vasudeva-will attain; mam eva, Me alone, as I shall be remembered. [When the Lord instructs Arjuna to think of Him, and at the same time engage in war, it may seem that He envisages a combination of Knowledge and action. But this is not so, because when one thinks of all actions, accessories and results that come within the purview of the mind and the intellect as Brahman, it is denied that actions etc. have any separate reality apart from Brahman. Therefore no combination is involved here.]
Besides,
8.8 With the mind not moving towards any other thing, made steadfast by the method of habitual meditation, and constantly meditating, one goes to the Supreme Person, the Resplendent, O Arjuna.
8.8 He whose mind does not wander, and who is engaged in constant meditation, attains the Supreme Spirit.
8.8. He, who is engaged in the after-reflection (who meditates) on the Supreme Divine Soul with his mind, remaining fixed in the practice-Yoga and [hence] passing over no other object - that person attains [that Supreme], O son of Prtha !
8.8 O son of Prtha, by meditating with a mind which is engaged in the yoga of practice and which does not stray away to anything else, one reaches the supreme Person existing in the effulgent region.

8.8 With the mind not moving towards any other thing, made steadfast by the method of habitual meditation, and constantly meditating, one goes to the Supreme Person, the Resplendent, O Arjuna.

8.8 Partha, O son of Prtha; anu-cintayan, by meditating, i.e. contemplating in accordance with (anu) the instruction of teachers and scriptures; cestasa, with a mind; abhyasa-yogayuktena, engaged in the yoga of practice-abhyasa, practice, consists in the repetition of the same kind of thought, uninterupted by any contrary idea, with regard to Me who am the object of concentration of the mind; that practice itself is yoga; the mind of a yogi is engrossed (yuktam) in that itself; with a mind that is such, and na anya-gamina, which does not stray away to anything else which is not inclined to go away to any other object; yati, one reaches; the paramam, supreme, unsurpassed; purusam, Person; divyam, existing in the effulgent region (divi), in the Solar Orb.
And, to what kind of a Person does he go? This is being stated:
8.8 O son of Prtha, by meditating with a mind which is engaged in the yoga of practice and which does not stray away to anything else, one reaches the supreme Person existing in the effulgent region.
8.8 Contemplating on Me, the Supreme Divine Person, in the way to be specified further, at the last moment, with a mind trained by constant practice and Yoga, and not moving towards anything else, one reaches Me alone, i.e., attains a form similar to that of Mine, by virtue of the attributes of enjoyment and the prosperity contemplated upon, like the royal sage Bharata who acired the form of a deer on account of contemplating on it at the last moment. Abhyasa is the training of the mind to be often in touch with the object of meditation at all times without obstruction to the performance of the prescribed periodical and occasional rituals. Yoga is the meditation practised day by day at the time of Yoga practice in the manner prescribed.
8.8 Abhyasa-etc.,  He, who is engaged in the after-reflection :  he who reflects on the Bhagavat after the pain created by the body has ended following  the break of [his connection with] the body.
8.8 Partha, O son of Prtha; anu-cintayan, by meditating, i.e. contemplating in accordance with (anu) the instruction of teachers and scriptures; cestasa, with a mind; abhyasa-yogayuktena, engaged in the yoga of practice-abhyasa, practice, consists in the repetition of the same kind of thought, uninterupted by any contrary idea, with regard to Me who am the object of concentration of the mind; that practice itself is yoga; the mind of a yogi is engrossed (yuktam) in that itself; with a mind that is such, and na anya-gamina, which does not stray away to anything else which is not inclined to go away to any other object; yati, one reaches; the paramam, supreme, unsurpassed; purusam, Person; divyam, existing in the effulgent region (divi), in the Solar Orb.
And, to what kind of a Person does he go? This is being stated:
8.9 Whosoever meditates on the Omniscient, the Ancient, the Ruler (of the whole world), minuter than an atom, the supporter of all, of inconceivable form, effulgent like the sun and beyond the darkness of ignorance.
8.9 Whoso meditates on the Omniscient, the Ancient, more minute than the atom, yet the Ruler and Upholder of all, Unimaginable, Brilliant like the Sun, Beyond the reach of darkness;
8.9. He, who meditates continuously on the Ancient Seer, the Ruler, the Subtler than the subtle, the Supporter of all, the Unimaginable-formed, the Sun-coloured, and That which is beyond the darkness;
8.9 He who meditates on the Omniscient, the Anceint, the Ruler, subtler than the subtle, the Ordainer of everything, of inconceivable form, effulgent like the sun, and beyond darkness-(he attains the supreme Person).

8.9 Whosoever meditates on the Omniscient, the Ancient, the Ruler (of the whole world), minuter than an atom, the supporter of all, of inconceivable form, effulgent like the sun and beyond the darkness of ignorance.

8.9 Yah, he who, anyone who; anusmaret, meditates on; kavim, the Omniscient, the Knower of things past, present and future; puranam, the Ancient, the Eternal; anusasitaram, the Ruler, the Lord of the whole Universe; aniyamsam, subtler; anoh, than the subtle; dhataram, the Ordainer; sarvasya, of every-thing-one who grants the fruits of actions, in all their varieties, individually to all creatures; acintya-rupam, who is of inconceivable form-His form, though always existing, defies being conceived of by anybody; aditya-varnam, who is effulgent like the sun, who is manifest as eternal Consciousness like the effulgence of the sun; and parastat, beyond; tamasah, darkness-beyond the darkness of delusion in the form of ignorance-(he attains the supreme Person). This verse is to be connected with the earlier itself thus: 'by meditating (on Him)৷৷.he attains Him.'
Further,
8.9 He who meditates on the Omniscient, the Anceint, the Ruler, subtler than the subtle, the Ordainer of everything, of inconceivable form, effulgent like the sun, and beyond darkness-(he attains the supreme Person).
8.9 - 8.10 He who focusses his life-breath between the eyrows at the time of death with a mind rendered unswerving through its purification achieved by the strength of Yoga conjoined with Bhakti practised day after day; and he who contemplates on the 'Kavi' i.e., the Omniscient, the 'Primeval', i.e., who existed always, 'the Ruler,' i.e., who governs the universe, 'who is subtler than the subtle,' i.e., who is subtler than the individual self, 'who is the Dhata' of all, i.e., the creator of all, 'whose nature is inconceivable,' i.e., whose nature is other than everything else, 'who is sun-coloured and beyond darkness,' i.e., who possesses a divine form peculiar to Himself - he who concentrates on Him, the Divine Person described above, between the eyrows, attains Him alone. He attains His state and comes to have power and glory similar to His. Such is the meaning.

Then He describes the mode of meditation to be adopted by the seeker of Kaivalya or the Jijnasu (i.e., of one who seeks to know his own self or Atman in contrast to one whose object is God-realisation).
8.9 See Comment under 8.10
8.9 Yah, he who, anyone who; anusmaret, meditates on; kavim, the Omniscient, the Knower of things past, present and future; puranam, the Ancient, the Eternal; anusasitaram, the Ruler, the Lord of the whole Universe; aniyamsam, subtler; anoh, than the subtle; dhataram, the Ordainer; sarvasya, of every-thing-one who grants the fruits of actions, in all their varieties, individually to all creatures; acintya-rupam, who is of inconceivable form-His form, though always existing, defies being conceived of by anybody; aditya-varnam, who is effulgent like the sun, who is manifest as eternal Consciousness like the effulgence of the sun; and parastat, beyond; tamasah, darkness-beyond the darkness of delusion in the form of ignorance-(he attains the supreme Person). This verse is to be connected with the earlier itself thus: 'by meditating (on Him)৷৷.he attains Him.'
Further,
9.1 The Blessed Lord said  I shall now declare to thee who does not cavil, the greatest secret, the knowledge combined with experience (Self-realisation). Having known this thou shalt be free evil.
9.1 "Lord Shri Krishna said: I will now reveal to thee, since thou doubtest not, that profound mysticism, which when followed by experience, shall liberate thee from sin.
9.1. The Bhagavat said  To you, who is entertaining no displeasure, I shall clearly declare also this most secret knowledge, together with action, by knowing which you shall be free from evil.
9.1 The Lord said  I shall declare to you, who does not cavil, this most mysterious knowledge together with special knowledge, knowing which you would be freed from evil.
9.1 The Blessed Lord said  However, to you who are not given to cavilling I shall speak of this highest secret itself, which is Knowledge [Jnana may mean Brahman that is Consciousness, or Its knowledge gathered from the Vedas (paroksa-jnana). Vijnana is direct experience (aparoksa-jnana).] combined with experience, by realizing which you shall be free from evil.
9.1 The Lord said  I will declare to you, who does not cavil, this most mysterious knowledge called Upasana, which is of the nature of Bhakti, together with special knowledge, namely, the distinguishing knowledge of how it differs from other meditations. The import is this:  You have heard of My eminence, which is distinct in kind from all other forms of greatness and is unlimited in its modes. You must have been convinced that it can be so only and not otherwise. To you whose mind is thus prepared, I shall declare that knowledge by aciring which, and making which your way of life, you will be emancipated from all evil that hinders you from attaining Me.
9.1 Idam etc.  Not to entertain displeasure is an important reisite for communicating knowledge.  The words  Jnana and  Vijnana  [mean respectively  'knowledge' and  'action'] as above.
9.1  Te, to you; anasuyave, who are not given to cavilling, who are free from carping; pravaksyami, I shall speak of; idam, this.
The Lord uttered the word 'this' by bearing in mind as an immediately present fact the knowledge of Brahman that will be and was spoken of in the earlier chapters. The word tu (however) is used for pointing out a distinction [The distinction of Knowledge from meditation that was being discussed.].
(I shall speak) of this itself-what is that?-(it is) guhyatamam, the highest secret; and is jnanam, Knowledge, complete Knowledge-nothing else-, the direct means to Liberation, as stated in the Upanisads and the Smrtis, 'Vasudeva is all' (7.19), 'the Self verily is all this' (Ch. 7.25.2), 'One only, without a second' (op. cit. 6.2.1), etc., and also as stated in such Upanisadic texts as, 'On the other hand, those who understand otherwise than this come under a different ruler, and belong to the worlds that are subject to decay' (op. cit. 7.25.2). (Knowledge) of what kind? It is vijnana-sahitam, combined with experience; jnatva, by realizing, by attaining; yat, which Knowledge; moksyase, you shall be free; asubhat, from evil, from worldly bondage.
9.10 Under Me as supervisor, Nature produces the moving and the unmoving; because of this, O Arjuna, the world revolves.
9.10 Under my guidance, Nature produces all things movable and immovable. Thus it is, O Arjuna, that this universe revolves.
9.10. O son of Kunti !  On account of Me, Who remain (only) as an observer and as prime cause, the nature  [of Mine]  gives birth to [both] the moving and unmoving;  hence this world moves in a circle.
9.10 Under My supervision, Prakrti gives birth to all mobile and immobile entities. Because of this, O Arjuna, does the world revolve.
9.10 Under Me as the supervisor, the Prakrti produces (the world) of the moving and the non-moving things. Owing to this reason, O son of Kunti, the world revolves.
9.10 Therefore, My Prakrti, looked at by Me, through My will and under My supervision creates the world with its mobile and immobile beings in accordance with the Karma of individual selves. Because of this, namely, My look at Prakrti in conformity with the Karma of individual selves, the world revolves. Behold in this wonderful phenomena the lordly power inherent to Me, the son of Vasudeva, such as My sovereignty, true resolve and being devoid of cruelty and similar blemishes! So declare the Srutis:  'The possessor of Maya projects this universe out of this. The other (i.e., individual self) is confined by Maya in the world. One should know the Maya to be the Prakrti. And the possessor of Maya to be the Mighty Lord' (Sve. U., 4.9.10).
9.9-10 Na ca etc.  Maya etc.  There is for Me no bondage of actions, because  I remain unconcerned.  That is why, not resorting to any activity, I am the  pirme cause in the process of world-creation.
9.10 Maya, under Me; adhyaksena, as the supervisor, remaining changeless as a mere witness under all circumstances; prakrtih, the Prakrti, My maya consisting of the three gunas and characterized as ignorance; suyate, produces; the world sa-cara-acaram. of the moving and the none-moving things. Thus there is the Vedic text, 'The one divine Being is hidden in all beings; He is amnipresent, the indwelling Self of all bengs, the Supervisor of actions, the refuge of all beings, the witness, the one who imparts consceiousness, unconditioned [This is according to Sankaracarya's commentary on this verse. A.G. interprets kevala as non-dual.-Tr.] and without alities' (Sv. 6.11).
Anena hetuna, owing to this reason-because of this presiding over; O son of Kunti, the jagat, world, with the moving and the non-moving things, consisting of the manifest and the unmanifest; viparivartate, revolves, under all conditions [During creation, continuance and dissolution.] All the activities of the world in the form, 'I eat this; I see; I hear this; I experience this happiness, suffer this sorrow; I shall do this for that purpose, [Ast. omits this portion.-Tr] I shall do this for this purpose; I shall know this,' etc. indeed arise owing to their being the objects of the conscious witness. They verily exist in consciousness, and end in consciousness. And such mantras as, 'He who is the witness of this is in the supreme heaven' [Supreme heaven, the heart; i.e. He is inscrutable.] (Rg., Na. Su. 10.129.7; Tai. Br.2.8.9), reveal this fact. Since it follows from this that there is no other conscious being part from the one Deity-who is the witness of all as the absolute Consciousness, and who in reality has no contact with any kind of enjoyment-, therefore there is no other enjoyer. Hence, in this context, the estion, 'For what purpose is this creation?', and its answer are baseless-in accordance with the Vedic text, 'Who know (It) truly, who can fully speak about this here? From where has this come? From where is this variegated creation?' (Rg. 3.54.5; 10.129.6). And it has been pointed out by the Lord also: 'Knowledge remains covered by ignorance. Thery the creatures become deluded' (5.15).
9.11 Fools disregard Me, clad in human form, not knowing My higher Being as the great Lord of (all) beings.
9.11 Fools disregard Me, seeing Me clad in human form. They know not that in My higher nature I am the Lord-God of all.
9.11. Being unaware of the immutable highest Absolute Supreme nature of Mine, the deluded ones disregard  Me dwelling in the human body.
9.11 Fools disregard Me, dwelling in a human form, not knowing My higher nature, as the Supreme Lord of all beings.
9.11 Not knowing My supreme nature as the Lord of all beings, foolish people disregard Me who have taken a human body.
9.11 Because of their evil actions (Karmas), fools disregard Me - the great Lord of all beings, the Omniscient, whose resolves are true, who is the sole cause of the entire universe, and who has taken the human body out of great compassion so that I might become the refuge of all. They consider Me to be a man like themselves. The meaning is that they disregard Me, not knowing My higher nature which is an abode of compassion, generosity, condescension and parental solicitude. This nature of mine is the cause of My resorting to the human shape. But without understanding this, the ignorant consider Me as of the same nature as others, because I have assumed the human form.
9.11 Avajananti etc.  I am reclining within all that is born Being the Self of all,  I become the object of disrespect.  For,  [they raise the estion] :  'Apart from the fourteen types of creation, like man etc., no Lord is found; hence how can He exist ?'
9.11 Ajanatah, not knowing; mama, My; param, supreme; bhavam, nature-My supreme Reality, which is like space, nay, which is subtler and more pervasive than space; as bhuta-maheswaram, the Lord of all beings, the great Lord of all beings who is their Self; mudhah, foolish people, the non-discriminating ones; avajananti, disregard, belittle; mam, Me, although I am by nature thus eternal, pure, intelligent, free and the Self of all beings; and asritam, who have taken; manusim tanum, a human body common to men, i.e৷৷. when I act with the help of a human body. As a result of that, as a result of continously disrespecting Me, those wretches get ruined.
How?
9.12 Of vain hopes, of vain actions, of vain knowledge and senseless, they verily are possessed of the deceitful nature of demons and undivine beings.
9.12 Their hopes are vain, their actions worthless, their knowledge futile; they are without sense, deceitful, barbarous and godless.
9.12. [They]  are of futile aspirations, futile actions, futile knowledge and wrong intellect; and they take recourse only to the delusive nature that is demoniac and also devilish.
9.12 Senseless men entertain a nature which is deluding and akin to that of Raksasas (fiends) and Asuras (monsters). Their hopes are vain, acts are vain and knowledge is vain.
9.12 Of vain hopes, of vain actions, of vain knowledge, and senseless, they become verily possessed of the deceptive disposition of fiends and demons.
9.12 Men yielding to the deluding nature characteristics of Asuras and Raksas and not aware of My higher nature like compassion etc. When I am in a human form, are possessed of vain hopes, i.e, their hopes remain fruitless, and their knowledge also is vain, i.e., is fruitless. They are so because of their erroneous understanding which fails to know that all things, mobile and immobile, belong to Me. They are ignorant on account of their being devoid of knowledge of truth everywhere. Whatever they do regarding Me, the Lord of all, is done with an attitude that I am an ordinary mortal. So their efforts go in vain. All this springs from their partaking of the nature of Raksasas and Asuras.
9.12 Mogha-etc.  Their action, knowledge and aspirations are all futile, as these are concerned with the unreal.  The demoniac and devilish nature etc.  They are of the nature of excessive desire and ignorance.
9.12 Moghasah, of vain hopes. So also, mogha-karmanah, of vain actions: their rites, such as Agnihotra etc. which are undertaken by them, verily become vain, fruitless actions, because of dishonouring the Lord, disregarding Him who is their own Self. In this way they are of vain actions.
Similarly, mogha-jnanah, of vain knowledge: of fruitless knowledge; even their knowledge verily becomes useless. And vicetasah, senseless: i.e., they lose their power of discrimination. Besides, [Besides, in the next birth৷৷.] they become sritah, possessed of; the mohinim, self-deceptive, self-delusive; prakritim, disposition; raksasim, of fiends; and asurim, of demons-according to which the body is the Self; i.e., they become habitually inclined to act cruelly, saying, 'cut, break, drink, eat, steal others' wealth,' etc. [The habit to cut, break, drink, eat, etc. is characteristic of fiends. The habit of stealing others' wealth, etc. is characteristic of demons.] This is stated in the Sruti, 'Those worlds of devils (are covered by blinding darkness)' (Is. 3).
9.13 But the great souls, O Arjuna, partaking of My divine nature, worship Me with a single mind (with the mind devoted to nothing else), knowing Me as the imperishable source of beings.
9.13 But the Great Souls, O Arjuna! Filled with My Divine Spirit, they worship Me, they fix their minds on Me and on Me alone, for they know that I am the imperishable Source of being.
9.13. O son of Prtha !  The great-souledmen, however, taking hold of the divine nature and having nothing else in their mind, adore Me by viewing Me as the imperishable prime cuase of beings.
9.13 But the great-souled ones, O Arjuna, who are associated with My divine nature, worship Me with unwavering mind, knowing Me to be the immutable source of beings.
9.13 O son of Prtha, the noble ones, being possessed of divine nature, surely adore Me with single-mindedness, knowing Me as the immutable source of all objects.
9.13 Those who, through their multitude of good acts, have taken refuge in Me and have been thery released from the bondage of evil - they understand My divine nature. They are high-souled. Knowing Me to be the immutable source of all beings, namely, as the Lord whose name, acts and nature are beyond thought and speech, and who has descended in a human form out of supreme compassion to rescue the good, - they worship Me with un unswerving mind. As I am extremely dear to them, without worshipping Me they are unable to find support for their mind, self and external organs. Thus they become devoted to Me as their sole object.
9.13 See Comment under 9.15
9.13 On the other hand, O son of Prtha, those mahat-manah, noble ones-who are not small-mined, who are imbued with faith, and who have set out on the path of Liberation, which is characerized by devotion to God; being asritah, possessed of; daivim, divine; prakrtim, nature-distinguished by mental and physical control, kindness, faith, etc.; tu, surely; bhajante, adore; mam, Me, God; ananya-manasah, with single-mindedness; jnatva, knowing Me; as the avyayam, immutable; bhutadim, source of all objects, of space etc. (i.e. th five elements) as well as of living beings.
How?
9.14 Always glorifying Me, striving,firm in vows, prostrating themselves before Me, they worship Me with devotion always steadfast.
9.14 Always extolling Me, strenuous, firm in their vows, prostrating themselves before Me, they worship Me continually with concentrated devotion.
9.14. Ever speaking of My glory, striving with firm resolve,  paying homage to Me and being permanently endowed with devotion they worship Me.
9.14 Aspiring for eternal communion with Me, they worship Me, always singing My praises, striving with steadfast resolution and bowing down to Me in devotion.
9.14 Always glorifying Me and striving, the men of firm vows worship Me by paying obeisance to Me and being ever endowed with devotion.
9.14 Because of My being very dear to them, they are unable to find support for their souls even for a moment without 'singing My praises,' 'striving for My sake and bowing to Me in reverence.' Remembering My names connotative of My special attributes, they cry out My names - Narayana, Krsna, Vasudeva etc., with horripilations in every part of their bodies and with their voices tremulous and indistinct because of joy. They engage in activities for my sake, such as performing worship, and doing actions helpful to worship, lik building temples and cultivating temple gardens. They prostrate themselves on the earth like a stick, indifferent to dust, mud and the gravel, with all the eight members of their beings - the Manas, Buddhi, Ahankara, the two feet, two hands, and the head, which are bowed down under the influence of Bhakti. Aspiring for eternal communion with Me, desiring eternal union with Me, they worship Me, resolved to attain the state of servitude to Me for their entire being.
9.14 See Comment under 9.15
9.14 Satatam, always; kirtayantah, glorifying; mam, Me, God, who am Brahman in reaility; ca, and; yatantah, striving, endeavouring with the help of such virtues as withdrawal of the organs, control of mind and body, kindness, non-injury, etc.; drdha-vratah, the men of firm vows those whose vows [Vows such as celibacy], those whosevows are unshakable; upasate, worship Me; namasyantah, by paying obeisance; mam, to Me, to the Self residing in the heart, ca, and; nitya-yuktah, being ever endowed; bhaktya, with devotion.
The various ways in which they adore are being stated:
9.15 Others also sacrificing with the wisdom-sacrifice worship Me, the All-faced, as one, as distinct, and as manifold.
9.15 Others worship Me with full consciousness as the One, the Manifold, the Omnipresent, the Universal.
9.15. [Of them]  some worship Me by knowledge-sacrifice and others by offering sacrifices; [thus] they worship Me, the Universally-faced [either] as One [or] as  Many.
9.15 Others, too, besides offering the sacrifice of knowledge, worship Me as One, who, characterised by diversity in numberless ways, is multiformed (in My Cosmic aspect).
9.15 Others verily worship Me by adoring exclusively through the sacrifice of the knowledge of oneness; (others worship Me) multifariously, and (others) as the multiformed existing variously.
9.15 Other high-minded persons worship Me by singing My names, etc., already described; and they also perform the sacrifice called knowledge. They worship Me, who, by being 'characterised by diversity in various ways' in the form of the cosmos, is a multiform, namely, having all entities as modes (Prakaras) and also as One (the Prakari). The purport is this:  The Lord Vasudeva alone, having the body comprising animate and inanimate entities in an extremely subtle form (in the state of Cosmic dissolution) incapable of distinctness by name and form, resolves by His unfailing true will power:  'May I become embodied in gross animate and inanimate entities, distinguished variously by name and form.' He alone then abides, with the variegated cosmos as His body, comprising gods, animals, men and immobile things. They worship Me by contemplating on Me thus.

Therefore Sri Krsna declares:  'I, having the universe for My body, alone abide'.
9.13-15 Mahatmanah etc., upto Visvato-mukham.  Divine nature i.e., of goodness.  Offering sacrifices : i.e., by means of sacrifices with the external materials.  But others worship Me with knowledge-sacrifice only.  Hence through knowledge some [worship Me]  as One, while others [worship Me] as Many through the action-Yoga.  However all conceive Me alone, as their highest goal.	
 But, action certainly abounds in the idea of duality, because it is coextensive with hosts of  different causes  (karakas).   So how can it lead to the Absolute state ?  It is answered  [as] :
9.15 Anye, others, giving up others forms of adoration; ca, verily; upasate, worship; mam, Me, God; yajantah, by adoring, glorifying; api, exclusively; jnana-yajnene ekatvena, through the sacrifice of the knowledge of oneness-knowledge of God itself being the sacrifice; and that knowledge consists in the realization of the highest truth that the supreme Brahman is verily one. Adoring with that (knowledge) they worship Me.
And some others Me prthaktvena, multifariously-in different forms as the sun, moon, etc. They worship (Me) by thinking that, Visnu who is God Himself exists in different forms as the sun etc.
Still others worship Me thinking that, that very God who is visvatomukhah, mulitiformed, who has His facr everywhere, i.e., who is the Cosmic Person; exists bahudha, variously. In numerous ways they worship Him, the Cosmic Person, who has His face everywhere.
'If they worship in numerous ways, how is it that they worship You alone?' Hence the Lord says:
9.16 I am the Kratu; I am the Yajna; I am the offering (food) to the manes; I am the medicinal herbs and all the plants; I am the Mantra; I am also the Ghee or the melted butter; I am the fire; I am the oblation.
9.16 I am the Oblation, the Sacrifice and the Worship; I am the Fuel and the Chant, I am the Butter offered to the fire, I am the Fire itself, and I am the Act of offering.
9.16. I am determination; I am sacrifice;  I am Svadha;  I am the juice of the herb;  I am the (Vedic)  hymn; I am alone the clarified butter also;  I am the [sacrificial]  fire;  (and)  I am the act of offering.
9.16 I am the Kratu. I am the sacrifice. I am the offering to the manes. I am the herb. I am the Mantra. I am Myself the clarified butter. I am the fire. I am the oblation.
9.16 I am the kratu, I am the yajna, I am the svadha, I am the ausadha, I am the mantra, I Myself am the ajya, I am the fire, and I am the act of offering.
9.16 I am the Kratu, namely, I am Jyotistoma and other Vedic sacrifices. I alone am the Great Sacrifice (the fivefold sacrifices). I am the Svadha, the libation offered to nourish the hosts of manes. I am the herb, namely, oblation. I am the Mantra. I alone am the clarified butter. This implies other illustrations also. I alone am the oblation of Soma etc. Such is the meaning. I am the fire such as Ahavaniya etc. I am the act of offering into fire.
9.16 See Comment under 9.19
9.16 Aham, I; am the kratuh, a kind of Vedic sacrifice; I Myself am the yajnah, sacrifice as prescribed by the Smrtis; further, I am svadha, the food that is offered to the manes; I am ausadham-by which word is meant the food that is eaten by all creatures. Or, svadha means food in general of all creatures, and ausadha means medicine for curing diseases. I am the mantra with which offering is made to manes and gods. I Myself am the ajyam, oblations; and I am agnih, the fire-I Myself am the fire into which the oblation is poured. And I am the hutam, act of offering.
Besides,
9.17 I am the father of this world, the mother, the dispenser of the fruits of actions and the 
grandfather; the (one) thing to be known, the purifier, the sacred monosyllable (Om), and also the Rik-, the Sama-and the Yajur-Vedas.
9.17 I am the Father of the universe and its Mother; I am its Nourisher and its Grandfather; I am the Knowable and the Pure; I am Om; and I am the Sacred Scriptures.
9.17. I am the father,  the mother,  the sustainer and the paternal-grandsire of this world; [I am] the sacred object of knowledge, the syullable Om, the Rk, the Saman,  and the Yajus too.
9.17 I am the father, mother, creator and grandfather of the universe. I am the purifier. I am the syllable Om and also Rk, Saman and the Yajus.
9.17 Of this world I am the father, mother, ordainer, (and the), grand-father; I am the knowable, the sancitifier, the syllable Om as also Rk, Sama and Yajus.
9.17 Of the world consisting of mobile and immobile entities, I alone am the father, mother, creator and grandfather. Here the term Dhatr stands for one other than the parents who helps in the birth of a particular person. Whatever is known from theVedas as purifying, I alone am that. I am the Pranava, which originates knowledge and forms the seed of the Vedas. I am the Veda comprising Rk, Saman and Yajus.
9.17 See Comment under 9.19
9.17 Asya, of this; jagatah, world; aham, I; am pita, the father; mata, the mother; dhata, ordainer, dispenser of the results of their actions to the creatures; (and the) pirtamahah, grand-father. I am the vedayam, knowable-that which has to be known; the pavitram, sanctifier; [Virtuous actions.] and the onkarah, syllable Om; eva ca, as also Rk, Sama and Yajus. [Brahman, which has to be known, is realizable through Om, regarding which fact the three Vedas are the authority. The ca (as also) is suggestive of the Atharva-veda.]
Moreover,
9.18 I am the goal, the supporter, the Lord, the witness, the abode, the shelter, the friend, the origin, the dissolution, the foundation, the treasure-house and the seed which is imperishable.
9.18 I am the Goal, the Sustainer, the Lord, the Witness, the Home, the Shelter, the Lover and the Origin; I am Life and Death; I am the Fountain and the Seed Imperishable.
9.18. [I am] the method, the nourisher, the lord, the witness, the abode, the refuge, the good-hearted (friend), the origin, the dissolution, the sustenance, the repository and the imperishable seed  [of the world].
9.18 I am the goal, supporter, the Lord, the witness, the abode, the refuge and the friend. I am the seat of origin and dissolution, the base for preservation and the imperishable seed.
9.18 (I am) the fruit of actions, the nourisher, the Lord, witness, abode, refuge, friend, origin, end, foundation, store and the imperishable seed.
9.18 'Gaith' means that which is reached. The meaning is that it is the place to be reached from everywhere. The 'supporter' is one who props. The 'ruler' is one who rules. The 'witness' is one who sees directly. The 'abode' is that where one dwells in as in a house etc. The 'refuge' is the intelligent being wh has to be sought, as he leads one to the attainment of desirable things and avoidance of evils. A 'friend' is one who wishes well. The 'base' is that place in which origin and dissolution takes place. I alone am that 'Nidhana', that which is preserved. What comes into being and is dissolved is Myself. The imperishable seed is that exhaustless cause everywhere. I alone am that.
9.18 See Comment under 9.19
9.18 (I am) the gatih, fruit of actions; the bharta, nourisher; [The giver of the fruits of actions.] the prabhuh, Lord; the saksi, witness of all tha is done or not done by creatures; the nivasah, abode, where creatures live; the saranam, refuge, remover of sufferings of the afflicted who take shelter; the suhrt, friend, one who does a good turn without thought of reward; the prabhavah, origin of the world; the pralayah, end, the place into which the world merges. So also, (I am) the sthanam, foundation on which the world rests; the nidhanam, store, which is for future enjoyment of creatures; and the avyayam, imperishable; bijam, seed, the cause of growth of all things which germinate. The seed is imperishable because it continues so long as the world lasts. Indeed, nothing springs up without a seed. And since creation is noticed to be continuous, it is understood that the continuity of the seed never ends.
Further,
9.19 (As the sun) I give heat; I withhold and send forth the rain; I am immortality and also death, existence and non-existence, O Arjuna.
9.19 I am the Heat of the Sun, I release and hold back the Rains. I am Death and Immortality; I am Being and Not-Being.
9.19. I give heat;  I hold back and also end forth rains;  I am immortality and also death,  the real and also the unreal,  O Arjuna !
9.19 I give heat. I hold back and send forth the rain. I am immortality as well as death, O Arjuna. I am the being, as also the non-being.
9.19 O Arjuna, I give heat, I withhold and pour down rain. I am verily the nectar, and also death existence and nonexistence.
9.19 I send out 'heat' in the form of fire, the sun etc. I 'hold back' the rain during summer. Likewise, I pour out the rains during the rainy season. I am 'immortality as well as death' - I am both these conditions through which the world lives and dies. Why say more?  I am 'the being and the non-being.' Being is that which exists in the present time. Non-being is that which existed in the past and that which may exist in the future, but is not experienced now as existing. The meaning is that, I alone am existent, having all the entities for my modes, as all intelligent and inhert beings existing in all states, constitute My body. In this way, they (the wise) worship Me, contemplating, through the realisation of My essential unity, as the entire universe distinguished by names and forms and characterished by varied pluralities constituting My body. I alone exist; all the pluralities are only My modes.

Thus, after depiciting the character of the noble-minded, whose enjoyment consists of only the experience of the Lord, and in order to bring into bolder relief their greatness, He describes the behaviour of ignorant men who covet the objects of desire.
9.16-19 Ahim kratuh etc. upto Arjuna.  The Brahman-being is of course only one and admits of no parts.  The action also depends only on the assumed  [or not real]  causes.  Hence, it accomplishes the aloneness (or oneness) of the Brahman.  For, if it is performed with the realisation that all the different causes are nothing but the Self, then the action is not far away from reaching the Bhagavat.  That has also been stated -
 
'This  self same action-power of Siva,  if it exists in the ignorant, binds  [him]; the same power, when it is realised that it is a path to his own Self  [Siva], then it leads to the goal (the Lord).'  (SpK, III, 16).
 
I have myself  (Ag.) stated elsewhere as :
 
The intellect that confirms, in the beginning, to  [the duality of]  the beings and the non-beings; the same intellect does not conform, at the time of withdrawl, to [the duality of] the beings and the non-beings.
 
This subject has been discussed in detail in different places.  Hence let us stop [the present discussion] here.
 
I give heat etc.  This is said in the context of  discussing the One that  admits no duality.									
 But if the Brahman can be attained by means of external sacrifices also, then, is a different god (different from Vasudeva)  worshipped in the sacrifices like the Agnistoma ?  If it is admitted, then it would lead to the doctrine of  duality.  If [on the other hand] it is Vasudeva Himself, the how is it that emancipation is not attained by the performence [of these sacrifices] ?  Therefore it is stated -
9.19 O Arjuna, aham, I, in the form of the sun; tapami, give heat through some intense rays. Through some rays utsrjami, I pour down; varsam, rain. Having poured down, again nigrhnami, I withdraw it through some rays-for eight months. Again I pour it down in the rainy season. I am eva ca, verily; the amrtam, nectar of the gods; and mrtyuh, death of the mortals. I Myself am sat, existence-the effect which has come into bneing in relation to its cause; and its opposite, asat, nonexistence. [Nonexistence: the cause which has not become manifest as the effect possessing name and form, It cannot be admitted that the effect has absolute existence, for the Upanisad says, 'All transformation has speech as it basis, and it is name only' (Ch.6. 1. 4). Nor can it be said that the cause has absolute non-existence, for there is the text,'৷৷.by what logic can the existent come verily out of nonexistence? But surely,৷৷.all this was Existence, one without a second' (op. cit. 6.2.2).] It is not that the Lord is Himself absolutely nonexistence; nor are effect and cause (absolutely) existence and nonexistent (respectively).
Those men of Knowledge who meditate of Me while worshpping Me according to the respective forms of sacrifices mentioned above-regardomg Me as one or multifirious, etc.-, they attain Me alone according to their conceptions.
9.2 This is the kingl science, the kingly secret, the supreme purifier, realisable by direct intuitional knowledge, according to righteousness, very easy to perform and imperishable.
9.2 This is the Premier Science, the Sovereign Secret, the Purest and Best; intuitional, righteous; and to him who practiseth it pleasant beyond measure.
9.2. This shines among the sciences;  (this is) the secret of monarchs; it is a supreme purifier, it is comprehensible by immediate perception, is righteous, easy to do, and imperishable.
9.2 This is the royal science, royal mystery, the supreme purifier, It is realised by direct experience. It is in accord with Dharma, it is pleasant to practise and is abiding.
9.2 This is the Sovereign Knowledge, the Sovereign Profundity, the best sanctifire; directly realizable, righteous, very easy to practise and imperishable.
9.2 This is a 'royal science', the king among sciences; 'the royal mystery', the king among mysteries. Or royal science may also mean the science known and practised by kings. Indeed kings are those who have broad and profound minds. The meaning is that this is the science of great minds. This is a mystery, because the great-minded alone are skilled in keeping mysteries. This is 'supreme purifier'; for it removes completely all blemishes opposed to the attainment of Myself.

It is realised by 'direct perception'. Avagama' is that which is apprehended - the subject of knowledge. It is that knowledge which has become direct perception, so that its object is directly apprehended. The import is that I, when worshipped in the spirit of Bhakti, become perceptible to the worshipper immediately.

Even so, it is in 'accord with Dharma' or inseparable from Dharma. What is called Dharma is that which constitutes the means for the highest good. Though it is of the nature of supreme good, as it brings about the vision of Myself, yet it is also the means for completely attaining Me, which is the end unsurpassed and the final good.

Because of this, it is 'pleasurable' to practise; its adoption is a matter of supreme love. It is 'abiding', imperishable. It does not perish even after leading to My attainment. That is, I give Myself up to one who performs this form of worship; even then it appears to Me that I have done nothing for him. Such is the meaning.
9.2 Raja-etc.  Shines :  that which illumines in the midst of all sciences.  Here [in the Gita]  itself it is said 'The science of the Self  [is the chief] among the sciences'.  Here in this science kings like  Janaka etc., have a right and pervilege  (adhikara)  [to learn].  It is their secret, as it is much protected  (by them)  by heroism easy for the  Ksatriyas.  As they do not waver [in their mind]  because of their heroic nature that is common in the members of the warring class, it is very easy to do i.e.,  to observe.  Imperishable :  Unlike other actions this action of worshipping  Brahman does not perish through the enjoyment of  [its result].
9.2 And that is raja-vidya, the Sovereign Knowledge, the kind among sciences because of the abundance of its radiance. Indeed, this knowledge of Brahman shines most brilliantly among all kiinds of learning [The word raja means a king, or figuratively, the greatest; or, derived from the root raj, to shine, it may mean shining.-Tr.] So also, idam, this; is raja-guhyam, the Sovereign Profundity, the kind among profundities; uttamam, the best; pavitram, sanctifier. This knowledge of Brahman, which sanctifies all things that purify, is the greatest. Shine it reduces to ashes in a moment (the results of) all actions-righteous, unrighteous and others-together with their roots, accumulated over many thousands of births, therefore, what to speak of its sanctifying power! Besides, it is pratyaksavagamam, directly realizable, directly perceivable like happiness etc.
Even though possessed of many alities, a thing may be noticed to be contrary to righteousness. The knowledge of the Self is not opposed to righteousness, in that way, but it is dharmyam, righteous, not divorced from righteousness. Eeve so, it may be difficult to practice. Hence the Lord says it is susukham, very easy; kartum to practise, like the knowledge of the distinction among jewels. It is seen (in the world) that, actions which reire little effort and are accomplished easily yield meagre results, whereas those that are difficult to accomplish yield great results. Thus the contingency arises that this (knowledge of Brahman), however. which is easily attained, perishes when its result gets exhausted. Therefore the Lord says it is avyayam, imperishable. From the point of view of its result, it is not perishable like (the results of) actions. Hence the knowledge of the Self should be highly regarded.
9.20 The knowers of the three Vedas, the drinkers of Soma, purified of all sins, worshipping Me by sacrifices, pray for the way to heaven; they reach the holy world of the Lord of the gods and enjoy in heavn the divine pleasures of the gods.
9.20 Those who are versed in the scriptures, who drink the mystic Soma-juice and are purified from sin, but who while worshipping Me with sacrifices pray that I will lead them to heaven; they reach the holy world where lives the Controller of the Powers of Nature, and they enjoy the feasts of Paradise.
9.20. The masters of the three Vedas,  the Somadrinkers, purified of their sins, aspire for the heavengoal by offering sacrifices to Me.  They attain the meritorious world of the lord of gods and taste in the heaven the heavenly pleasures of the gods.
9.20 Those who are versed in the three Vedas, being purified from sin by drinking the Soma juice, pray for the passage to heaven and worship Me by sacrifices. Reaching the holy realm of the chief of the gods, they enjoy in heaven celestial pleasures of the gods.
9.20 Those who are versed in the Vedas, who are drinkers of Soma and are purified of sin, pray for the heavenly goal by worshipping Me through sacrifices. Having reached the place (world) of the king of gods, which is the result of righteousness, they enjoy in heaven th divine pleasure of gods.
9.20 The three Vedas consist of the Rk, Yajus and Saman. The followers of the three Vedas are called 'Trai-vidyah', but they are not devoted to Vedanta (or Trayyanta). The great souls, who rely on Vedanta, know Me, as mentioned before, to be the only object to be known from all the Vedas. Considering Me as the highest object of attainment, they worship Me through singing My names etc., caused by deep devotion to Me, and also through the sacrifice of knowledge.

But the followers of the three Vedas drink the Soma beverage, forming the remainder of sacrifices in honour of Indra and other divinities, as prescribed by the Vedas. They are thery purified of evil that stand in the way of attainment of heaven. In these sacrifices, in which Indra etc., are regarded as divinties, they really worship Me in the forms of these divinities. They 'however' do not know that I abide in them in that way, and so they pray for the way to heaven etc. After attaining the world of Indra, which is free from unhappiness, they enjoy everywhere the divine pleasures.
9.20 See Comment under 9.21
9.20 Those, again, who are ignorant and desirous of pleasures, trai-vidyah, who are versed in the three Vedas, who know the Rk, Yajus and Sama Vedas; somapah, who are drinkers of Soma; and who, as a result of that very drinking of Soma, are puta-papah, purified of sin; prarthayante, pray for; the svargatim, heavenly goal, the attainment of heaven-heaven itself being the goal [Ast. adds this portion-svareva gatih, heaven itself being the goal.-Tr.]-; istva, by worshipping; mam, Me, existing in the forms of gods such as the Vasus and others; yajnaih, through sacrifices such as the Agnistoma etc. And asadya, having reached; surendra-lokam, the place (world) of the kind of gods, of Indra; (which is) punyam, the result of righteousness; te, they; asnanti, enjoy; divi, in heaven; the devyan, divine, heavenly, supernatural;; deva-bhogan, pleasures of gods.
9.21 They, having enjoyed the vast heaven, enter the world of mortals when their merit is exhausted; thus abiding by the injunctions of the ï1threeï1 (Vedas) and desiring (objects of) desires, they attain to the state of going and returning.
9.21 Yet although they enjoy the spacious glories of Paradise, nevertheless, when their merit is exhausted, they are born again into this world of mortals. They have followed the letter of the scriptures, yet because they have sought but to fulfill their own desires, they must depart and return again and again.
9.21. Having enjoyed that vast world of heaven, they, when their merit is exhausted, enter the world of the mortals.  Thus the persons, who long for pleasure and continuously take refuge in the code of conduct prescribed by the Three Vedas, attain the state of going and coming.
9.21 Having enjoyed the spacious world of heaven, they return to the world of mortals their merit is exhausted. Thus, those who follow the Vedic rituals and are drawn by desires, come and go.
9.21 After having enjoyed that vast heavenly world, they enter into the human world on the exhaustion of their merit. Thus, those who follow the rites and duties prescribed in the three Vedas, and are desirous of pleasures, attain the state of going and returning.
9.21 After enjoying the spacious world of heaven, they return to the world of mortals when the meritorious Karma forming the cause of that experience is exhausted. Thus, lacking in the knowledge established in the Vedanta and desiring only the attainment of heaven etc., they who follow the teaching of the three Vedas on sacrificial rites, come and go. After enjoying the trifling and transient pleasures of heaven, they return to Samsara again and again.

But the great souls meditating on Me, who am incomparably dear to them, attain boundless and unsurpassed bliss and do not return to Samsara.

Sri Krsna desribes their distinguishing features:
9.20-21 Traividyah etc.  Te tam etc. Of course, they worship Me (Vasudeva) alone.  However, the action [like sacrifice] is limited (or is known  [to them]) by their aspiration for heaven only.  Hence, on account of the weakness is their own being  (sattva), they  condition the action solely by the result of the heaven.  That is why their  religious act leads to rirth and thus they attain the state of going and coming.  But [on that account] it is not the inherent nature of the sacrifice to beget rirth.										
 For instance :
9.21 Bhuktva, after having enjoyed; tam, that: visalam, vast; svargalokam, heavenly world; te, they; visanti, enter into; this martyalokam, human world; ksine, on the exhaustion; of their punye, merit. Evam, thus, indeed; anuprapannah, those who follow in the manner described; trai-dharmyam, [A variant reading is trayi-dharmam.-Tr.] the rites and duties prescribed in the three Vedas-merely the Vedic rites and duties; and are kama-kamah, desirous of pleasures; labhante, attain; only gata-agatam, the state of going and returning, but never that of independence. This is the meaning.
9.22 For those men who worship Me alone, thinking of no other, for those ever-united, I secure what is not already possessed and preserve what they already possess.
9.22 But if a man will meditate on Me and Me alone, and will worship Me always and everywhere, I will take upon Myself the fulfillment of his aspiration, and I will safeguard whatsoever he shall attain.
9.22. Those men who, having nothing else [as their goal] worship Me  everywhere and are thinking of Me [alone]; to them, who are constantly and fully attached [to Me],  I bear acisition and the security of acisition.
9.22 There are those who, excluding all else, think of Me and worship Me, aspiring after eternal union with Me. Their prosperity and welfare (Yoga and Ksema) are looked after by Me.
9.22 Those persons who, becoming non-different from Me and meditative, worship Me everywhere, for them, who are ever attached (to Me), I arrange for securing what they lack and preserving what they have.
9.22 There are Mahatmas who, excluding everything else and having no other purpose, meditate on Me as their only purpose, because without Me they are unable to sustain themselves. They think of Me and worship Me with all my auspicious attributes and with all my glories. In the case of such devotees aspiring after eternal union with Me, I Myself undertake the responsibility of bringing them to Myself (Yoga translated as 'prosperity') and of preserving them in that state for ever (Ksema translated as 'welfare'). The meaning is that they do not return to Samsara.
9.22 Ananyah etc. [See for example] those who are different  [from the above mentioned]  and who think of  Me.  How [do they think] ?  They have nothing else :  They have no other fruit apart from Me to desire for.  Acisition :  gaining (realising)  My nature not gained (realised) earlier.  Security of acisition :  protection of the already achieved gain of being well established in the nature of the Bhagavat.  On account of this there may not be even a doubt regarding the fall from the Yoga.  This is the idea here.
9.22 On the other hand, ye janah, those persons, the monks, who are desireless and fully illumined; who ananyah, becoming non-different (from Me), having realized the supreme Deity, Narayana, as their own Self; and cintayantah, becoming meditative; ['Having known that I, Vasudeva, am the Self of all, and there is nothing else besides Me'.] paryu-pasate mam, worship Me everywhere; ['They see Me the one, all-pervading, infinite Reality.'] tesam, for them; who have realized the supreme Truth, nitya-abhiyuktanam, who are ever attached (to Me); aham, I; vahami, arrange for; both yoga-kesamam, securing what they lack and preserving what they have. Yoga means making available what one does not have, and ksema means the protection of what one has got.
Since 'but the man of Knowledge is the very Self. (This is) My opinion' and 'he too is dear to Me' (7.17,18), therefore they have become My own Self as also dear. Does not the Lord surely arrange for securing what they lack and protecting what they have even in the case of other devotees? This is true. He does arrange for it. But the difference lies in this: Others who are devotees make their own efforts as well for their own sake, to arrange for securing what they lack and protecting what they have. On the contrary, those who have realized non-duality do not make any effrot to arrange for themselves the acisition of what they do not have and the preservation of what they have. Indeed, they desire nothing for themselves, in life or in death. They have taken refuge only in the Lord. Therefore the Lord Himself arranges to procure what they do not have and protect what they have got.
'If you Yourself are the other gods even, then do not their devotees too worship You alone?' 'Quite so!'
9.23 Even those devotees who, endowed with faith, worship other gods, worship Me alone, O Arjuna, b the wrong method.
9.23 Even those who worship the lesser Powers, if they do so with faith, they thereby worship Me, though not in the right way.
9.23. O son of Kunti !  Even those who are the devotees of other gods and worship [them]  with faith, worship Me alone,  [but] following non-injunction;
9.23 Even those who are devoted to other divinities with faith in their hearts, worship Me alone, O Arjuna, though not as sanctioned by the Sastras.
9.23 Even those who, being devoted to other deities and endowed with faith, worship (them), they also, O son of Kunti, worship Me alone (though) following the wrong method.
9.23 Those, however, who are devoted to Indra and other divinities, who rely on the three Vedas alone, and who, possessed of faith, worship Indra and other divinities - they too worship Me actually in the light of the truth that all existing things constitute My body and have Me for their selves. In the light of this principle, terms like Indra denote Me only. The worshippers of Indra and other deities therefore worship Me only, in ways not sanctioned by the Sastras. They do not worship Indra and other divinities with a proper understanding of the place of these deities in the light of the Vedanta texts. An example is 'Wherein (i.e., in the Supreme Self) the sacrifices known as the Caturhotri attain their fulfilment through the divinities' (Tai. Ar., 4) etc. These texts say in what way these forms of worship apply to these divinties. For all Vedanta texts lay down that the Supreme Person alone is to be worshipped directly when they enjoin the worship of Indra and other divinities, as they form the body of the Supreme Person. The meaning is that in the Caturhotri sacrifice like Agnihotra, the full moon and the new moon sacrifices etc., it is the Supreme Self only that is worshipped, as He abides as the self in Indra etc., who are the ostensible objects worshipped in these sacrifices by which these worshippers obtain their fulfilment through them.

Therefore, the votaries of the three Vedas do not understand that these rituals form the worship of the Supreme Person and that He alone is to be worshipped. As they do not do so, they become experiencers of limited results, and they are again liable to fall into Samsara. Sri Krsna gives expressions to this:
9.23 See Comment under 9.26
9.23 Api, even; ye, those who; anya-devata-bhaktah, being devoted to tother deities; and anvitah sraddhaya, endowed with faith; yajante, worship (them), te api, they also; O son of Kunti, yajanti, worship; mam, Me; eva, alone; (though) avidhi-purvakam, following the wrong method. Avidhi implies ignorance. So the idea is that they worship (Me) ignorantly.
 
'How it is that they worship (Me) ignorantly?' [i.e. the worshippers of other deities worship them knowingly, and hence, how can the estion of their ignorance arise?] This is being answered: Because-
9.24 (For) I alone am the enjoyer and also the Lord of all sacrifices; but they do not know Me in essence (in reality), and hence they fall (return to this mortal world).
9.24 I am the willing recipient of sacrifice, and I am its true Lord. But these do not know me in truth, and so they sink back.
9.24. Because, I am the enjoyer as well as the lord of all sacrifices.  But they do not recognise Me correctly and hence they move away [from Me].
9.24 For, I am the only enjoyer and the only Lord of all sacrifices. They do not recognise Me in My true nature; hence they fall.
9.24 I indeed am the enjoyer as also the Lord of all sacrifices; but they do not know Me in reality. Therefore they fall.
9.24 I am 'the only Lord' - the meaning is that I alone am the bestower of rewards everywhere.

How wonderful is this, that though devoting themselves to the same kind of action, on account of the difference in intention some partake of a very small reward with the likelihood of fall, while some others partake of a reward in the form of attainment of the Supreme Person which is unalloyed, limitless, and incomparable!

Sri Krsna explains this:
9.24 See Comment under 9.26
9.24 As the Self of the deities (of the sacrifices), aham, I; hi, indeed; am the bhokta, enjoyer; ca eva, as also; the prabhuh, Lord; [The Lord: 'I being the indwelling Ruler of all.'] sarva-yajnanam, of all sacrifices enjoined by the Vedas and the Smrtis. A sacrifice is verily presided over by Me, for it has been said earlier, 'I Myself am the entity (called Visnu) that exists in the sacrifice in this body' (8.4). Tu, but; na abhi-jananti, they do not know; mam, Me as such; tattvena, in reality. And atah, therefore, by worshipping ignorantly; te, they; cyavanti, fall from the result of the sacrifice. ['Although they perform sacrifices with great diligence, still just because they do not know Me real nature and do not offer the fruits of their sacrifices to Me, they proceed to the worlds of the respective deities through the Southern Path (beginning with smoke; see 8.25). Then, after the exhaustion of the results of those sacrifices and the falling of the respective bodies (assumed in those worlds) they return to the human world for rembodiment.'-M.S. (See also 9.20-1.)]
The result of a sacrifice is inevitable even for those who worship ignorantly out of their devotion to other deities. How?
9.25 The worshippers of the gods go to them; to the manes go the ancestor-worshippers; to the deities who preside over the elements go their worshippers; but My devotees come to Me.
9.25 The votaries of the lesser Powers go to them; the devotees of spirits go to them; they who worship the Powers of Darkness, to such Powers shall they go; and so, too, those who worship Me shall come to Me.
9.25. The votaries of the gods attain the gods;  the votaries of the manes attain the manes;  performers of sacrifices for the goblins attain the goblins;  also the performers of scrifices for Me attain Me.
9.25 Devotees of gods go to the gods. The manes-worshippers go to the manes. The worshippers of Bhutas go to the Bhutas. And those who worship Me come to Me.
9.25 Votaries of the gods reach the gods; the votarites of the manes go to the manes; the worshippers of the Beings reach the Beings; and those who worship Me reach Me.
9.25 The term 'Vrata' in the text denotes will, intention or motive. Those who intend to worship gods, like Indra and others with the resolution, 'Let us worship Indra and other gods by ceremonies like the new moon and full moon sacrifices' - such worshippers go to Indra and other gods. Those who intend worshipping manes, resolving 'Let us worship the manes through sacrifices,' - such worshippers go to the manes or others resolving - 'Let us worship the Yaksas, Raksasas,' Pisacas and other evil spirits' - they go to them. But those who, with the same rites of worship, worship Me with the intention, 'Let us worship Lord Vasudeva, the Supreme Self, whose body is constituted of gods, the manes and the evil spirits' - they are My worshippers and they reach Me only.

Those who intend worshipping gods etc., attain gods etc. After sharing limited enjoyment with them, they are destroyed with them when the time comes for their destruction. But My worshippers attain Me, who has no beginning or end, who is omniscient, whose will is unfailingly effective, who is a great ocean of innumerable auspicious attributes of unlimited excellence and whose bliss too is of limitless excellence. They do not return to Samsara. Such is the meaning.

Sri Krsna continues to say, 'There is also another distinguishing characteristic of My worshippers.'
9.24 See Comment under 9.26
9.25 Deva-vratah, votaries of the gods, those whose religious observances [Making offerings and presents, circumambulation, bowing down, etc.] and devotion are directed to the gods; yanti, reach, go to; devan, the gods. Pitr-vratah, the votaries of the manes, those who are occupied with such rites as obseies etc., who are devoted to the manes; go pitrn, to the manes such as Agnisvatta and others. Bhutejyah, the Beings such as Vinayaka, the group of Sixteen (divine) Mothers, the Four Sisters, and others. And madyajinah, those who worship Me, those who are given to worshipping Me, the devotees of Visnu; reach mam, Me alone. Although the effort (involved) is the same, still owing to ingorance they do not worship Me exclusively. Thery they attain lesser results. This is the meaning.
'Not only do My devotees get the everlasting result in the form of non-return (to this world), but My worship also is easy.' How?
9.26 Whoever offers Me with devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or a little water  that, so offered devotedly by the pure-minded, I accept.
9.26 Whatever a man offers to Me, whether it be a leaf, or a flower, or fruit, or water, I accept it, for it is offered with devotion and purity of mind.
9.26. Whosoever with devotion offers Me a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or [a little] water, I taste that offered with devotion by one with well-controlled self  (mind).
9.26 Whoever offers Me with true devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or some water, I accept this offering made with devotion by him who is pure of heart.
9.26 Whoever offers Me with devotion-a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or water, I accept that (gift) of the pure-hearted man which has been devotionally presented.
9.26 Whoever offers to Me with true devotion a leaf, or a flower, or a fruit or water, which can be easily obtained, I accept it. That true devotion is love of such an exalted kind that the devotee cannot sustain himself without making such offering; the devotee has no extraneous purpose other than serving Me. Such an offering coming from a heart rendered pure with that singleness of purpose of considering the offering as an end in itself - I, the Lord of the universe, whose sport consists in the origin, maintenance and dissolution of the entire world, who has all desires fulfilled, whose will is always accomplished, whose auspicious attributes are unlimited and unsurpassed, who is enjoying the infinite and unsurpassed bliss that is in Myself - I accept and enjoy the aforesaid type of offering, as if I was obtaining a desired object far beyond the range of My hopes. Thus it is declared in the Moksa-dharma:  "Whatever acts are consecrated by those whose intellects are concentrated in single-pointed devotion, all these, the Lord Himself accepts on His head."  (Ma. Bha. Sa., 340.64)

Sri Krsna proceeds to say:  As there is this distinctive excellence, incomprehensible by speech and mind in respect of these great men called the Jnanins, you also, following them, become a Jnanin, i.e., have your self and all your belongings 'bent down,' i.e., dedicated, under the weight of Bhakti as prescribed earlier. Be always singing My praises, doing My services, worshipping Me and prostrating before Me; also perform your secular and Vedic duties, periodical and occasional, in this manner.'
9.23-26 Ye' pi etc. upto prayatatmanah.  Even those who worship [gods] with other names, they too [in fact] worship Me alone, becaue there is nothing  (no god) to be worshipped apart from the Brahman.  But the  difference is that  [they do so] by non-injunction.  Non-injunction : different injunctions.  [This amounts to saying that]  having the innate nature of the Absolute Brahman-Existence,  I am indeed worshipped by manifold injunctions (i.e., sacrifices enjoined by injunctions).
 
But non-injunction should not be explained as  'by defective injunction'  as it has been done by others  (other commentators), who acire dirts of great sins by insulting other systems of philosophy.  If their view is correct then the declarations that are actually found viz.,  'They offer sacrifice to Me alone',  and 'I am alone the enjoyer of all sacrifices' - all would be inconsistent.  Enough of talk with the sinful ones.
 
Our preceptors, however,  explain  [ye'pyanya-etc.] as follows :  Those who,  following the principle of the doctrine of duality consider certain deity as different from their own Self and as devoid of the innate nature of the Brahman, and offer sacrifice to that deity only-but it is only to Me, their own Self that even those men offer their sacrifices, however by  non-injunction  i.e. by faulty injunction of the nature of duality-view.  That is why  [the Lord] says  (in verse 25)  'They do not recognise Me, their own Self, correctly as that deity itself,  i.e.,  as the enjoyer  [of the oblation of the sacrifice].  Hence they move away from My nature .  Why ? By being votaries of gods, they attain the gods etc.  (verse 26).  It amounts to say that this [fact of attaining these gods] is itself nothing but moving away  [from Me, the Self].  On the other hand, those who realise My nature (i.e. Me)  as  being not different  [from their  Self],  they offer sacrifices to Me alone, even though those sacrifices etc. are for the gods, goblins and manes.'  [The Lord] is going to conclude  [the present topic] as :  '(Thus)  offering sacrifice to Me they attain Me alone.'  (IX-29,35).
 
But that alone is called a deity which is aimed at [according to injunction],  for offering things  (i.e. oblation).  Hence, how  can a sacrifice be offered to one's own Self, a category  that cannot be aimed at ?  For example, there is the injunction:  'The oblation [of rice]  of the rite prayana, crooked in the milk, is intended for the deity Aditi';  and hence this Aditi becomes the object intended  [in the sacrifice], because that particular deity is an adjunct of an injunction, and because it is included in the injunction as one to be aimed at.  But [in the present case],  there is no injunction that concerns the Self. Having  [these objections] in mind  [the Lord] says :  [They offer sacrifice] to Me following non-injunction.
 
The idea is this :  An injunction is reired only in the case of a deity that is different from one's own Self.  For, the injunction is one of the nature of imparting the knowledge only of that particular thing which is not known  [otherwise].  But, one's own  Self, the Absolute Lord, is known, not following any injunction.  For, the knowledge of the Self is not brought by injunction.  Certainly no action is undertaken not  aiming the  Self.  Therefore in all cases  [of offerings], intended for the deities like Indra etc., this Self of one's own is certainly intended , as the Self is, by nature, the illuminator of the entire Universe;  as It is like a thread in a garland; and as It is   illumining  [on Its own accord],  asserting Its superiority  [over all others] and  only serving as a background (bhittih, 'a screen', or  'a wall') of the manifestations of the deity so intended by  him  [in the sacrifice].  Thus it is established by logic that even the votaries of gods offer sacrifices to Me  (the Absolute)  alone, becuase  'I'  depends on no injunction.
 
As far as these sacrificers are concerned, the principal effect of the sacrifice viz., attaining  'Me', is not intended by them as their own.  On the other hand, they are very much satisfied with attaining the status of Indra etc., just as a priest  is satisfied with limited fees.  To indicate this, the parasmaipada  form  (yajanti)  [is used].  For, it has been stated by myself  (Ag.)  [else-where] as :
 
'One, who knows the Vedas and does not know  [to intend for]  the status of  (or the word)  Sambhu  (the Absolute), would feel afflicted in despair.  [For], aspiring for the heaven, and [hence]  rejecting the status of  [the actual]  performer of of sacrifice  (yajamana),  [but at the same time]  performing sacrifice for others  (yajan),  he has become a  [mere]  priest in the sacrifice.  Indeed, the divergently flowing floods of taste for action,  without exception, - even though they flow from the Absolute consciousness - do not bestow  [on the performer]  the mighty ocean of Bliss of one's own Self if they do not gain a complete  stability'
 
Thus whosoever realises in the said manner, his sacrifice,  though aimed at the deities like Indra, is in fact a sacrifice offered to the Absolute Lord.		
 Whatever may be the other actions of  his, they too become acts of worshipping his own Self, the Absolute Lord, as It alone is intended in all his action.  This  [the Lord] says :
9.26 Yah, whoever; prayaccati, offers; me, Me; bhaktya, with devotion; patram, a leaf; puspam, a flower phalam, a fruit; or toyam, water; asnami, I accept; tat, that (gift)-leaf etc.; prayata-atmanah, of the pure-hearted man; which has been bhakti-upahrtam devotionally presented.
Since this is so, therefore-
9.27 Whatever thou doest, whatever thou eatest, whatever thou offerest in sacrifice, whatever thou givest, whatever thou practisest as austerity, O Arjuna, do it as an offering unto Me.
9.27 Whatever thou doest, whatever thou dost eat, whatever thou dost sacrifice and give, whatever austerities thou practisest, do all as an offering to Me.
9.27. Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever oblation you offer, whatever gift you make and what-ever austerity you perform, O son of Kunti, do  that as an offering to Me.
9.27 Whatsoever you do, whatsoever you eat, whatsoever you offer, whatsoever you give away, whatsoever austerity you practise, O Arjuna, do that as an offering to Me.
9.27 O son of Kunti, whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer as a sacrifice, whatever you give and whatever austerities you undertake, (all) that you offer to Me.
9.27 Whatsoever worldly work you do for the sustenance of the body, whatsoever you set aside for the sustenance of the body, whatsoever Vedic acts, obligatory and occasional, like offerings, charity and austerity you practise - do all that as an offering to Me. 'Arpana' is offering. Do all acts, secular and Vedic, as if the doer, the enjoyer and the worshipped were all offerings to Me. The import is this:  The divinities etc., who are the objects of sacrificial worship, charities etc., and you, the agent and experiencer - all belong to Me and have their essence, existence and actions dependent on Me. Thus only to Me, the supreme Principal (Sesi) and supreme agent, offer everything - yourself as the agent, experiencer and worshipper, all the host of divinities who are the object of worship and the sum of actions constituting the worship. Actuated by overwhelming love, contemplate yourself and other factors such as the objects of worship, as dependent on Me as My Sesas, and hence as of a nature that finds delight only in subservience to Me.
9.27 See Comment under 9.28
9.27 O son of Kunti, yat-karosi, whatever you do, what comes spontaneously; [Actions such as walking etc. that are spontaneous,not injunctions of the scriptures.] yad-asnasi, whatever you eat; and yat-juhosi, whatever you offer as a sacrifice, whatever sacrifices you perform-be it prescribed by the Vedas or by the Smrtis; yatadadasi, whatever you give-gold, food, clarified butter, etc. to Brahmanas and others; and yat-tapasyasi, whatever austerties you undertake; (all) tat, that; kurusva madarpanam, you offer to Me.
'Hear what happens to you when you act thus.'
9.28 Thus shalt thou be freed from the bonds of actions yielding good and evil fruits; with the mind steadfast in the Yoga of renunciation, and liberated, thou shalt come unto Me.
9.28 So shall thy action be attended by no result, either good or bad; but through the spirit of renunciation thou shalt come to Me and be free.
9.28. Thus, you shall be freed from the good and evi results which are the action-bonds.  Having your innate nature immersed in the Yoga of renunciation and (thus) being fully liberated you shall attain Me.
9.28 Thus eipped in mind with the Yoga of renunciation, you will free yourself from the bonds of Karma, productive of auspicious as well as inauspicious fruits. Thus liberated, you will come to Me.
9.28 Thus, you will become free from bondage in the form of actions which are productive of good and bad results. Havng your mind inbued with the yoga of renunciation and becoming free, you will attain Me.
9.28 Thus, eipped with a mind which is firmly set in Yoga, called Sannyasa, considering yourself as one whose delight lies in being a subsidiary (Sesa) to Me and subject to My control and all acts to be My worship, and engaging yourself in secular and Vedic actions with such an attitude, you will free yourself from countless bonds, called ancient Karmas, productive of auspicious and inauspicious results which stands as a hindrance preventing you from attaining Me. Freed from them, you shall come to Me only.

Listen now, to My supreme nature which transcends the world:
9.27-28 Yat karosi etc.  Subhasubha - etc.  Because the performers of sacrifices intending other deities have  in their mind only limited purpose,  and  [hence]  belitle  the [principal]  result  [of the sacrifice etc.];  therefore all [actions] you should offer, by the method advised above,  to Me i.e.,  consider them to be absorbed in Me (or to be born of Me).   This is the renunciation-Yoga.  Extensively it has already been made almost ite clear.
9.28 By dedicating to Me evam, thus; maksyase, you will become free; karma-bandhanaih, from bondage in the form of actions-actions themselves being the bonds; subha-asubha-phalaih, which are productive of good and bad results-i.e. from actions that have desirable (subha) and undesireable (asubha) results (phala).
Sannyasa, renunciation, is that which results from dedication (of actions) to Me, and that is also yoga since it involves actions. He who has his mind (atma) endowed (yukta) with that yoga of renunciation (sannyasa-yoga) is sannyasa-yoga-yukta-atma.
You, being such, having your mind endowed with the yoga of renunciation, and vimuktah, becoming free from the bonds of actions evern while living; upaisyasi, will attain, come; mam, to Me, when this body falls.
In that case the Lord is possessed of love and hatred inasmuch as He favours the devotees, and not others? That is not so:
9.29 The same am I to all beings; to Me there is none hateful or dear; but those who worship Me with devotion are in Me and I am also in them.
9.29 I am the same to all beings. I favour none, and I hate none. But those who worship Me devotedly, they live in Me, and I in them.
9.29. I am the same in all beings; to Me none is hateful and none is dear; but whosoever worship Me with devotion, they are in Me and I am in them.
9.29 I am the same to all creation. There is none hateful or dear to Me. But those who worship Me with devotin abide in Me and I do abide in them.
9.29 I am impartial towards all beings; to Me there is none detastable or none dear. But those who worship Me with devotion, they exist in Me, and I too exist in them.
9.29 Being a refuge for all, I am the same to all creation, be they gods, animals, men or immovables, who exist differentiated from the highest to the lowest according to their birth, form, nature and knowledge. With regard to those seeking refuge, none is hateful because of inferiority in status by birth, form, nature, knowledge etc. No one is discarded as an object of odium. Likewise, it is not that one who has resorted to Me is dear to Me on account of any consideration like birth, status etc. That he has taken refuge in Me is the only consideration. The meaning is no one is accepted as a refuge for reasons like birth. But those who worship Me as their sole objective I like, because I am exceedingly dear to them, and because they find it impossible to sustain themselves without My worship. So they abide in Me, irrespective of whether they are exalted or humble by birth etc. They abide in Me, as if they possess alities eal to Mine. I also abide in them, as if they are My superiors. Moreover:
9.29 See Comment under 9.31
9.29 Aham, I; am samah, impartial, eal; sarva-bhutesu, towards all beings; me, to Me; na asti, there is none; dvesyah, detestable; na, none; priyah, dear. I am like fire: As fire does not ward off cold from those who are afar, but removes it from those who apporach, near, similarly I favour the devotees, not others. Tu, but; ye, those who approach near, similarly I favour the devotees, not others. Tu, but; ye, those who; bhajanti, worship Me, God; bhaktya, with devotion; te they; exist mayi, in Me-by their very nature; ['Their mind becomes fit for My manifestation, as it has been purified by following the virtuous path.'] they do not exist in Me because of My love, Ca, and; aham, I; api, too; naturally exist tesu, in them, not in others. Thus there is no hatred towards them (the latter).
'Listen to the greatness of devotion to Me:'
9.3 Those who have no faith in this Dharma (knowledge of the Self), O Parantapa (Arjuna), return to the path of this world of death without attaining Me.
9.3 They who have no faith in this teaching cannot find Me, but remain lost in the purlieus of this perishable world.
9.3. O scorcher of foes !  Having no faith in this Dharma, persons do not attain Me and remain eternally in the circuit of mundane existence, wrought with death.
9.3 Men devoid of faith in this Dharma, O scorcher of foes, ever remain without attaining Me, in the mortal pathway of Samsara.
9.3 O destroyer of foes, persons who are regardless of this Dharma (knowledge of the Self) certainly go round and round, without reaching Me, along the path of transmigration which is fraught with death.
9.3 Some men who even after attaining the state fit for the practice of this Dharma which is called Upasana (worship) - which is immensely dear inasmuch as it has for its goal Myself who am incomparably dear, and which is the means for the attainment of Myself forming the supreme good that does not perish - may still 'lack faith' in it. Such persons who lack faith which reires eagerness for realization, will not attain Me but remain in the mortal pathway of Samsara. O how strange it is - this hindrance caused by evil Karma! Such is the meaning. [It means, that to declare that one has faith in a spiritual doctrine and yet to take no steps to put it into practice, is pure hypocrisy.]

Listen then to the inconceivable glory of Myself, who am the goal tobe attained:
9.3 Asraddadhanah etc.  They remain eternally :  Again and again they are born and they die.
9.3 Parantapa, O destroyer of foes; those purusah, persons, again; who are asraddadhanah, regardless of, devoid of faith in; asya dharmasya, this Dharma, this knowledge of the Self-those who are faithless as regards its true nature as well as its result, who are sinful, who have taken recourse to the 'upanisad' (mystical teaching) of demoniacal people, consisting in consideration the body alone as the Self, and who delight in life (sense enjoyments); nivartante, certainly go round and round;-where?-mrtyu-samsara-vartmani, along the path (vartma) of transmigration (samsara) fraught with death (mrtyu), the path leading to hell, birth as low creatures, etc., i.e., they go round and round along that very path; aprapya, without reaching; mam, Me, the supreme God. Certainly there is no estion of their attaining Me. Hence, the implication is that (they go round and round) without even aciring a little devotion, which is one of the disciplines [Ast. omits the word sadhana, disciplines.-Tr.] constituting the path for reaching Me.
Having drawn Arjuna's attention through the (above) eulogy, the Lord says:
9.30 Even if the most sinful worships Me, with devotion to none else, he too should indeed by regarded as righteous for he has rightly resolved.
9.30 Even the most sinful, if he worship Me with his whole heart, shalt be considered righteous, for he is treading the right path.
9.30. Even if an incorrigible evil-doer worships Me, not resorting to anything else [as his goal], he should be deemed to be righteous; for,  he has undertaken his task properly.
9.30 If even the most sinful man worships Me with undivided devotion, he must be regarded as holy, for he has rightly resolved.
9.30 Even if a man of very bad conduct worships Me with one-pointed devotion, he is to be considered verily good; for he has resolved rightly.
9.30 Even though he has transgressed rules that ought to be followed and has failed to avoid what a person belonging to a particular class should avoid, if he has begun to worship Me in the manner described above with undivided devotion, namely, with worship as the only purpose - such a person must be considered highly righteous. He is eminent among the worshippers of Visnu. He must be esteemed as fit for honour. The meaning is that he is eal to those Jnanins mentioned earlier. What can be the reason for this?  The reason is that, he has rightly resolved, i.e., his resolve is in the proper direction. 'The Lord who forms the sole cause of the entire universe, who is the Supreme Brahman, Narayana, the Lord of all mobile and immobile beings, is our Master, our Teacher, and our Friend, highest object of enjoyment,' - such a resolve is difficult to be made by all. Its effect, unremitting worship which has no other purpose, will be found in him who makes such a resolve. Hence he is holy and is to be highly honoured. When this resolve, and unremitting worship which is its effect, are found in a person, he is not to be belittled; for, his transgression of rules is a negligible mistake compared to this kind of excellence. On the other hand he is to be regarded with high honour. Such is the meaning.

No, if it be said that transgression of rules will annul the flow of worship, as declared in the Sruti passages like, 'One who has not ceased from bad conduct, is not tranil, is not composed and also not calm in mind, cannot obtain Him through intelligence' (Ka. U., 1.2.24), Sri Krsna replies:
9.30 See Comment under 9.31
9.30 Api cet, even if; su-duracarah, a man of very bad conduct, of extremely vile behaviour, of very condemnable character; bhajate, worships; mam, Me; ananyabhak, with one-pointed devotion, with his mind not given to anybody else; he; mantavyah, is to be considered, deemed; eva, verily; sadhuh, good, as well behaved; hi, for; sah, he; samyakvyavasitah, has resolved rightly, has virtuous intentions.
9.31 Soon he becomes righteous and attains to eternal peace; O Arjuna, proclaim thou for certain that My devotee never perishes.
9.31 He shall attain spirituality ere long, and Eternal Peace shall be his. O Arjuna! Believe me, My devotee is never lost.
9.31. Quickly he becomes righteous-souled (minded) and attains peace permanently.  O son of Kunti !  I swear that my devotee gets never lost.
9.31 Quickly he becomes righteous and obtains everlasting peace. Affirm on My behalf, O Arjuna, My devotee never perishes.
9.31 He soon becomes possessed of a virtuous mind; he attains everlasting peace. Do you proclain boldly, O son of Kunti, that My devotee does not get ruined.
9.31 Quickly he becomes righteous, the Gunas of Rajas and Tamas in him being eradicated with their roots, as he has shaken off all evils through the worship of Myself without any ulterior motive but only because of My being dear to him. Quickly he becomes one whose mind is specially attuned to My worship with all the ancillaries and having all the obstacles removed. It is this kind of worship which was alluded to by the term. Dharma at the commencement of this chapter thus:  'Asraddhadanah purusa dharmasy'asya' etc., (9.3). Such a person obtains enduring peace, i.e., he attains to an eternal state, free from conduct contrary to the attainment of Myself, and from which there will be no return to Samsara. O Arjuna, you may affirm that one who has begun to worship Me in this way will not perish even though he is tarnished by some misconduct in the past. On account of his devotion to Me, he annihilates the entire host of obstacles. After obtaining eternal state of freedom from obstacles, he ickly obtains perfect Bhakti.
9.29-31 Ksipram etc.  I swear  etc.  This result  (or subject), has logic  [as its strong basis]  and now being promised by the Bhagavat,  it becomes established most firmly.
9.31 Having given up his external evil behaviour due to the strength of his internal proper resolves, ksipram bhavati, he soon becomes; verily dharma-atma, possessed of a virtuous mind; and nigaccahti, he attains; sasvat, everlasting; santim, peace, ietude [Cessation of evil acts.]. O son of Kunti, listen to the supreme Truth: Pratijanihi, do you proclaim boldly, make a firm declaration; that me, My; bhaktah, devotee, who has dedicated his inner being to Me; na, does not; pranasyati, get ruined.
Moreover,
9.32 For, taking refuge in Me, they also who, O Arjuna, may be of a sinful birth  women, Vaisyas as well as Sudras  attain the Supreme Goal.
9.32 For even the children of sinful parents, and those miscalled the weaker sex, and merchants, and labourers, if only they will make Me their refuge, they shall attain the Highest.
9.32. O son of Prtha, even those who are of sinful birth, [besides]  women, men of working class, and the members of the fourth caste-even they, having taken refuge in Me, attain the highest goal.
9.32 By taking refuge in Me even men of evil birth, women, Vaisyas and also Sudras attain the supreme state.
9.32 For, O son of Prtha, even those who are born of sin-women, Vaisyas, as also Sudras [S.'s construction of this portion is: women, Vaisyas as also Sudras, and even others who are born of sin (i.e., those who are born low and are of vile deeds, viz Mlecchas, Pukkasas and others). M.S. also takes papa-yonayah (born of sin) as a separate phrase, and classifies women and others only as those darred from Vedic study, etc.-Tr.]-, even they reach the highest Goal by taking shelter under Me.
9.32 - 9.33 Women, Vaisyas and Sudras, and even those who are of sinful birth, can attain the supreme state by taking refuge in Me. How much more then the well-born Brahmanas and royal sages who are devoted to me! Therefore, roayl sage that you are, do worship Me, as you have come to this transient and joyless world stricken by the threefold afflictions.

Sri Krsna now describes the nature of Bhakti:
9.32 See Comment under 9.34
9.32 Hi, for; O son of Prtha, ye api, even those; papayonayah syuh, who are born of sin;-as to who they are, the Lord says-striyah, women; vaisyah, Vaisyas, tatha, as also; sudrah, Sudras; te api, even they; yanti, reach, go to; the param, highest; gatim, Goal vyapasritya, by taking shelter; mam, under Me-by accepting Me as their refuge.
9.33 How much more (easily) then the hold Brahmins and devoted royal saints (attain the goal); having come to this impermanent and unhappy world, do thou worship Me.
9.33 What need then to mention the holy Ministers of God, the devotees and the saintly rulers? Do thou, therefore, born in this changing and miserable world, do thou too worship Me.
9.33. Certainly it should be so in the case of the pious men of the priestly class and of the devoted royal seers.  Having come to (i.e., being born in) this transient and joyless world, you should be devoted to Me.
9.33 How much more then the Brahmanas and royal sages who are pure and are My devotees! Having obtained this transient, joyless world, worship Me.
9.33 What to speak of the holy Brahmanas as also of devout kind-sages! Having come to this ephemeral and miserable world, do you worship Me.
9.32 - 9.33 Women, Vaisyas and Sudras, and even those who are of sinful birth, can attain the supreme state by taking refuge in Me. How much more then the well-born Brahmanas and royal sages who are devoted to me! Therefore, roayl sage that you are, do worship Me, as you have come to this transient and joyless world stricken by the threefold afflictions.

Sri Krsna now describes the nature of Bhakti:
9.32 See Comment under 9.34
9.33 Kim punah, what to speak of; the punyah brahmanah, holy Bramanas, of sacred birth; tatha, as also; of the bhaktah, devout; rajarsayah, kind-sages-those who are kings and, at the same time, sages! Since this is so, therefore, prapya, having come; imam, to this; anityam, ephemeral, ever changeful; and asukham, miserable, unhappy; lokam, world, the human world-having attained this human life which is a means to Liberation; bhajasva, do you worship, devoted yourself; mam to Me.
How?
9.34 Fix thy mind on Me; by devoted to Me; sacrifice unto Me; bow down to Me; having thus united thy whole self to Me, taking Me as the supreme goal, thou shalt come unto Me.
9.34 Fix thy mind on Me, devote thyself to Me, sacrifice for Me, surrender to Me, make Me the object of thy aspirations, and thou shalt assuredly become one with Me, Who am thine own Self."
9.34. Have your mind fixed on Me; be My devotee; offer scrifice to Me; [and] pay homage to Me; thus fixing your self (internal organ) and having Me as your supreme goal, you shall certainly attain Me.
9.34 Focus your mind on Me, be My devotee, be my worshipper. Bow down to Me. Engaging your mind in this manner and regarding Me as the supreme goal, you will come to Me.
9.34 Having your mind fixed on Me, be devoted to Me, sacrifice to Me, and bow down to Me. By concentrating your mind and accepting Me as the supreme Goal, you shall surely attain Me who am thus the Self.
9.34 Focus your mind on Me; fix your mind on Me uninterruptedly like a continous stream of oil - on Me the Ruler of rulers, antagonistic to all that is evil, the sole abode of auspiciousness, omniscient, whose resolve is always true, the sole cause of the entire universe, the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Person; on Me, of long large eyes like a lotus petal; who has the complexion of a clear blue cloud; whose shining lustre is like that of a thousand suns simultaneously risen; on Me, the great ocean of the nectar of beauty; of four arms, noble and strong, and of brilliant yellow raiment; on Me, adorned with a pure crown, fish-shaped ear-rings, garlands, bracelet on the arms and bangles at the wrist; on Me, the ocean of infinite mercy, affability, beauty, sweetness, majesty, magnanimity and parental affection; on Me, the refuge of all without exception and without regard to their differences; on Me the Lord of all.

Sri Krsna again makes the same clear. Be My devotee. Be one whose mind is focussed on Me by contemplating on Me as exceedingly dear. Such is the meaning. He makes thie yet clearer. Be My worshipper, namely, become engaged in My worship, which you have begun to practise by your experience of Me as supremely dear and unlimited and unsurpassed. What is called worship is the conduct of one who realises that he is absolutely a subsidiary - (Sesa) of God. Worship consists also in offering all things of enjoyment such as waving of lights etc., all those things which come into bodily contact like garlands, sandal paste etc., and those meant for offering like food preparations and other edibles. The meaning is this:  Let your mind be focussed on Me so as to be engaged in My worship, resulting from love which is unlimited and unsurpassed and which is born from the experience of Myself.

Again Sri Krsna expounds the same:  Bow down to Me. Do not be satisfied only with services of one who is absolutely subsidiary to me. Do services which are incomparably dear and animated by an experience of Myself who is dear and unlimited and unsurpassed. Also bow down to Me in utter humility, regarding Me as the supreme goal, i.e., He who is the supreme abode and the supreme goal. 

The meaning is that having resorted to Me, it is impossible for you to live without Me. Having disciplined the mind in this way and considering Me as the supreme goal, you will thus, through love which is unsurpassed and incomparable, obtain a mind which is fit for experiencing Me. You will then reach Me alone. Here the term Atman stands for the mind.

The import is that, holding Me as the sole support, possesing a mind of this kind, meditating on Me, experiencing Me, worshipping Me and bowing down to Me - you will reach Me alone. Thus, with such a turn of mind you carry on, for pleasing Me alone, your secular works for bodily sustenance and Vedic activities like obligatory and occasional rites, regarding them as actuated by Me and finding sole joy in absolute subservience to Me. You shall ever engage yourself in praising My names with love and in endeavouring to serve Me and bowing down to Me etc. You shall contemplate on the entire universe as being under My rule and being subsidiary (Sesa) to Me. Contemplating on the multitudes of My attributes, which are exceedingly dear to you, and practising every day this worship as described, you will reach Me alone.
9.32-34  Man hi  etc; upto  Matparayanah.   Those who are of sinful birth : I.e., the animals, birds, reptiles etc.  Women denotes the ignorant.  Men of working class denotes those who find pleasure in different vocations, like agriculture etc.   Men of the fourth caste :  those who do not have any claim whatsoever for [performing]  the Vedic rituals  and whose livelihood depend on others.  By taking refuge [solely] in Me, even these all attain Me alone.  The deeds of the exceedingly compassionate Bhagavat, like the one granting liberation to a chief of the elephants are heard in thousands [in the Puranas].  Certainly it must be so, for those whose  behaviour is just the opposite to that of these persons.
 
Some (commentators]  declare : The present sentence [of the Lord]  intends  to glorify the twice-born and members of the ruling class, and it is not uttered with the intention of speaking of the attainment of liberation in the case of the women etc.
 
Indeed these persons [aim to]  break into pieces the Graceous-to-all  Power of the Bhagavat by foistering upon It, a limited applicability;  likwise they do not tolerate the profoundly compassionate nature of the Absolute Lord;  they contradict the [Lord's own]  statements  'To Me none is hateful and none is dear (IX, 30)',  'Even a highly evil-doer etc.  (IX, 31)',  and other similar statements, very clearly of the same import; with all effort they  [strive to]  bring in something indicative of duality even in the Absolute-being,  Whose non-dual nature has been well established firmly by the diversity of the best reasonings;  they are not mindful of other contradictions  [that lurk in their theory]  with the revealed literature;  when simply estioned  'How is this ?'  and  'How is that ?',  these persons, having their internal organ totally possessed by the mighty devil of the caste  [considerations],  concealed within, and having their tongue, face and eyes all twisted by their sense of  jealously, hypocrisy and shame-they prattle evil for the entire humanity;  and thus they put upon themselves the status of being an object of  ridicule.  Therefore the above explanation  [of ours]  does good to all.
9.34 Manmana bhava, have your mind fixed on Me; [Here Ast. adds the word vasudeva.-Tr] and also be madbhakah, devoted to Me. Madyaji, sacrifice to Me, be engaged in sacrificing to Me. And namaskuru, bow down; only mam, to Me. Yuktva, by concentrating your mind; and mat-parayanah, by accepting Me as the supreme Goal; esyasi eva, you shall surely attain; mam, Me who am God. You shall attain Me evam atmanam, who am thus the Self: I indeed am the Self of all the beings, and am also the supreme Goal. You shall attain Me who am such. In this way, the word atmanam (Self) is to be connected with the preceding word mam (Me). This is the purport.
9.4 All this world is pervaded by Me in My unmanifest aspect; all beings exist in Me, but I do not dwell in them.
9.4 The whole world is pervaded by Me, yet My form is not seen. All living things have their being in Me, yet I am not limited by them.
9.4. This entire universe is pervaded by Me, having the unmanifest form (aspect);  all beings exist in Me and I do not exist in them.
9.4 This entire universe is pervaded by Me, in an unmanifest form. All beings abide in Me, but I do not abide in them.
9.4 This whole world is prevaded by Me in My unmanifest form. All beings exist in Me, but I am not contained in them!
9.4 This 'entire universe,' composed to sentient and non-sentient beings, is pervaded by Me, the inner controller, whose 'form is not manifest,' namely, whose essential nature is unmanifest. The meaning is that all this is pervaded by Me, the Principal (Sesi), so that I may sustain and rule this universe. This, the pervasion of all by the inner controller, who is invisible to the entire group of sentient and non-sentient beings, is taught in the following passage of the Antaryami-brahmana:  'He who dwells in the earth ৷৷. whom the earth 'does not know' (Br. U., 3.7.3) and 'He who dwells in the self ৷৷. whom the self does not know etc.,' (Br. U. Madh., 3.7.22). Therefore 'all beings abide in Me'; all beings rest in Me who am their inner controller. In the same Brahmana it is taught that their existence and control are dependent on Him, as they are subject to His control and as they constitute His body:  'He whose body is the earth ৷৷. who controls the earth from within' (Br. U., 3.7.3) and 'He whose body is the self ৷৷. He who controls the self from within' (Br. U. Madh., 3.7.22). So also His primacy over everything is taught. 'I am not in them,' namely, I do not 'depend' on them for My existence. There is no help derived from them for My existence.
9.4 Maya etc.  All beings exist in Me :  Because no other abode of  rest is available, even if one wanders [in search of it] for long.  The beings  (or elements)  that form the objects of knowledge possess their well-known nature of insentiency.  When these beings manifest with this nature foremost, their other innate nature viz.,  sentiency, that is opposed to this [former nature], remain hidden.  This is what He says by I do not exist in them.
9.4 Idam, this; sarvam, whole; jagat, world; is tatam, pervaded; maya, by Me; through the supreme nature, that I have, avyakta-murtina, in My unmanifest form, in that form in which My nature is not manifest, i.e. in My form which is beyond the range of the organs.
Sarva-bhutani, all beings, from Brahma to a clump of grass; matsthani, exist in Me, are established in Me in that unmanifest form. For, no created thing that is bereft of the Self (i.e. of Reality) can be conceived of as an object of practical use. Therefore, being possessed of their reality through Me who am their Self, they exist in Me. Hence they are said to be established in Me.
I Myself am the Self of those created things. Conseently, it appears to people of little understanding that I dwell in them. Hence I say: Na ca aham, but I am not; avasthitah, contained; tesu, in them, in the created things. Since unlike gross objects I am not in contact with anything, therefore I am certainly the inmost core even of space. For, a thing that has no contact with anything cannot exist like something contained in a receptacle.
For this very reason that I am not in contact with anyting-
9.5 Nor do beings exist in Me (in reality); behold My divine Yoga, supporting all beings, but not dwelling in them, is My Self, the efficient cause of beings.
9.5 Nevertheless, they do not consciously abide in Me. Such is My Divine Sovereignty that though I, the Supreme Self, am the cause and upholder of all, yet I remain outside.
9.5. Yet, the beings do not exist in Me.  Look at the Sovereign Yoga of Mine.  My Self is the sustainer of the beings, does not exist in beings, and cuases beings to be born.
9.5 And yet beings do not abide in Me. Behold My divine Yoga. I am the upholder of all beings and yet I am not in them. My will alone causes their existence.
9.5 Nor do the beings dwell in Me. Behod My divine Yoga! I am the sustainer and originator of beings, but My Self is not contained in the beings.
9.5 And yet 'beings do not abide in Me,' as I do not support them as a jug or any kind of vessel supports the water contained in them. How then are they contained?  By My will. Behold My divine Yoga power, namely, My wonderful divine modes, unie to Me alone and having no comparison elsewhere. What are these modes?  'I am the upholder of all beings and yet I am not in them - My will sustains all beings.' The meaning is I am the supporter of all beings, and yet I derive no help for Myself whatever from them. My will alone projects, sustains and controls all beings.

He gives an illustration to show how all beings depend on His will for their being and acts:
9.5 Na ca etc. Yet, the beings do not exist in Me :  For, the persons, who are blind with nescience, do not see the reality.  The ignorant  do not consider the Absolute Lord - Who is of the nature of infinite  Consciousness - as a basis of determinate knowledge of all objects.  On the other hand conceiving  [like] 'I, the lean Devadatta,  know this, as existing here on the floor',  they view  [things of]  finite nature aone as the basis  [of determination].
 
But why this contradiction ?  On this doubt  [the Lord] says  Look at the Sovereign Yoga of Mine.  Yoga signifies the  Power  [of the Absolute],  because it is being employed.  This is indeed My Sovereignty,  which is the Freedom of behaving in this manner in a highly strange way.  This is the idea  (here).
9.5 Na ca bhutani, nor do the beings, beginning from Brahma; matsthani, dwell in Me. Pasya, behold; me, My; aisvaram, divine; yogam, Yoga, action, performance, i.e. this real nature of Myself. The Upanisadic text, too, similarly shows the absence of association (of the Self) due to Its being free from contact: '৷৷.unattached, for It is never attached' (Br. 3.9.26). Behold this other wonder: I am the bhuta-bhrt, sustainer of beings, though I am unattached. Ca, but; mama atma, My Self; na bhutasthah, is not contained in the bengs. As it has been explained according to the logic stated above, there is no possibility of Its remaining contained in beings. How, again, is it said, 'It is My Self? Following human understanding, having separated the aggregate of body etc. (from the Self) and superimposing eoism of them, the Lord calls It 'My Self'. But not that He has said so by ignorantly thinking like ordinary mortals that the Self is different from Himself.
So also, I am the bhuta-bhavanah, originator of beings, one who gives birth to or nourishes the beings.
By way of establishing with the help of an illustration the subject-matter [Subject-matter-that the Self, which has no contact with anything, is the substratum of creation, continuance and dissolution.] dealt with in the aforesaid two verses, the Lord says:
9.6 As the mighty wind, moving everywhere, rests always in the ether, even so, know thou that all beings rest in Me.
9.6 As the mighty wind, though moving everywhere, has no resting place but space, so have all these beings no home but Me.
9.6. Just as the mighty wind exists in the ether, always moving [in it] everywhere, in the same manner all beings exist in Me.  Be sure of it.
9.6 As the powerful element air moving everywhere ever remains in the ether, know that so too all beings abide in Me.
9.6 Understand thus that just as the voluminous wind moving everywhere is ever present in space, similarly all beings abide in Me.
9.6 The 'powerful air' remains and moves everywhere in the ether (Akasa) without any perceivable support. So it has necessarily got to be admitted that the powerful air is dependent on Me for its existence and is being upheld by Me alone. Even so know that all entities abide in Me, who am invisible to them, and that they are upheld by Me alone. The knowers of the Veda declare thus:  'The origin of clouds, the waters of the ocean remaining within bounds, the phases of the moon, the strong movements of the gale, the flash of lightning and the movements of the sun - all these are marvellous manifestations of the power of Visnu.' The meaning is that they are all the marvellous miracles which are unie to Visnu. The Srutis and other texts also declare likewise:  'Verily, O Gargi, at the ?nd of that Imperishable One, the sun and the moon stand apart' (Br. U., 3.8.9, and 'Through the fear of Him the wind blows, through the fear of Him the sun rises, through the fear of Him Agni and Indra perform their duties' (Tai. U., 2.8.1).

It has been declared that the existence and acts of all beings originate by the will of the Lord, who is independent of all others. Now Sri Krsna declares that the origin and dissolution of all entities also are due to His will only:
9.6 Yatha etc.  Evam etc.  In spite of the concomitant connection between the ether and the wind, the touchability of the ether is never heard of.  In the same manner the Absolute  pervades the entire universe and yet remains not comprehended by all men.
9.6 Upadharaya, understand; iti, thus; that yatha, just as; in the world, the mahan, voluminous-in dimension; vayuh, wind; sarvatragah, moving everywhere; is nityam, ever; [During creation, continuance and dissolution] akasa-sthitah, present in space; tatha, similarly; (sarvani, all; bhutani, beings; matsthani,) abide in Me who am omnipresent like space-abide certainly without any contact.
9.7 All beings, O Arjuna, go into My Nature at the end of a Kalpa; I send them forth again at the beginning of (the next) Kalpa.
9.7 All beings, O Arjuna, return at the close of every cosmic cycle into the realm of Nature, which is a part of Me, and at the beginning of the next I send them forth again.
9.7. O son of Kunti, all beings pass into the nature [of Mine] at the end of the Kalpa (the age of universe); I send them forth again at the beginning of the [next] Kalpa.
9.7 All beings, O Arjuna, enter into My Prakrti at the end of a cycle of time. Again I send these forth at the beginning of a cycle of time.
9.7 O son Kunti, all the beings go back at the end of a cycle to My Prakrti. I project them forth again at the beginning of a cycle.
9.7 All the mobile and immobile entities enter into My Prakrti at the end of a cycle, namely at the end of Brahma's life in accordance with My will. This Prakrti, constituting My body, is designated by the term Tamas, as it cannot be differentiated into name and form. I again send forth the very same beings at the beginning of a cycle. Manu declares accordingly:  'This universe became Tamas ৷৷. by an act of will. He produced it out of His body' (Manu, 1.5.8). The Srutis also declare thus:  'He whose body is Avyakta' (Su. U., 7); 'The Avyakta merges into Aksara, the Aksara into Tamas' (Ibid., 2); and also 'There was Tamas; the intelligence was concealed by Tamas' (Tai. Br., 1.8.9).
9.7 Sarva- etc. Nature :  unmanifest form.
9.7 Kaunteya, O son of Kunti; sarva-bhutani, all the beings-all the beings which, like wind abiding in space, abide thus in Me during their period of existence; yanti, go back; kalpa-ksaye, at the end of a cycle, at the time of dissolution; mamikam prakrtim, to My Prakrti which consists of the three gunas (alities; see 7.13) and is (called My) lower Nature. Punah, again; aham, I; visrjami, project forth, create; tani, them, the beings, as before [As before: as in previous cycles of creation.]; kalpadau, at the beginning of a cycle, at the time of creation.
9.8 Animating My Nature, I again and again send forth all this multitude of beings, helpless by the force of the Nature.
9.8 With the help of Nature, again and again I pour forth the whole multitude of beings, whether they will or no, for they are ruled by My Will.
9.8. Taking hold of My own nature I send forth again and  again this entire host of beings, which is powerless under the control of  [My] nature.
9.8 Controlling the Prakrti, which is My own, I send forth again and again all this multitude of beings, helpless under the sway of Prakrti.
9.8 Keeping My own prakrti under control, I project forth again and again the whole of this multitude of beings which are powerless owing to the influence of (their own) nature.
9.8 Operating My Prakrti, with its wonderfully variegated potency, I develop it eightfold and send forth this fourfold aggregate of beings, gods, animals, men and inanimate things, time after time. All these entities are helpless, being under the sway of My Prakrti comprising the three Gunas which can cause delusion.

If this is so, it may be urged, inealities of creation can be said to affect the Lord with cruelty, partiality etc. To this, the Lord answers:
9.8 Prakrtim etc.  Taking hold of My own nature :  By this much  [of statement]  it is explained that this host of Beings, though itself insentient,  attains luminosity as it is linked to the Absolute nature of  [Consciousness]
9.8 Thus avastabhya, keeping under control; svam, My own; prakrtim, Prakrti, which is charcterized as nescience; visrjami, I project forth; punah, punah, again and again; the krtsnam, whole of; imam, this; existing bhuta-gramam, multitude of beings which are born of Prakrti; which, being under another's sub-jugation due to such defects [See under 8.19, introductory Commentary.-Tr.] as ignorance etc., are avasam, powerless, not independent; prakrteh vasat, under the influence of their own nature.
'In that case, You, who are the supreme God and who ordain this multitude of beings uneally, will become associated with virtue and vice as a result of that act?'
In aswer the Lord says this"
9.9 These acts do not bind Me, O Arjuna, sitting like one indifferent, unattached to those acts.
9.9 But these acts of mine do not bind Me. I remain outside and unattached.
9.9. O Dhananjaya !  These acts do not bind Me, remaining as if unconcerned and unattached in these actions.
9.9 But these actions do not bind Me, O Arjuna, for I remain detached from them like one unconcerned.
9.9 O Dhananjaya (Arjuna), nor do those actions bind Me, remaining (as I do) like one unconcerned with, and unattached to, those actions.
9.9 But actions like uneal creation do not bind Me. There can be no imputation of cruelty etc., to Me, because the previous actions (Karmas) of individual selves are the causes for the ineality of conditions like that of gods etc. I am untouched by the ineality. I sit, as it were, apart from it as one unconcerned. Accordingly, the author of the Vedanta-sutras says:  'Not ineality and cruelty, on account of (creation) being dependent, for so scripture declares' (Br. Su., 2.1.34), and 'If it be said that there is no Karma on account of non-distinction, it is replied that it is not proper to say so, because it is beginningless ৷৷.' (Ibid., 2.1.35). [The idea is this:  Creation has no first beginning. It is an eternal cyclic process of creation and dissolution of the universe. So the differentiation of Karma, Jiva and Isvara even before creation has to be accepted. Only in the creative cycle the differentiation becomes patent, and in the dissolved condition it remains latent.]
9.9 See Comment under 9.10
9.9 O Dhananjaya, na ca, nor do; tani, those; karmani, actions-which are the sources of the creation of the multitude of beings uneally; nibadhnanti, bind; mam, Me, who am God. As to that, the Lord states the reason for His not becoming associated with the actions: Asinam, remaining (as I do); udasinavat, like one unconcerned, like some indifferent spectator- for the Self is not subject to any change; and asaktam, unattached; tesu karmasu, to those actions-free from attachment to results, free from the egoism that 'I do.'
Hence, even int he case of any other person also, the absence of the idea of agentship and the absence of attachment to results are the causes of not getting bound. Otherwise, like the silkworm, a foolish man becomes bound by acitons. This is the idea.
There (in th previous two verses) it involves a contradiction to say, 'Remaining like one unconcerned, I project forth this multitude of beings.' In order to dispel this doubt the Lord says:
