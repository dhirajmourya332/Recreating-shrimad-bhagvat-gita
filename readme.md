# Recreating Shrimad Bhagvat Gita Using Simple Markov Model

## This was simple project that I worked on when I was learning about Markov model and related problems like Markov Chain absorption

In this project I scraped translations of Shrimad Bhagvat Gita from different sources, filtered it, toknized it and made a markov model of it

When starting from any point like "o sanjaya !" (3 ngram use here), and choosing next random word occurences and keep iterating, it created preety intresting sentences (ofcourse a lot of them didn't made any sense)

- o arjuna , though not as sanctioned by the sastras and demand much exertion , those who surrender their actions to me and making me attached to happiness'- ( by thinking ) in these ways one dislikes them because of his sins not being annulled but is none the less struggling for winning knowledge of the absolute , the reality of vasudeva , such as ' o krsna , or enjoyment or even life ?

- o arjuna , know yoga to be that which becomes transformed . so the vedas serve as the protectors of the world . one should know the maya to be the leaves ' , since this tree of the world becomes ensured when the brahmanas and the vedas and perform the rituals inculcated in them , nor even by sacrifice can i be seen and known , only thus can a man become concentrated ? that is to lead to lapses

- o arjuna , practises what is good . both can be undertaken ( only ) for their own destruction with full speed , the moths enter into the flaming fire for their own selves . those persons who care for their own sake verily eat sin

- o arjuna , there is not the meaning of 'individual self ' for the 'world of death ' ( pitr-loka ) .-tr . ] he says , ' i am divinity , i am statesmanship , and also on all the subjects dealt with , and unattached to , those actions
