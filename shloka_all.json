  "dhrtarastra said  o sanjaya ! what did my men and the sons of pandu do in the kuruksetra, the field of  righteousness, where the entire warring class has assembled ? or o sanjaya !  what did the selfish intentions and the intentions born of wisdom do in the human body which is the field-of-duties,  the repository of the senseorgans and in which all the murderous ones (passions and asceticism etc.) are confronting [each other]",

  "dharmaksetre etc. here some [authors] offer a different explanation as1 :-kuruksetra : the man's body is the ksetra i.e., the facilitator, of the kurus, i.e., the sense-organs. 2 the same is the field of all wordly duties, since it is the cuse of their birth , which is also the field of the righteous act that has been described as :  'this is the highest righteous act viz., to realise the self by means of the yogas' ,   and which is the protector4 [of the embodied self] by achieving emancipation [by means of this], through the destruction of all duties. it is the location where there is the confrontation among all ksatras, the murderous ones-because the root ksad means 'to kill' - viz, passion and asceticism, wrath and forbearance, and others that stand in the mutual relationship of the slayer and the slain. those that exist in it are the mamakas,-i.e., the intentions that are worthy of man of ignorance and are the products of ignorance-and those that are born of pandu: i.e., the intentions, of which the soul is the very knowledge itself5 and which are worthy of persons of pure knowledge. what did they do? in other words, which were vanished by what? mamaka : a man of ignorance as he utters [always] 'mine'6. pandu : the pure one.7",

  "the lord said  o arjuna, i shall tell you my auspicious manifestations - those that are prominent among these. the term 'pradhanya' connotes pre-eminence. for it will be said, 'know me to be the chief among family priests' (10.24). i shall declare to you those that are prominent in the world. for it would not be possible to tell or listen to them in detail, because there is no limit to them. to be a vibhuti, the manifestation referred to should be under the control of the lord , because it is stated:  'he who in truth knows this supernal manifestation and the seat of auspicious attributes' (10.7), after listing the various kinds of mental dispositions like intelligence etc., of all beings. similarly it has been stated there that 'being the creator etc.,' is meant by the term yoga, and that their 'being actuated,' meant by the term vibhuti. again it is stated:  'i am the origin of all , from me proceed everything , thinking thus, the wise worship me with all devotion' (10.8).  sri krsna clearly declares that he rules over all creatures by actuating them from within as their self. he also declares his being the creator, sustainer and destroyer of everything, as connected by the term yoga",

  "i am the self, o arjuna, dwelling in the hearts of all beings. i am the beginning, the middle and also the end of all beings",
  "o gudakesa, i am the self residing in the hearts of all beings, and i am the beginning and the middle as also the end of (all) beings",
  "i am the self dwelling in the heart of all beings who constitute my body. what is called 'self' is in every way the supporter, controller and the principal of a body. it is further declared:  'and i am seated in the hearts of all , from me are memory, knowledge and their removal' (15.15), and 'the lord dwells, o arjuna in the heart of every being causing them to spin round and round by his power, as if set on a wheel' (18.61). the srutis also declare:  'he who, dwelling in all beings, is within all beings, whom all beings do not know, whose body all beings are, who controls all beings from within, is your inner controller, immortal self (br. u., 3.7.15) , and 'he who, dwelling in the self is within the self, whom the self does not know, whose body the self is, and who controls the self from within, he is your inner controller and immortal self' (sata. br., 14.5.30). thus, i am the self of all beings and i am their beginning, the middle and also the end. the meaning is that i am the cause of their origination, sustentation and dissolution.  thus, having explained that the lord's immanence in all beings, which are his manifestations having him, as their self, is the ground for naming them in the manner of samanadhikaranya or co-ordinate predication with him (i.e., predication that they are he himself), sri krsna proceeds to present some specific or distinguished manifestations in the same style of co-ordinate predication. as the lord abides as the self in all, the final significance of all terms culminates in him. terms such as god, man, bird, tree etc., though they signify the respective physical forms of those objects, they culminate through them in the selves in them as their final significance. just like that here it is going to be stated in the conclusion of the account of the manifestations of the lord, that the lord's immanence in them all as their self is the basis for describing them in such co-ordinate predication (as he himself). the text 'there is nothing, moving or unmoving, apart from me' (10.39) says that they are inseparable from him, and this inseparability is the result of their being under his control. this has been initially declared in the words 'all proceed from me' (10.8).  [this word samanadhikaranya is translated by some also as 'grammatical co-ordination.' it is a context in which a number of words, usually having varying denotations, are used to signify an identical object. this kind of co-ordinate relation occurs in all the following verses in which sri krsna eates himself with various objects having different denotations as atman, visnu among the adityas, indra, marici, sankara, kubera, etc. further explanation is given in the commentary.]",

  "he who exists 'without being born' at any particular time unlike other beings is 'unborn' in the sense of being eternal. for, this attribute denotes a unie state distinct in kind both from insentient things which are subject to modifications, and from the self in its state of involvement in samsara when it is united with insentient matter. in that state the birth of the self involved in matter is generated by karma. the temr 'anadi', or without beginning, is used to distinguish the state of the lord, which is distinct in kind, from that of the liberated state which is birthless but can be said to have a beginning. for, to the liberated self, the state of liberation has a beginning, because, in regard to this, conjunction with matter which deserves to be abandoned, existed previously. hence the term 'anadi' implies that the lord is without such conjunction and does not deserve the same description. the sruti also says:  'him who is stainless' (sve. u., 4.19).  thus, he who is undeluded among the mortals understands me as 'the great lord of the worlds,' as the lord of the lords of the worlds. my nature is incompatible with association with evil which has to be given up. what is called 'delusion' is the wrong knowledge of taking me as one among other entities of the same kind. to be bereft of this delusion is to be 'undeluded'. such a person is released from all sins which stand against the rise of bhakti to me.  the meaning is this:  in this world, the king who rules over men is only like all those men. he has become a ruler by some good karma. such is not the case with the lord of the gods (the supreme being). even the lord of the cosmic egg (brahma) is of the same class as other beings in samsara, because he too is a created being coming within the threefold classification of beings according to the three innate tendencies for growth - namely karma-bhavana, brahma-bhavana and ubhaya-bhavana. these three are described respectively as fitness to practise work alone, fitness to practise meditation alone and fitness to practise both together. brahma comes under the third group. the sruti also says, 'he who creates brahma' (sve. u., 6.18). the same is the case with all those who have acired the eight superhuman powers like becoming atomic etc. but i, the supreme being, is the great lord of the worlds. he who is not subject to the delusion of regarding me as of the same order as others, - such a person knows me as distinct in kind from non-conscient matter in its states as cause and effect, from the self whether bound or free, and from everything else, on account of all of them being subject to my control. i am antagonistic to all that is evil and i am the sole centre of innumerable auspicious attributes, unsurpassed and incomparable. it is also my inherent nature to be the controller of everything. one who understands me to be all this is released from every sin.  thus, after showing the annihilation, by meditation on his nature, of all evil impeding the rise of bhakti, and also of the rise of devotion, through implication, by the destruction of such opposing factors, sri krsna now explains the way in which bhakti develops by meditation on his sovereign power and on the multitude of his auspicious attributes:",

'mahatman' means one, the dimension of whose mind has no limits. it has to be understood that like arjuna, other beings also were granted by the lord the divine eye capable of directly perceiving the form which supports the universe. if it be asked why, the reply is that it was for demonstrating to arjuna his sovereignty. hence it is stated here:  'beholding your marvellous and terrible form, o mahatman, the three worlds are greatly overwhelmed with fear.'",

  " tasmat etc.  drona etc.  the world is of the nature of perfect and imperfect knowledge and it is swallowed  (11.completely controlled)  by the power of the perfect,  imperfect and  mixed  consciousness.   hence, here an answer is given accordingly by the bhagavat.  this secret is a almost  indicated in this chapter.  yet  for the benefit of those  persons who are capable of understanding only what has been clearly marked, let us (11.ag.)  assume the misfortune of taking the trouble of writing a few lines.   what is declared by the bhagavat - viz.,  'as the foes have been slain  [by me],  be a token cause and win glory',  this is by way of answering to what arjuna has said earlier viz.,  'we do not know who, amongst both of us,  is more powerful than the other etc.  (11.ii, 6)'",
  "by saying, 'who have been killed by me,' the lord names drona and those very warriors with regard to whom arjuna had (his) doubts. now then, uncertainty with regard to drona and bhisma is well-founded. drona was the teacher of the science of archery, and was eipped with heavenly weapons , and particularly, he was his (arjuna's) own teacher and most respected. bhisma was destined to die at will, and possessed heavenly weapons. he fought a duel with parasurama and remained unvanished. so also jayadratha-whose father was performing an austerity with the idea that anyone who made his son's head fall on the ground would have even his own head fall. since karna also was eipped with an unerring spear given by indra, and was a son of the sun, born of a maiden (kunti), therefore he is referred to by his own name itself. as a mere instrument, tvam, you , jahi, destory them , who have been hatan, killed , maya, by me. ma, do not , vyathisthah, be afraid of them. yuddhyasva, fight. jetasi, you shall coner , the sapatnan, enemies-duryodhana and others , rane, in battle",

(2) on the other hand there are those who meditate on the 'imperishable', (aksara) namely, the individual self in its true nature, which is the same as the 'unmanifest' (avyakta), namely that whose nature cannot be grasped by organs such as the eye etc. the estion posed is:  which of these two classes of devotees have greater knowledge of yoga?  who would reach their respective goals sooner?  such is the meaning of the estion. sri krsna clearly states later on, 'o arjuna, i become before long their redeemer from the fatal sea of recurring births and deaths' (12.7), with reference to the speed with which the latter kind of devotees reach him",

  "if thou art unable to practise even this abhyasa yoga, be thou intent on doing actions for my sake , even by doing actions for my sake, thou shalt attain perfection",
  "and if thou are not strong enough to practise concentration, then devote thyself to my service, do all thine acts for my sake, and thou shalt still attain the goal",
  "if you are incapable of doing a [steady] practice, then have, your chief aim, of performing actions for me.  even by performing actions for me, you shall attain success",

  "if you are unable even to practise, be intent on works for me. by undertaking works for me as well, you will attain perfection. [identity with brahman.]",
  "if you are incapable of practising remembrance in the above manner, then devote yourself to 'my deeds.' such devotional acts consist in the construction of temples, laying out temple gardens, lighting up lamps therein, sweeping, sprinkling water and plastering the floor of holy shrines, gathering flowers, engaging in my worship, chanting my names, circumambulating my temples, praising me, prostrating before me etc. do these with great affection. even performing such works which are exceedingly dear to me, you will, before long, get your mind steadily focused on me as through the practice of repetitions, and will gain perfection through attaining me",
  "abhyase'pi  etc.  the constant practice too becomes impossible due to the  predominance of the obstacles etc.  in that case, in order to eradicate them,  you should perform actions like worship, repetition  [of the lord's name etc.],  recitation [of scriptures], offering oblations, etc",

  "if thou art unable to do even this, then, resorting to union with me, renounce the fruits of all actions with the self controlled",
  "and if thou art too weak even for this, then seek refuge in union with me, and with perfect self-control renounce the fruit of thy action",
  "now, if you are not capable of doing this too, then taking resort to my yoga renounce the fruit of all action, with your self (mind) subdued",
  "if you are unable to do even this, i.e., taking refuge in my yoga, then, with your self controlled, renounce the fruits of every action",
  "if you are unable to do even this, in that case, having resorted to the yoga for me, thereafter renounce the results of all works by becoming controlled in mind",
  "if you are unable to do even this 'taking refuge in my yoga,' i.e., if you are unable even to do actions for my sake, which forms the sprout of bhakti yoga, wherein through meditation i am made the exclusive and sole object of love - then you should resort to aksara yoga described in the first six chapters. it consists in contemplation on the nature of the individual self. this engenders devotion to the lord. as a means for practice of this (aksara yoga), renounce the fruit of every action.  the state of mind that holds me as the only worthy object of attainment and love arises only when all the sins of an aspirant are destroyed without exception. 'one with a controlled mind' means one with the mind subdued. when the individual self is visualised to be of the nature of a sesa (subsidiary) to the lord, and when the veil of nescience consisting in identifying the self with the body is removed by contemplation on the self generated through the performance of works without attachment to the fruits and with my propitiation as the sole objective - then supreme bhakti to me will originate by itself. [the point driven home is this:  it is nescience that stands between the jiva and the lord. this nescience consists in identification of the self with the body. it is through works done without an eye on their fruits but exclusively as an offering to the lord, that this nescience is removed. thus karma yoga is the sprout of self-realisation, and of bhakti. on the nescience being removed, the knowledge that one (i.e., the jiva) is a sesa (an absolutely dependent liege) of the lord, dawns on the jiva. such knowledge generates exclusive devotion or bhakti accompanied by prapatti. or if the jiva gets immersed in its own bliss, it will attain kaivalya.]  in the same manner, sri krsna will further show in the text beginning with 'by worshipping him with his work will a man reach perfection' (18.46) and ending with 'forsaking the feeling of 'i' and with no feeling of 'mine' and tranil, one becomes worthy of the state of brahman. having realised the state of brahman, tranil, he neither grieves nor craves. regarding all beings alike, he attains supreme devotion to me' (18.53-54)",
  "atha etc.  in case due to ignorance, you do not know the method, enjoined in the scriptures and hence you are not able to perform actions for the lord, then renounce  (dedicate) all that to me, through offering your own self  [to me].  this is the intention  [here].  holding the same intention, i have myself declared in the laghuprakriya as :   'whatever action i have done, whether it is incomplete or superfluous,  not properly understood, bereft of a  proper order of precedence, devoid of  [good] care, and full of slip of intellect ,   o lord of all !  please, with mercy forgive all these of me, the afflicted and foolish devotee of yours , for you are compassionate ,   with this prayer-yoga,  i offer myself to you  [so that]  i do not become a receptacle of miseries again unnecessarily.'   the same idea may be observed in the scriptural texts of  the  siddhanta  [system] - that have the supreme lord as their subject matter - while they  speak of offering oneself  [to the lord].\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  the same purport is summed up -",
  "atha, if, again , asaktah asi, you are unable , kartum, to do , etat api, even this-what was stated as being 'intent on doing works for me' , in that case, mad-yogam-asritah, having resorted to the yoga for me-the performance of those works that are being done by dedicating them to me is madyogah , by resorting to that yoga for me , tatah, thereafter , sarva-karma-phala-tyagam kuru, renounce, give up, the results of all works , by becoming yata-atmavan, controlled in mind.

  "better indeed is knowledge than practice , than knowledge meditation is better , than meditation the renunciation of the fruits of actions: peace immediately follows renunciation",
  "knowledge is superior to blind action, meditation to mere knowledge, renunciation of the fruit of action to meditation, and where there is renunciation peace will follow",
  "for, knowledge is superior to practice , because of knowledge, meditation becomes pre-eminent , from meditation issues the renunciation of fruits of actions , and to renunciation, peace remains next",
  "far better is knowledge of the self then the repeated practice (of remembrance of the lord). better is meditation than this knowledge , better is renunciation of fruits of action than meditation. from such renunciation, peace ensues",
  "knowledge is surely superior to practice , meditation surpasses knowledge. the renunciation of the results of works (excels) meditation. from renunciation, peace follows immediately",
  "more than the practice of remembrance (of the lord), which is difficult in the absence of love for the lord, the direct knowledge of the self, arising from the contemplation of the imperishable self (aksara), is conducive to the well-being of the self. better than the imperfect knowledge of the self, is perfect meditation on the self, as it is more conducive to the well-being of the self. more conducive than imperfect meditation (i.e., meditation unaccompanied with renunciation), is the activity performed with renunciation of the fruits.  it is only after the annihilation of sins, through the performance of works accompanied by renounciation of fruits, that peace of mind is attained. when the mind is at peace, perfect meditation on the self is possible. from meditation results the direct realisation of the self. from the direct realisation of the self results supreme devotion. it is in this way that atmanistha or devotion to the individual self becomes useful for a person who is incapable of practising loving devotion to the supreme being. and for one practising the discipline for attaining the self (jnana yoga) without acisition of perfect tranillity of mind, disinterested activity (karma yoga), including in it meditation on the self, is the better path for the knowledge of the self. [thus the steps are performance of works without desire for fruits, eanimity of mind, meditation on the self, self-realisation, and devotion to the lord.]  now sri krsna enumerates the attributes reired of one intent on performance of disinterested activity:",
  "sreyah etc.   knowledge in the form of entering into  [the lord] is superior to practice ,  for practice bears that result.  due to the entering into the lord, the meditation i.e.,  getting  absorbed  in the bhagavat,  becomes pre-eminent i.e., attains superiority,  because of the achievement of what is desired.  when meditation i.e.,  getting absorbed in the bhagavat is accomplished, then it is possible to renounce  fruits of actions.  otherwise how can there be a renunciation in what is unknown ?  when renunciation of fruits of actions is achieved, there arises an uninterrupted peace.  therefore, being the root of all  [these], the knowledge a'one, in the form of fixing the mind in  the lord is important",
  "jnanam, knowledge , [firm conviction about the self arrived at through vedic texts and reasoning.] is hi, surely , sreyah, superior , -to what?-abhyasat, to practice [practice-repeated effort to ascertain the true meaning of vedic texts, in order to acire knowledge.] which is not preceded by discrimination. dhyanam, meditation, undertaken along with knowledge , visisyate, surpasses even jnanat, that knowledge. karma-phala-tyagah, renunciation of the results of works , excels even dhyanat, meditation associated with knowledge. ('excels' has to be supplied.) tyagat, from this renunciation of the results of actions, in the way described before , [by dedicating all actions to god with the idea, 'may god be pleased.'] santih, peace, the cessation of transmigratory existence together with its cause , follows anantaram, immediately , not that it awaits another accasion. should the unenlightened person engaged in works be unable to practise the disciplines enjoined earlier, then, for him has been enjoined renunciation of the results of all works as a means to liberation. but this has not been done at the very beginning. and for this reason renunciation of the results of all works has been praised in, 'knowledge is surely superior to practice,' etc. by teaching about the successive excellence. for it has been taught as being fit to be adopted by one in case he is unable to practise the disciplines already presented [presented from verse 3 onwards.] objection: from what similarly does the eulogy follow? reply: in the verse, 'when all desires clinging to one's heart fall off' (ka, 2.3.14), it has been stated that immortality results from the rejection of all desires. that is well known. and 'all desires' means the 'result of all rites and duties enjoined in the vedas and smrtis'. from the renunciation of these, peace surely comes immediately to the enlightened man who is steadfast in knowledge. there is a similarity between renunciation of all desires and renunciation of the results of actions by an unenlightened person. hence, on account of that similarity this eulogy of renunciation of the results of all actions is meant for rousing interest. as for instance, by saying that the sea was drunk up by the brahmana agastya, the brahmanas of the present day are also praised owing to the similarity of brahminhood. in this way it was been said that karma-yoga becomes a means for liberation,since it involves renunciaton of the rewards of works. here, again, the yoga consisting in the concentration of mind on god as the cosmic person, as also the performance of actions etc. for god, have been spoken of by assuming a difference between god and self. in, 'if you are unable to do even this' (11) since it has been hinted that it (karma-yoga) is an effect of ignorance, therefore the lord is pointing out that karma-yoga is not suitable for the meditator on the immutable, who is aware of idenity (of the self with god). the lord is similarly pointing out the impossibility of a karma-yogin's meditation on the immutable. in (the verse), 'they৷৷.attain me alone' (4), having declared that those who meditate on the immutable are independent so far as the attainment of liberation is concerned, the lord has shown in, '৷৷.i become the deliverer' (7), that others have no independence , they are dependent on god. for, if they (the former) be considered to have become identified with god, they would be the same as the immutable on account of (their) having realized non-difference. conseently, speaking of them as objects of the act of deliverance will become inappropriate! and, since the lord in surely the greatest well-wisher of arjuna, he imparts instructions only about karma-yoga, which involves perception of duality and is not associated with full illumination. also, no one who has realized his self as god through valid means of knowledge would like subordination to another, since it involves a contradiction. therefore, with the idea, 'i shall speak of the group of virtues (as stated in), 'he hwo is not hateful towards any creature,' etc. which are the direct means to immortality, to those monks who meditate on the immutable,who are steadfast in full enlightenment and have given up all desires,' the lord proceeds:",

  "i shall declare that nature of the individual self (brahman) which is the object to be known, namely, what is to be gained by means of virtues like modesty etc., by knowing which one attains to the self which is immortal, birthless, free from old age, death and such other material alities. [the expression is split up as - anadi = beginningless , mat-param = having me as the highest.] anadi means that which is beginningless. indeed, there is no origination for this individual self (brahman) and for the same reason, it is endless. the sruti also declares:  'the wise one is not born, nor dies' (ka. u., 2.18). 'matpara' means having me for the highest. verily, it has been told:  'know that which is other than this (lower nature), which is the life-principle, to be the highest prakrti of mine' (7.5). by virtue of being the body of the lord, the nature of the self finds joy in being completely subsidiary to him. so the sruti declares:  'he who, dwelling in the self, is within the self, whom the self does not know, whose body the self is and who controls the self from within ৷৷.' (br. u. madh., 5.7.22). similarly do the texts declare:  'he is the cause, lord of lords and of sense organs. he has no progenitor, nor lord' (sve. u., 6.9) , and 'he is the lord of the pradhana and of the individual selves, and the lord of alities (ibid., 6.16).  that which is conjoined with the ality of infinite dimension or extensiveness can be designated as brahman. it is different from, and not circumscribable by, the body etc. the meaning is, it is the principle which apprehends the ksetra. sruti also declares:  'he (i.e., the individual self) partakes of infinity' (sve. u., 5.9). by its karma it is circumscribed. it assumes its infinite nature only when it is freed from the bonds of karma. the term brahman is applied to designate the individual self as in:  'he, crossing beyond the gunas', becomes fit for the sake of brahman' (14.26), 'i am the ground of the brahman, who is immutable and immortal' (14.27), and 'having attained to the state of brahman, tranil, he neither grieves nor craves , regarding all beings alike, he attains supreme devotion to me' (18.54).  it (brahman) is said to be neither being nor non-being. the terms 'being' and 'non-being' cannot signify the nature of the self because it is neither effect nor cause. for it is called 'being' (sat) in the condition of effect when it has the form of gods etc. as it cannot possess names and forms in the condition of cause, it is said to be 'non-being' or asat. so the sruti texts declare:  'in the beginning, verily, this (brahman) was non-existence , therefrom the being was born' (tai. u., 2.7.1) and 'verily, this (brahman) was then undifferntiated. it became differentiated by names and forms' (br. u., 1.4.7). the self's conditions as effect and cause have arisen on account of veiling by avidya or ignorant in the form of karma. it is not an expression of its real nature. so, the terms 'being' and 'non-being' do not signify the nature of the self, if it is argued that, in the passage 'in the beginning, verily, this (brahman) was non-existence' (tai. u., 2.7.1), it is the supreme brahman in the state of cause that is described - even then it can be pointed out that the supreme brahman in causal condition has, for his body, the conscient and non-conscient entities in a subtle state, incapable of being differentiated by names and forms. such a description is therefore valid. on the same principle the nature of ksetra (body) and ksetrajna (individual self) in the state of cause can also be indicated by the term 'non-being'. but this condition of the individual self has arisen due to karma and such descriptions as 'being' and 'non-being' are applicable to the self only in the state of bondage. its pure form cannot be signified by the terms 'being' and 'non-being'",
  "pravaksyami, i shall speak of, fully describe just as it is , tat, that , yat, which , is jenyam, to be known. in order to interest the hearer through inducement, the lord speaks of what its result is: jnatva, by realizing , yat, which knowable , asnute, one attains , amrtam, immortality, i.e. , he does not die again. anadimat, without beginning-one having a beginning (adi) is adimat , one not having a beginning is anadimat. what is that? the param, supreme, unsurpassable , brahma, brahman, which is under discussion as the knowable. here, some split up the phrase anadimatparam as anadi and matparam because, if the word anadimat is taken as a bahuvrihi compound, ['that which has no (a), beginning (adi) is anadi.' matup is used to denote possession. since the idea of possession is a already implied in anadi, therefore matup, if added after it, becomes redundant.] then the suffix mat (matup) becomes redundant, which is undesirable. and they show a distintive meaning: (brahman is anadi, beginningless, and is) matparam, that of which i am the supreme (para) power called vasudeva. trully, the redundance could be avoided in this way if that meanig were possible. but that meaning is not possible, because what is intended is to make brahman known only through a negation of all attributes by saying, 'it is called neither being nor non-being.' it is contradictory to show a possession of a distinctive power and to negate attributes. therefore, although matup and a bahuvrihi compound convey the same meaning of 'possession', its (matup's) use is for completing the verse. [the commentator accepts anadimat as a nan-tatpurusa compund. if, however, the bahuvrihi is insisted on, then the mat after anadi should be taken as completing the number of syllables needed for versification. so, nat need not be compounded with param.] having aroused an interest through inducement by saying, 'the knowable which has immortality as its result is beeing spoken of by me,' the lord says: tat, that knowable , ucyate, is called , na sat, neither being , nor is it called asat, non-being. objection: after strongly girding up the loins and declaring with a loud voice, 'i shall speak of the knowable,' is it not incongruous to say, 'that is called neither being nor non-being'? reply: no. what has been said is surely consistent.  objection: how? reply: for in all the upanisads, the knowable, i.e. brahman, has been indicated only by negation of all attributes-'not this, not this' (br. 4.4.22), 'not gross, not subtle' (op. cit. 3.3.8), etc. , but not as 'that is this', for it is beyond speech. objection: is it not that a thing which cannot be expressed by the word 'being' does not exist? like-wise, if the knowable cannot be expressed by the word 'being', it does not exist. and it is contradictory to say, 'it is the knowable', and 'it cannot be expressed by the word 'being'.' counter-objection: as to that, no that it does not exist, because it is not the object of the idea, 'it is non-being.' objection: do not all cognitions verily involve the idea of being or non-being? this being so, the knowable should either be an object of a cognition involving the idea of existence, or it should be an object of a cognition involving the idea of non-existence. reply: no, because, by virtue of its being super-sensuous, it is not an object of cognition involving either, of the two ideas. indeed, any object perceivable by the senses, such as pot etc., can be either an object of cognition involving the idea of existence, or it can be an object of cognition involving the idea of non-existence. but this knowable, being supersensuous and known from the scriptures, which are the sole means of (its) knowledge, is not, like pot etc., an object of cognition involving either of the two ideas. therefore it is called neither being nor non-being. as for your objection that it is contradictory to say, 'it is the knowable, but it is neither called being nor non-being,'-it is not contradictory , for the upanisad says, 'that (brahman) is surely different from the known and, again, it is above the unknown' (ke. 1.4). objection: may it not be that even the upanisad is contradictory in its meaning? may it not be (contradictory) as it is when, after beginning with the topic of a shed for a sacrifice, [cf. 'pracinavamsam karoti, he constructs (i.e. shall construct) (the sacrificial shed) with its supporting beam turned east-ward' (tai, sam. , also see sanskrit-english dictionary, monier williams).-tr.] it is said, 'who indeed knows whether there exists anything in the other world or not!' (tai. sam. 6.1.1)? reply: no, since the upanisad speaking of something that is different from the known and the unknown is meant for establishing an entity that must be realized. [the upanisadic text is not to be rejected on the ground that it is paradoxical, for it is meant to present brahman as indentical with one's own inmost self.] but, '৷৷.whether there exists anything in the other world,' etc. is merely an arthavada [see note on p. 40. here, the passage, '৷৷.whether there exists৷৷.,' etc. is to be interpreted as an arthavada emphasizing, the need of raising a shed, irrespective of any other consideration.-tr.] connected with an injunction. from reason who it follows that brahman cannot be expressed by such words as being, non-being, etc. for, every word used for expressing an object, when heard by listeners, makes them understand its meaning through the comprehension of its significance with the help of genus, action, ality and relation , not in any other way, because that is not a matter of experience. to illustrate this: a cow, or a horse, etc. (is comprehended) through genus , cooking or reading, through action , white or black, through ality , a rich person or an owner of cows, through relation. but brahman does not belong to any genus. hence it is not expressible by words like 'being' etc. , neither is it possessed of any alitity with the help of which it could be expressed through alifying words, for it is free from alities , nor can it be expressed by a word implying action, it being free from actions-which accords with the upanisadic text, 'partless, actionless, calm' (sv. 6.19). nor has it any relation, since it is one, non-dual, not an object of the senses, and it is the self. therefore it is logical that it cannot be expressed by any word. and this follows from such upanisadic texts as, 'from which, words trun back' (tai. 2.4.1), etc. therefore it is logical that it cannot be expressed by any word. and this follows from such upanisadic texts as, 'from which, words turn back' (tai. 2.4.1), etc. since the knowable (brahman) is not an object of the word or thought of 'being', there arises the apprehension of its nonexistence. hence, for dispelling that apprehension by establishing its existence with the help of the adjuncts in the form of the organs of all creatures, the lord says:",

(sve. u., 3.19). it may be said that it means that the supreme brahman performs everywhere the task of hands, feet etc., even though he is devoid of hands and feet. if 'brahman' is taken to mean the self, it can be asked how this power of the supreme brahman (namely, having hand, feet, eyes, etc., everywhere) can be attributed to the self, then the answer is that it is established in the srutis that the pure individual self has the capacity of performing the task of hands, feet etc., because it is eal to him. sruti also declares:  'then, the wise seer, shaking off good and evil, stainless, attains the supreme eality with him' (mun. u., 3.1.3). sri krsna will also teach later on:  'resorting to this knowledge, it partakes of my nature' (14.2). it exists encompassing all things, whatever aggregate of things that exist in the world , it encompasses them. the sense is that in its pure state, it is all-pervasive, as it has no limitation of space etc",

  "the body which is cognised in identity with the experiencing self by co-ordinate predication (samanadhikaranya) in the propositions, 'i am a god, 'i am a man,' 'i am fat,' 'i am slender' etc., is described by those who know the real nature of the body as only the field (ksetra) of experience for the experiencing self, who is distinct from the body. those who know this, namely, those who know the exact nature of the self, call it the field-knower (ksetrajna). that knower who knows the body, as divided into its different members and as their collectivity, can say 'i know it, the body, as an object.' the person with this perception is the one who is called the ksetrajna or the field-knower, who must necessarily be different from the field (ksetra), which is the object of this knowledge.  it is true that at the time of perceiving an object like a pot which is different from one's body, the seer who thinks 'i am a god who sees it' or 'i am a man who sees it' etc., is putting himself as identical with the body through co-ordinate predication. in the same way he experiences the body as an object of knowledge when he says 'i know this body.' thus if the body is an object of knowledge, it must be different from the knowing self. therefore, the field-knower (ksetrajna). the knower, is other than the body which is an object of knowledge like a jar, etc.  but this knowledge which arises by way of co-ordinate predication is justified on the ground that the body is inseparable from oneself , for it constitutes an attribute of the self like 'cow-ness' of the cow etc. the knowing self is however unie in being an eternal and subtle form of knowledge. but this is inaccessible to the ordinary man's organs of vision , it is accessible only to a mind refined by yoga. the ignorant see the knower only in the form of prakrti because of close proximity to or union with prakrti. sri krsna thus declares later on:  'when in identiciation with the gunas he departs or stays or experiences, the deluded perceive him not. they, who have the eye of knowledge, see' (15.10)",
  "the lord specifies the body as the object referred to by the pronoun idam (this). o son of kunti, (this body) abhidhiyate, is referred to , ksetram iti, as the field-because it is protected (tra) against injury (ksata), or because it perishes (ksi), wastes away (ksar), or because the results of actions get fulfilled in the body as in a field (ksetra). the word iti is used in the sense of 'as'. they-who?-tadvidah, who are versed in this, who know the 'field' and the 'knower of the field' , ahuh, call , tam, him, the knower , yah, who , vetti etat, is concious of, knows, it, the body, the field-makes it, from head to foot, an abject of his knowledge , makes it an object of perception as a separate entity, through knowledg which is spontaneous or is acired through instruction , ksetrajna iti, as the knower of the field. as before, the word iti is used in the sense of 'as'. they call him as the knower of the field. is it that the field and the knower of the field thus mentioned are to be understood through this much knowledge only? the answer is, no",

  "viddhi, know , ubhau, both , prakrtim nature , and also the purusam, individual soul ,-these two , nature and the soul. the aspects of god-to be api, verily , anadi, without beginning. those two that have no beginning (adi), are anadi. since the godhood of god is eternal, therefore it is logical that even his aspects also should have eternality. for god's god-hood consists verily in having the two aspects. those two aspects through which god becomes the cause of creation, continuance and dissolution of the universe, and which are beginningless, are the sources of mundane existence. some interpret the phrase anadi in the tatpurusa [tatpurusa: name of a class of compounds in which the first member determines the sense of the other members, or in which the last member is defined or alified by the first, without losing its original independence.-v.s.a.] sense of na adi, not primeval (not cause). (according to them) thery indeed is established the causality of god. again, if nature and soul themselves be eternal, the mundane existence would surely be their creation, and the causality of the mundane existence would not be god's. that is wrong because, there being nothing to rule over before the emergence of nature and soul, there will arise the contingency of god ceasing to be god! and if the mundane state be uncaused [uncaused, i.e. not caused by nature and soul, but by god independently of those two aspects.] there arises the contingency of the absence of liberation, [if god were. himself the sole cause of mundane existence, independently of his two aspects, then it would be endless because there would be nothing to prevent liberated souls from being put under bondage again.] the scriptures becoming useless, and the absence of bondage and freedom. on the other hand, all these become justifiable if god and the two aspects be eternal. how? viddhi, know , the vikaran, modifications that will be spoken of-the intellect etc., the body and the organs , ca eva, as also , gunan, the alities (sattva etc.)-manifest in the form of the mental states of happiness, sorrow and attachment , as prakriti-sambhavan, born of nature. nature, maya, is the power of god, which is the cause of the modifications and which consists of the three alities. those modifications and alities, which have that nature as their source,-know those modifications and alities as 'born of nature', as transformations of nature. which again, are those modifications and alities born of nature?",
  "in the production of the effect and the cause, nature (matter) is said to be the cause , in the experience of pleasure and pain, the soul is said to be the cause",

  "the 'karya' means the body, the 'karanas' mean the instruments, i.e., the senses of perception and action plus the manas. in their operations, the prakrti, subservient to the self, is alone the causal factor. the sense is that their operations, which are the means of experience, have their foundation in the prakrti, which has developed in the form of the body subservient to the self. in regard to this, the authority is the aphorism, 'the self is an agent, on account of the scriptures having the purpose' (b. s., 2.3.33) etc. the agency of the self means that the self is the cause of the will (effort) to support the body. the self (purusa) associated with the body is the cause for experiencing pleasures and pains. the meaning is that it is the seat of those experiences.  thus, has been explained the difference in the operations of the prakrti and of the self when they are mutually conjoined. he now proceeds to explain how, though the self, which in its pristine nature experiences itself by itself as nothing but joy, becomes the cause of experiencing both pleasure and pain derived from sense objects when it is conjoined with a body.  the term guna figuratively represents effects. the self (in its pristine nature) experiences itself by itself, as nothing buy joy. but when dwelling in the body, i.e., when it is in conjunction with the prakrti, it experiences the alities born of prakrti, namely, happiness, pain etc., which are the effects of gunas like sattva etc.  he explains the cause of conjunction with the prakrti:",
  "karya-karana-kartrtve, with regard to the source of body and organs: karya is the body, and karana are the thirteen [five sense organs, five motor organs, mind, intellect and ego.] organs existing in it. here, by the word karya are understood the aforesaid elements that produce the body as also the objects which are modifications born of nature. and since the alities-which are born of nature and manifest themselves as happiness, sorrow and delusion-are dependent on the organs, (therefore) they are implied by the word karana, organs. the kartrtvam, (lit) agentship, with regard to these body and organs consists in being the source of the body and organs. with regard to this source of the body and organs, prakrtih, nature , ucyate, is said to be , the hetuh, cause, in the sense of being the originator. thus, by virtue of being the source of body and organs, nature is the cause of mundane existence. even if the reading be karya-karana-kartrtva, karya (effect, modification) will mean anything that is the transformation of something , and karana (cause) will be that which becomes transformed. so the meaning of the compund will be: 'with regard to the source of the effect and the cause'. or, karya means the sixteen [the eleven organs (five sensory, five motor, and mind) and the five objects (sound etc.).] modificaitons, and karana means the seven [mahat, egoism, and the five subtle elements.] transformations of nature. they themselves are called effect and cuase. so far as the agentship with regard to these is concerned nature is said to be the cause, because of the same reason of being their originator. as to how the soul can be the cause of mundane existence is being stated: purusah, the soul, the empirical being, the knower of the field-all these are synonymous , is the hetuh, cause , bhoktrtve, so far as enjoyership, the fact of being the perceiver , sukha-duhkhanam, of happiness and sorrow-which are objects of experience, is concerned. how, again, is it asserted with respect to nature and soul that, they are the causes of mundane existence by virtue of this fact of their (respectively) being the source of body and organs, and the perceiver of happiness and sorrow? as to this the answer is being stated: how can there be any mundane existence if there be no modification of nature in the form of body and organs, happiness and sorrow, and cause and effect, and there be no soul, the conscious being, to experience them? on the other hand, there can be mundane existence when there is a contact, in the form of ignorance, between nature-modified in the form of body and organs, and cause and effect as an object of experience and the soul opposed to it as the experiencer. therefore it was reasonable to have said that, nature and soul become the cause of mundane existence by (respectively) becoming the originators of the body and organs, and the perceiver of happiness and sorrow. what again is this that is called worldly existence? worldly existence consists in the experience of happiness and sorrow , and the state of mundane existence of the soul consists in its being the experiencer of happiness and sorrow. it has been asserted that the state of mundane existence of the soul consists in its being the experiencer of happiness and sorrow. how does it come about? this is being answered:",

  "sah yah, he who , vetti, knows, in the manner described , the purusam, person, that self possessed of the characteristics stated above, as 'i myself (am that)' , and knows prakrtim, nature as described above, which is characterized as ignorance , to have been eradicated by knowledge, saha, along with , gunaih, the alities which are its modifications , na abhijayate, will not be born , bhuyah, again-after the fall of this body of the man of realization, he does not become born again for (taking) another body, i.e. he does not take up another body , sarvatha api, in whatever way , vartamanah, he may live. from the word api it is understood that, it goes without saying that one who is firm in his own duty is not rorn. objection: though it has been said that there is absence of rirth after the dawn of knowledge, still is not illogical that actions done (in the present life) before the rise of knowledge and those done subseently, as also those done in the many past lives, should be destroyed without yielding their results? hence there should be three births! for destruction of acired merit is not logical, to the same extent as actions that have produced the present birth and are yielding their proper results (cannot be destroyed). besides, it is not understood that actions have distinctions [since all actions arise from ignorance, they are on the same level so far so they are opposed to knowledge , i.e., there can be no such distinction among actions as 'those which have started yielding results' and 'those that have not'.]. therefore, the actions of the three kinds, without exception, will produce three births or they all collectively will produce one birth. otherwise, if the acired merits become destroyed, it will lead to loss of faith everywhere as well as to the purposelessness of scriptures. therefore it has been illogical to say, 'he will not be born again.' reply: no, for the burning away of all the actions of the man of knowledge has been stated in hundreds of upanisadic texts such as: 'and all one's actions become dissipated' (mu. 2.2.8) , 'anyone who knows (that supreme) brahman, becomes brahman' (op. cit. 3.2.9) , 'for him the delay is for so long only (as he does not become freed)' (ch. 6.14.2) ,  'as the fibres at the tip of a blade of reed (become completely burnt৷৷.,' so) all actions 'get completely burnt' (op. cit. 5.24.3). here too the burning of all actions has been stated in, 'as a blazing fire reduces pieces of wood to ashes,৷৷.'etc. (4.37), and he will also say so (later) [see 18.66: 'i shall free you from all sins,' etc.-tr.]. this accords with reason also. verily, actions, which arise from the seed of evils [klesas, evils-see note under 8.19-tr.] like ignorance and desires, germinate the sprout of rirth. here also it has been said by the lord in various places that actions which are associated with egoism and desire for results bear fruits, not the others. and there is also the verse: 'as seeds burnt by fire do not germinate, so also the self does not acire another body due to evils that have been burnt by knowledge (cf. mbh. va. 199. 107). objection: it may be granted for the present that actions performed after the rise of knowledge are burnt by knowledge, since they coexist with knowledge. but the burning away of actions done in this life prior to the rise of knowledge and those done in the many past lives is not reasonable. reply: no, because of the alification, 'all actions' (4.37). objection: may it not be that 'all actions' means those that are undertaken after illumination? reply: no, for there is no reason for the restriction (of the meaning). on the other hand, as for the statement, 'just as actions that have produced the present birth and are already active in producing their results do not get dissipated even after illumination, similarly it is not reasonable that actions which have not commenced producing their results should get dissipated,'-that is wrong. objection: why? reply: since they have already begun producing results, like an arrow that has been shot: as an arrow, freed earlier from a bow for hitting a target, even after piercing through the target comes to a stop only after falling down as a result of the dissipation of its initial momentum, similarly, actions that produced the (present) body verily continue, even after fulfilling the purpose of maintaining the body, to exist as before until the dissipation of their inherent tendencies. but, as that very arrow, when it has not acired the momentum, needed for action, when it has not been shot even though fixed on the bow, can be withdrawn, similarly, actions which have not begun yielding their results may be rendered unproductive by knowledge, even while existing in their receptacle. [the internal organ bearing the reflection of consciousness.] hence, it is established that , it has been reasonable to state that on the fall of the present body of an enlightened person, 'he is not born again.' here are being presented these meditation etc. which are the alternative means for the realization of the self:",

  "dhyanena, through meditation: meditation means contemplation (on the self) after withdrawing into the mind with concentration the organs of hearing etc. from the objects like sound etc., and then withdrawing the mind into the indwelling conscious self. thus, from the citation of such illustrations as, 'the crane meditates, as it were, 'the earth meditates, as it were , the mountains meditate, as it were' (ch. 7.6.1), it follows that meditation is a constant and uninterrupted current of thought like a line of pouring oil. through that meditation, kecit, some yogis , pasyanti, realize , the indwelling conscious atmanam, self , atmani, in (their) intellect , atmana, with the help of the internal organ that has been purified by meditation. anye, others , sankhyena yogena, through sankhya-yoga: sankhya means thinking, 'these alities, viz sattva, rajas and tamas, are objects of my perception , i am the self, distinct from them, a witness of their functions, eternal and different from the alities.' this sankhya is yoga. [by sankhya is meant that knowledge which arises from the foregoing reflection. this knowledge is itself called yoga (concentration of mind) inasmuch as it is similar to yoga in leading to the realization of the self.] through that they realize the self with the help of the internal organ. this is how it is to be construed. and anye, others , karma-yogena, through karma-yoga-action itself being the yoga: action performed with the idea of dedication to god is figuratively called yoga since it leads to yoga.

  "know as myself the field-knower also who is the only form of the knower in all the bodies like divinities, men etc., i.e., know them as ensouled by me. by the expression 'also' (api) in, 'know me also (api) as the field-knower,' it is inferable that 'know me as the field-knower in all fields' has also been taught by implication. just as the body, on account of its being the attribute of the knower, cannot exist separately, and is conseently denoted by way of co-ordinate predication (samanadhikarnya) with it, in the same manner both the field and the field-knower, on account of their being my attributes, cannot exist as entities separate from me, and hence can be denoted as 'one with me' by way of co-ordinate predication.  both the ksetra (field) which is an aggregate of earth etc., and the ksetrajna (the jiva) have the lord for their self, because of their being of the nature of the body of the lord. such is the teaching of the sruti passages beginning from 'he who dwelling in the earth, is within the earth, whom the earth does not know, whose body is the earth, who controls the earth from within - he is your inner controller and immortal self' (br. u., 3.7.3), and ending with 'he who, dwelling in the individual self as the self within, whom the self does not know, whose body the self is, who controls the self from within - he is your inner controller and immortal self' (br. u. madh., 3.7.22). it is the dwelling in of the lord as the self of all the knowers of the bodies (field-knowers or the jivas) on account of his being the inner controller, that is the justification for describing him as in co-ordinate predication (samanadhikaranya) with them.  in the beginning and later on, it was taught to the effect, 'i am the self, o arjuna, dwelling in the hearts of all beings' (10.20), and 'nothing that moves or does not move exists without me' (10.39) and 'i, with a single aspect of myself, am sustaining the whole universe' (10.42). in the middle he describes himself by way of co-ordinate predication as, 'of adityas, i am visnu' etc. in the teachings concerning the difference between the body and its knower and concerning both of them as having me for their self - this knowledge of unity by co-ordinate predication alone is taught as 'my view.'  some (the followers of advaita and bhedabheda) say:  the sentence 'and know me as the knower' should be understood as co-ordinate predication expressing identity between the individual self and the supreme self. thus according to their view, the lord (isvara), who is existence-knowledge-bliss absolute must be admitted to have become the individual self, as it were, through nescience (ajnana). according to their docrine the teaching of identity given here in the text seeks to sublate that nescience. just as teaching by a reliable person to the effect, 'this is a rope, and not a snake,' sublates the erroneous notion of a snake, the teaching of the lord, who is most reliable, sublates the erroneous notion of the individual self (ksetrjna) being different from him.  such interpreters are to be estioned thus:  is this teacher, bhagavan vasudeva, the supreme ruler, one whose nescience has been sublated by the exact knowledge of the self or not?  if his nescience has been sublated, then the perception of duality like arjuna as the taught, and of actions like teaching, becomes impossible, because of the impossibility of superimposing a flase form on the self which is in reality mere undifferentiated consciousness. if, however, his nescience has not been sublated on account of his not having realised the self, then, because of his ignorance, it is utterly impossible for him to teach the knowledge of the self. elsewhere it has been stated:  'the wise, who have realised the truth, will instruct you in knowledge' (4.34). thus, the polemics of this nature are to be ignored as having been set forth to misguide the world by these ignorant daters whose arguments are contradicted by all vedas, smrtis, itihasas, the puranas, logic and their own words.  the truth is this:  some of the sruti texts declare that non-conscient matter, the conscient entity (the individual self) and the supreme brahman are different in nature from one another in the relation of object of enjoyment, the enjoyer (subject) and the supreme ruler as follows:  'from prakrti, the possessor of maya projects this world, in which another (i.e. the individual self) is confined by maya (sve. u., 4.9) , 'know then maya to be the prakrti and the possessor of maya to be the great lord' (sve. u., 4.10) , 'the perishable is prakrti , the immortal and imperishable is hara (the individual self) , and the lord alone rules over both the perishable prakrti and the imperishable individual self' (sve. u., 1.10). here, the expression, 'the immortal and the imperishable is hara,' points out the enjoyer (i.e., individual self) , it is called hara because the individual self siezes matter as an object of it own experience.  again, 'he is the cause, the lord of the lord of senses' (ibid., 6.9) , 'he has no progenitor and no lord' (ibid., 6.9) , 'he is the ruler of prakrti, of the individual self, and the lord of alities' (ibid., 6.16) , 'he is the lord of the universe, the ruler of individual selves, the eternal, the auspicious and the unchanging' (ma. na., 13.3) , 'the two unborn - the knowing lord and the unknowing individual self, the omnipotent and the impotent' (sve. u.,1.9) , 'the constant among inconstants, the intelligent among the intelligents, the one who grants the desires of the many' (ibid., 6.13. & ka. u., 5.13) , 'when one knows the enjoyer, the object of enjoyment and actuater ৷৷.' (sve. u., 1.12) , 'regarding the individual self and the actuater to be different, and blessed by him, it attains immortality' (ibid., 1.6), and 'ot these two, the one eats the sweet pippala fruit, the other shines in his splendour without eating' (ibid., 4.6 and mun. u., 3.1.1).  further, 'there is one unborn female, red, white and black, who produces many creatures like herself , there is another unborn being who loves her and is close to her , there is yet another male unborn who after having enjoyed here, gives her up' (ibid., 4.5) , 'the cow (i.e. prakrti) that has no beginning or end, is the mother and source of all beings' (cha. u., 4.5) and 'on the self-same tree, the individual self sits sunken in grief, and being ignorant and impotent, it grieves. when it sees the other, the gracious lord and his glory, it attains freedom from grief (sve. u., 4.7).  the following passages of the gita are alos to the point:  'this prakrti, thus divided eightfold, composed of ahankara etc., is mine.' 'this is my lower prakrti. know my higher prakrti to be distinct from this - the life principle, by which the universe is sustained (7.4-5) , 'all beings, o arjuna, enter into my nature at the end of a cycle. these i send forth again at the beginning of a cycle. resorting to prakrti, which is my own, i send forth again and again all this multitude of beings, helpless under the sway of prakrti' (9.7-8) , 'under my control, prakrti gives birth to all that moves, and that which does not move. and because of this, o arjuna, does the world spin' (9.10) , 'know that prakrti and the individual self are without beginning' (13.19) 'the great brahman (or prakrti) is my womb , in that i lay the germ , from it, o arjuna, is the birth of all beings' (14.3). the great brahman of mine, which is the womb of this world, called prakti, non-conscient matter, consisting of elements in a subtle state - in it i lay the germ called conscient entity. from that, namely, from the compound between conscient and unconscient entities, which is willed by me, are born all these beings beginning with the gods and ending with the immobile things mixed up with the unconscient matter. such is the meaning. in the sruti also, the subtle original state of material elements is signified as brahman:  'from him are produced brahman as also the world of matter and soul (anna) having name and form' (mun. u., 1.1.9).  likewise, sruti texts declare that the supreme person constitutes the self of all, and the conscient and non-conscient entities are inseparable from him , for, those conscient and unconscient entities, which abide in the form of the experiencer and the experienced abiding in all states, form the body of the supreme person , conseently they are under his control. these texts are as follows:  'he who, dwelling in the earth, is within the earth, whom the earth does not know, whose body the earth is, who is the inner ruler of the earth' and ending with, 'he who, dwelling in the self, is within the self, whom the self does not know, whose body the self is and who is the inner controller of the self' (br. u. madh., 3.7.3-22). likewise another passage declares:  'he who is moving withing the earth, to whom the earth is the body, whom the earth does not know ৷৷. he who is moving within the mrtyu (nature), to whom mrtyu is the body, whom mrtyu does not know ৷৷. he is the inner self of all beings, sinless , he is the divine lord, he is of the one narayana' (sub. u., 7). here the term mrtyu denotes the subtle state of non-conscient entity which is expressed by the term tamas, because in the same upanisad, it is declared, 'the unmanifest (avyakta) merges into aksara (the imperishable), and the aksara merges into tamas (ibid., 2). elsewhere it is stated thus:  'entering within, is the ruler of all creatures, the self of all (tai. a., 3.21).  therefore, the supreme person, who posseses conscient and non-conscient entities abiding in all states as his body, is in the form of the world, whether in the state of cause or of effect. so, with the purpose of making this explicit, some srutis declare that the world in its states as cause and effect, is he himself. they begin with, 'this existence (sat) alone was in the beginning, one only without a second ৷৷. it thought, 'may i become many, may i multiply'. it creates tejas' (cha. u., 6.2.1.2), and ends with 'all creatures here, my dear, have their root in the sat (being), have their home in the sat, have sat as their support. all this has sat for its self. that is existence. he is the self. that you are, o svetaketu' (cha. u., 6.8.4.6-7). elsewhere is the following text beginning with, 'he desired, 'may i become many' , he performed austerity , having performed austerity, he created all this,' and concluding with, 'he became both the satya (individual self) and anrta (matter), he has remained true to his nature' (tai. u., 2.6.1).  the difference in nature between conscient and unconscient entities and the supreme person, established in the other sruti passages, is asserted here also:  'lo! entering into these three divinities (i.e. the tejas, water and earth) in the form of living self (individual self), which is myself, i distinguish name and form?  (cha. u., 6.3.2) and also in the text, 'having created it, he entered into it. having entered it, he became sat and tyat ৷৷. he became both conscious and unconscious, both the satya (individual self) and anrta (matter). he has remained true to his own nature' (tai. u., 2.6.1). it is in this way that all the distinctions of names and forms are brought about:  the sruti also declares, 'then, this was undifferentiated. now, it has been differentiated by names and forms' (br. u., 1.4.7).  therefore, he who exists in the states of effect and cause, and who has the conscient and unconscient entities in their gross and subtle states as his body, is the supreme person. because the effect is not other than the cause, the effect becomes known when the cause is known, when the one becomes known, everything is known - thus what is posited by the srutis stands explained. in the text, 'entering into these three divinities by way of living self (individual self) which is my self, i distinguish name and form' (cha. u., 6.3.2) - all the non-conscient entities are pointed out by the expression, 'the three divinities', and then the distinguishing of names and forms arises on account of the individual selves having him for their self, entering into those entities. thus all expressive terms signify the supreme self who is alified by the individual selves and non-conscient matter. therefore, co-ordinate predication (samanadhikaranya) of a term denoting an effect with a term denoting the supreme self as cause, is ite appropriate.  thus the supreme brahman, who has conscient and non-conscient entities in their gross and subtle conditions as his modes, is himself the effect and the cause , so brahman is the material cause of the world. brahman himself constitutes the material cause of the world, because brahman, who has the conscient and unconscient entities in their subtle state as his body, forms the cause of all. still as that material cause is a composite entity (i.e., of individual selves, prakrti aand isvara), there is no mixing up of the natures of brahman, conscient entities and non-conscient entities. this is perfectly tenable.  thus, for example, although the material cause of a multi-coloured cloth is a combination of white, black and red threads, the connection of whiteness etc., with the cloth is to be found only in the place where a particular kind of thread is woven in it , in the state of effect also, there is no mixing up of the colours everywhere. similarly, although the world has for its material cause a combination of the lord, conscient and non-conscient entities, still in its condition as an effect also, there is no mixing up of the respective alities of experiencer (subject), the experienced (object) and the controller (god). though these threads can exist separately they are brought together at a time by man's will and acire the character and effect as a conseence. but in the case of the world manifestation, there is a unieness. it consists in that the intelligent and insentient entities in both causal and effect conditions derive their existential nature only from, and as, modes of the supreme person, by forming his body. thus the supreme person having those entities as his body, is always signified by all these terms indicating them. as for the differences in nature, their respective speciality of character holds good here (i.e., in the production of world as of the coloured cloth).  such being the case, though the supreme brahman enters the effect, owing to absence of transformation of his nature, the unchangeability is well established. to signify brahman as effect is also very appropriate, because he is the self sustaining the conscient and non-conscient entities from within their gross condition when they are differentiated by name and form:  what is called effect is nothing other than the cause passing into another state of existence.  the various scriptural statements that the supreme brahman is without attributes are also tenable in the sense that he is not associated with evil attributes, as the sruti text, 'he is free from evil, ageless, deathless, sorrowless, hungerless, thirstless' eliminates all evil attributes, and then says that he is full of auspicious attributes:  'whose desire is real, whose will is real' (cha. u., 8.7.1). this sruti text itself settles here what was generally declared elsewhere that negation of attributes (guna-nisedha) pertains to evil attributes in brahman.  the doctrine that brahman is of the nature of knowledge is also ite appropriate, because it amounts to saying that the true nature of brahman, who is omniscient and omnipotent, who is antagonistic to all that is evil, and who is the mine of all auspicious attributes, can be adeately defined only as knowledge, as one whose nature is knowledge, since he possesses self-luminosity. the following texts teach that brahman is the knower:  'he who is all-knowing, all wise' (mun. u., 1.1.9) , 'his high power is revealed, indeed, as various and natural, as consisting of knowledge, strength and activity' (sve.u., 6.8) , 'my dear, by what means has one to understand the knower?'  (br. u., 2.4.14) , and the text, 'brahman is existence, knowledge and infinity' (tai. u., 2.1.1). all these teach that brahman is of the nature of knowledge in as much as he can be defined only as knowledge, and because also he is self-luminous.  in the texts 'he desired, 'may i become many' ' (tai. u., 2.6.1), 'it thought, 'may i become many' ' (cha. u., 6.2.3), 'it became differentiated by names and forms' - it is affirmed that brahman thus exists of his own will in a wonderful plurality of modes on account of his having the immovable and movable entities as his body. conseently it is false to affirm the opposite view that the manifold entities do not have brahman as their self in a real sense.  thus, it is the unreality of manifold existence (i.e., of entities without brahman for the self) that is denied in the following texts:  'he obtains death after death who sees difference here' (ka. u., 2.4.10), 'there is nothing here that is manifold' (ka. u., 2.4.11), 'but where there is duality, as it were, there one sees another ৷৷. but where everything has become the self ৷৷. there, by what can one see what ৷৷. who shall know which by what?'  (br. u., 4.5.15). there is also no denial of the manifoldness of modes of the brahman resulting from his assumption of various names and forms by his will. this is established in sruti texts such as, 'may i become manifold' (tai. u., 2.6.1 and cha. u., 6.2.3) etc. this manifold modality is proved to be existent in the commencement of even that passage which negates multiplicity by asserting. 'but where everything has become the self' (br. u., 4.5.15). 'everything deserts him who knows everything to be apart from him' (br. u., 4.5.7), and 'lo, verily, from this great being has been breathed forth that which is rg veda' (ibid., 2.4.10).  thus there is no contradiction whatsoever among the srutis which assert difference in essence and in nature between the conscient self, non-conscient matter and the lord, whose body the former entities are. there is no contradiction also in the scriptural statement that they are identical. the relation of the body and the self exists at all times between the lord and the conscient and non-conscient entities. the sruti texts themselves establish that those entities, which constitute the body (of the lord), acire in causal condition, a subtle state, in which they cannot be differentiated. in the effect condition they are in a gross state with names and forms, and are capable of differentiation into a multiplicity of entities as modes of the supreme.  thus there is no room whatsoever for entertaining such doctrines which ascribe nescience to brahman (as in advaita), for describing the differences in brahman as due to limiting adjuncts (as in bhedabheda) and other tenets (yadavaprakasa's). all these proceed from unsound logic and are in viloation of all srutis. let this over-long polemic be terminated here.  the object of this long polemical passage is to refute the advaitic interpretation of the statement know the field-knower in all bodies as myself' as one of absolute identity between the jiva and isvara. the thesis of the author of the commentary is that the relation is not oneof absolute identity but only one of identity of reference of several inseparable entities to a comon substratum known technically as samandadhikaranya or co-ordinate predication, also translated sometimes as grammatical co-ordination. the literal meaning of the expression is 'the relation of abiding in a common substratum.' the relation of the jiva and prakrti to isvara is as of body and soul or as a mode (prakara) and its substratum (prakari). the relation between the body and soul of an ordinary being is, however, separable at death. but it is inseparable in the case of isvara and this jiva-cum-prakrti body. in this sense isvara is the field-knower (ksetrajna) of the field (ksetra) constituted of all individual entities conscient and inconscient, just as in each individual personality the jiva and the body are the field-knower and the field respectively.  [being in co-ordinate predication (samanadhikaranya), brahman is an inseparable but mutually distinct complex of prakrti, jiva and isvara. the cosmic mode of body constituted of prakrti and purusa is at intervals in alternate states of latency and patency (pralaya and srsti or dissolution and manifestation). as the soul of a complex whole, he can be denoed by any of the terms entering into it - isvara, prakrti or jiva. brahan is sometimes mentioned in the srutis as asat when everything is in latency in pralaya, and as sat when all entities are in manifestations (srsti). all these expressions denote him only. he is described in some texts as attributeless. it means only that he is without any undesriable evil alities. he is on the other hand endowed with countless auspicious attributes.  all these contentions are supported by numerous vedic passages, which are oted in the commentary.]",
  " somewhere in  the scriputures it is heard that 'the  field-sensitizer must be worshipped'.  is he the same as the soul, or the lord or an altogether different third entity ?  on a doubt regarding this problem -   the bhagavat instructs-idam etc.  ksetrajnam etc.  for persons of wordly life their body  is the ksetra  'field'  where the seeds of action grow.  that is why their personal  soul covered with incoming  (or foreign, not-natural)  dirt, is called field-sensitizer. in the case of the enlightened persons, the self-same body is  [again]  the ksetra,  but there is difference in etimological meaning viz :  it decays  the fetters of the result of action by means of consuming [it] ,  and it protects  [them] from the fear of birth-and-death  [cycle].  with reference to these  persons, the supreme soul, vasudeva is the field-sensitizer.  he who sensitizes this field :  he who causes it to know.  here the root vid includes within itself,  the meaning of the causal  suffix ni.  therefore  [the meaning is :]  he, on account of whose grace this insentient [body] attains the status of being sentient, he alone, an no one else, is the field-sensitizer.  but, the  [only]  difference is this :  taking into consideration th aspect of limited pervaisveness,  he is taken to be soul , and on account of  [his] unlimited pervasiveness in all the fields,  [he is called] the supreme soul, the bhagavat  vasudeva.  of  me :  the sixth case here is in the objective sense.  hence the idea is :  i may be known by means  of  this knowledge",
  "ca api, and , viddhi, understand , mam, me, the supreme god who is transcendental , to be the ksetrajnam, 'knower of the field' with the characterisitics noted above , sarva-ksetresu, in all the fields. the idea is this: know the 'knower of the field'- who has become diversified by limiting adjuncts in the form of numerous 'fields' ranging from brahma to a clump of grass-as free from differentiations resulting from all the limiting adjuncts, and as beyond the range of such words and ideas as existece, nonexistence, etc. o scion of the bharata dynasty, since there remains nothing to be known apart from the true nature of the field, the knower of the field and god, therefore , tat, that , is jnanam, knowledge, right knowledge , yat, which , is the jnanam, knowledge , ksetra-ksetrajnayoh, of the field and the knower of the field-which are the two knowables-, and by which knowledge the field and the knower of the field are made objects of knowledge. this is mama, my, god vishu's , matam, opinion. objection: well, if it be that in all the field there exists god alone, and none else other than him, as the enjoyer, then god will become a mundane being , or, due to the absence of any mundane creature other than god, there will arise the contingency of the negation of mundance existence. and both these are undesirable, since the scriptures dealing with bondage, liberation and their causes will become useless, and also becuase they contradict such valid means of knowledge as direct perception. in the first place, mundane existence which is characterized by happiness, sorrow and their cause is apprehended through direct perception. besides, from the perception of variety in the world it can be inferred that mundane existence results from virtue and vice. all this becomes illogical if god and the individual soul be one. reply: no, because this becomes justifiable owing to the difference between knowledge and ignorance. 'these two, viz that which is know as knowledge and that which is known as ignorance are widely contradictory, and they follow divergent courses' (ka. 1.2.4.) , and similarly, the different results, viz liberation and enjoyment, belonging (respectively) to those knowledge and ignorance, have also been pointed out to be contrary by saying that liberation is the goal of knowledge, and enjoyment is the result of ignorance (see ka. 1.2.2). vyasa, also has said so: 'now, there are these two paths' (mbh sa. 241.6) etc. and, 'there are only these two paths,' etc. here (in the gita) also, two kinds of steadfastness have been stated. and it is understood from the vedas, the smrtis and reason that ignorance together with its effects has to be destroyed by knowledge. as for the vedic texts, they are: 'if one has realized here, then there is truth , if he has not realized here, then there is great destruction' (ke. 2.5) , 'knowing him in this way, one becomes immortal here' (nr. pu. 6) , 'there is no other path to go by' (sv. 3.8) ,  'the enlightened man is not afraid of anything' (tai. 2.9.1). on the other hand, (the texts) with regard to the unenlightened person are: 'then, he is smitten with fear' (tai. 2.7.1) , 'living in the midst of ognorance' (ka. 1.2.5) ,  one who knows brahman becomes brahman indeed. in his line is not born anyone who does not know brahman' (mu. 3.2.9) , '(while he who worships another god thinking,) 'he is one, and i am another,' does not know. he is like an animal to the gods' (br. 1.4.10). he who is a knower of the self, 'he becomes all this (universe)' (br. 1.4.10) , 'when men will fold up space like (folding) leather, (then) there will be cessation of sorrow, without knowing the deity' (sv. 6.9). there are thousands of texts like these. and the smrti texts (from the gita) are: 'knowledge remains covered by ignorance. thery the creatures become deluded' (5.15) , 'here itself is rirth conered by them whose minds are established on sameness' (5.19) ,  'since by seeing eally the god who is present alike everywhere (he does not injure the self by the self, therefore he attains the supreme goal)' (13.28), etc. and as for reason, there is the text, 'men avoid snakes, tips of kusa-grass as also well when they are aware of them. some fall into them owing to ignorance. thus, see the special result arising from knowledge' (mbh. sa. 201.17). similarly, it is known that an unelightened person, who identifies himself with the body etc. and who practises righteousness and unrighteousness under the impulsion of attachment and aversion, takes birth and dies. it cannot be reasonably denied by anyone that, those who see the self as different from the body etc. become liberated as a result of the cessation of righteous and unrighteous conduct, which depends on the destruction of attachment and aversion. the being so, the knower of the field, who is reality is god himself, appears to have become a mundane soul owing to the various adjuncts which are products of ignorance , as for instance the individual soul becomes identified with the body etc. for it is a well-known fact in the case of all creatures that their self-identify with the body etc. which are not-self is definitely caused by ignorance. just as, when a stump, of a tree is firmly regarded as a man, the alities of a man do not thery come to exist in the stump, nor do the alities of the stump come to the person, similarly the property ofconsciousness does not come to the body, nor those of the body to consciousness. it is not proper that the self should be identified with happiness, sorrow, delusion, etc., since they, like decrepitude and death, are eally the products of ignorance. objection: may it not be said that this is not so, becuase of dissimilarity? the stump and the man, which are verily objects of perception, are superimposed on each other through ignorance by their perceiver. on the other hand, in the case of the body and the self,, the mutual superimposition occurs verily between a knower and an object of perception. thus, the illustration is not eally applicable. therefore, may it not be that the properties of the body, though objects of knowledge, belong to the self which is the knower? reply: no, since there arises the contingency of (the self) becoming devoid of consciousness! if alities such as happiness, sorrow, delusion, desire, etc. of the body etc., which are the field and are objects of knowledge, indeed belong to the knower, then it will be necessary to explain the particular reason why some of the alities of the object of knowledge-the field-superimposed through ignorance belong to the self, while decrepitude, death, etc. do not. (on the contrary) it is possible to infer that they (happiness etc.) do not pertain to the self, since, like decrepitude etc., they are superimposed on the self through ignorance, and because they are either avoidable or acceptable. this being so, the mundane state, consisting of agentship and enjoyership pertaining to the objects of knowledge, is superimposed on the knower through ignorance. hence, nothing of the knower is affected thery-in the same way as nothing of the sky is affected by the superimposition of surface, diret, etc. (on it) by fools. such being the case, not the least touch of the mundane state is to be apprehended with regard to the almighty [see footnote on p.5, and p.168.] god, the knower of the field, even though he exists in all the fields. for it is nowhere seen in the world that anybody is benefitted or harmed by a ality attributed to him through ignorance. as for the statement that the illustration is not eally applicable-that is wrong. objection: how? reply: because what is intended as common between the illustration and the thing illustrated is merely the superimposition through ignorance. there is no disagreement as to that. however, as for your contention that the illustration fails with regard to the knower, that too has been shown to be inapt by citing the example of decrepitude etc. [if it be held that objects of experience may be superimposed on one another, but they cannot be superimposed on the experiencer, the answer is that this cannot be a universal proposition. for decrepitude and death, which are matters of experience, are superimposed on the self, the experiencer.] objection: may it not be that the knower of the field becomes a mundane being owing to his having ignorance? reply: no, because ignorance is of the nature of tamas. since ignorance has the nature of covering, it is indeed a notion born of tamas , it makes one perceive contrarily, or it arouses doubt, or it leads to non-perception. for it disappears with the dawn of discrimination. and the three kind of ignorance, viz non-perception etc. [etc: false perception and doubt.], are experienced when there are such defects as blindness etc. which are forms of tamas and have the nature of veiling. [it is known through the process of agreement and difference that false perception etc. arise from some defects,and they are not the alities of the self.] objection: here it is asserted that if this be the case, then ignorance is a ality of the knower? reply: no, for the defects such as blindness are seen to belong to the eye which is an organ. as for your notion that 'ignorance is a ality of the experiencer, and the very fact of being possessed of the ality of ignorance is what constitutes the mundane state of the knower of the field , the assertion which was made (by the vedantin) in that connection, 'that the knower of th field is god himself and not a mundane being, ' is improper,'-this is not so. as for example: since such defects as false perception etc. are seen to belong to the organ eye, therefore false perception etc. or their causes, viz defects like blindness etc., do not belong to the perceiver. just as blindness of the eyes does not pertain to the perceiver since on being curved through treatment it is not seen in the perceiver, similarly notions like non-perception, false perception, doubt, and their causes should, in all cases, pertain to some organ , not to the perceiver, the knower of the field. and since they are objects of perception, they are not alities of the knower in the same way that light is of a lamp. just because they are objects of perception, they are cognized as different from one's own self. besides, it is denied by all schools of thought that in liberation, when all the organs depart, there is any association with such defects as ignorance etc. if they (the defects) be the alities of the self itself, the knower of the field, as heat is of fire, then there can never be a dissociation from them. again, since there can be no association with or dissociation from anything for the immutable, formless self which is all-pervading like space, therefore it is established that the knower of the field is ever identical with god. this follows alos from the utternance of the lord, 'being without beginning and without alities' (31), etc. objection: well, if this be so, then, owing to the nonexistence of the world and the mundane creatures, there will arise the defect of the uselessness of the scriptures, etc. reply: no, since this (defect) is admitted by all. a defect that is admitted by all who believe in the self is not to be explained by one alone! objection: how has this been admitted by all? reply: people of all schools of thought who believe in the self admit that there is no worldly behaviour or the behaviour of a worldling in the liberated ones. yet, in their case (i.e. in those various schools), it is not admitted that there is any possibility of such a defect as the scriptures becoming useless, etc. similarly, in our case let the scriptures be useless when the knowers of the field become identified with god , and purposeful within the sphere of ignorance. this is just as in the case of all the dualists, where it is admitted that the scriptures etc. become useful in the state of bondage, not in the state of liberation. objection: well, for us all dualists, bondage and liberation of the self are real in the truest sense. so, when things to be renounced or accepted as also the means thereto are real, the scriptures etc. become meaningful. on the other hand, may it not be that for the non-dualists, since duality deos not exist in truest sense, it being the creation of ignorance, therefore the state of bondage of the self is not ultimately real, and hence the scriptures etc. become purposeless as they remain shorn of a subject-matter? reply: no, since it is not logical that the self should have different states. if this were possible at all, then the states of bondage and freedom of the self should be simultaneous, or successive. as to that, they cannot occur simultaneously, since they are contradictory-like rest and motion in the same object. should they occur successively and without being caused, then there will arise the contingency of there being no liberation , if they occur through some cause, then, since they do not exist inherently, there arises the contingency of their being ultimately unreal. in this case also the assumption becomes falsified. moreover, when ascertaining the precedence and succession of the states of bondage and liberation, the state of bondage will have to be considered as being the earlier and having no beginning, but an end. and that is contrary to valid means of knowledge. similarly it will have to be admitted that the state of liberation has a beginning, but no end- which is certainly opposed to valid means of knowledge. and it is not possible to established eternality for something that has states nd undergoes a change from one state to another. on the other hand, if for avoiding the defect of non-eternality the different states of bondage and liberation be not assumed, then, even for the dualists such defects as the purposelessness of the scriptures become certainly unavoidable. thus, the situation being similar (for both), it is not for the advaitin (alone) to refute the objection. nor do the scriptures become purposeless, because the scriptures are applicable to the commonly known unenlightened person. it is indeed in the case of the ignorant person-not in the case of the enlightened one-that there occurs the perception of identity of the self with the effect (i.e. enjoyership) and the cause (i.e. agentship) which are not-self. for, in the case of the enlightened persons, it is impossible that, after the dawn of the realization of non-identity of the self with effect and cause, they can have self identification with these as 'i'. surely, not even a downright fool, or a lunatic and such others, see water and fire or shade and light as identical , what to speak of a discriminating person! therefore, such being the case, the scriptures dealing with injunction and prohibition do not concern a person who sees the distinction of the self from effect and cause. for, when devadatta is ordered to do som work with the words, 'you do this,' visnumitra who happens to be there does not, even on hearing the ?nd, conclude, 'i have been ordered.' but this conclusion is reasonable when the person for whom the order is meant is not understood. so also with regard to cause and effect. objection: can it not be that, even after having realized the self as different from effect and cuase, it is ite reasonable from the standpoint of natural relationship, [natural relationship-self-identification with the body through ignorance.] that with regard to the scriptures one should have the understanding, 'i am enjoined to adotp the means that yields a desired result, and am porhibited from adopting the means that leads to an undesirable result'? as for instance, in the case of a father and son, or between others, even though there exists the awareness of the distinction between each other, still there is the comprehension of the implication of the injunctions and prohibitions meant for one as being also meant for the other. [in the (br. (1.5.17) we read, 'now therefore the entrusting: when a man thinks he will die, he says to his son, 'you are brahman, you are the sacrifice, and you are the world,'' etc. it has been enjoined here in this manner that the son should accept as his own all the duties thus entrusted to him by the father. similarly, it is understood that when a son in unable to perform his own duties, the father has to accept them. so also in the case of brothers and others. thus, in the case of the enlightened person also, though there is a comprehension of his own distinction from effect and cause, still, owing to his earlier relationship with ignorance, body, etc., there is no contradiction in his understanding that the injunctions and prohibitions are meant for him.] reply: no, since identification of the self with effect and cause is possible only before attaining the knowledge of the self as distinct (from them). it is only after one has followed (or eschewed) what is enjoined or prohibited by the scriptures that he comprehends his own distinction from the effect and cause , not before. [in b.s. (3.4.26-7) it is said that the merit earned by the performance of scriptural duties helps to generate knowledge of brahman. therefore these duties are not meant for the enlightened. (by following what is enjoined, and avoiding what is prohibited, one's mind becomes purified, and then only one understands he is different from cause and effect-agentship and enjoyership.-tr.)] therefore it is established that the scriptures dealing with injunctions and prohibitions are meant for the ignorant.  objection: well, if (injunctions and prohibitions) such as, 'one who desires heaven shall perform sacrifices', 'one should not eat poisoned meat,' etc. be not observed by those who have realized the self as distinct and by those who view only the body as the self, then, from the absence of any observer of those (injunctions etc.) there would follow the uselessness of the scriptures. reply: no, because engagement in or abstention from actions follows from what is ordained by the scriptures. as for one who has realized the identity of the lord and the knower of the field, one who has realized brahman-he does not engage in action. similarly, even the person who does not believe in the self does not engage in action, under the idea that the other world does not exist. however, one who has inferred the existence of the self on the ground of the wellknown fact that study of the scriptures dealing with injunctions and prohibitions becomes otherwise purposeless, who has no knowledge of the essential nature of the self, and in whom has arisen hankering for the results of actions-he faithfully engages in action. this is a matter of direct perception to all to us. hence, the scriptures are not purposeless. objection: may it not be that the scriptures will become meaningless when, by noticing abstention from action in the case of men with discrimination, their followers too will abstain? reply: no, because discrimination arises in some rare person only. for, as at present, some rare one among many people comes to possess discrimination. besides, fools do not follow one who has discrimination, because (their) engagement in action is impelled by defects such as attachment etc. and they are seen to get engaged in such acts as black magic. moreover, engagement in action is natural. verily has it been said (by the lord), 'but it is nature that acts' (5.14). therefore, the mundane state consists of nothing but ignorance, and is an object of perception (to the ignorant man who sees it) just as it appears to him. ignorance and its effects do not belong to the knower of the feild, the absolute. moreover, false knowledge cannot taint the supreme reality. for, water in a mirage cannot taint the supreme reality. for, water in a mirage cannot make a desert muddy with its moisture. similarly, ignorance cannot act in any way on the knower of the field. hence has this been said, 'and understand me to be knower of the field,' as also, 'knowledge remains covered by ignorance' (5.15). objection: then, what is this that even the learned say like the worldly people, 'thus [possessed of aristorcracy etc.] am i,' 'this [body, wife, etc.] verily belongs to me'? reply: listen. this is that learnedness which consists in seeing the field as the self! on the contrary, should they realize the unchanging knower of the field, then they will not crave for enjoyment or action with the idea, 'may this be mine.' enjoyment and action are mere perversions. this being so, the ignorant man engages in action owing to his desire for results. on the other hand, in the case of an enlightened person who has realized the changeless self, engagement in aciton in impossible because of the absence of desire for results. hence, when the activities of the aggregate of body and organs cease, his withdrawal from action is spoken of in a figurative sense.  some may have this other kind of learnedness: 'the knower of the field is god himself , and the field is something different and an object of knowledge to the knower of the field. but i am a mundane being, happy and sorrowful. and it is my duty to bring about the cessation of worldly existence through the knowledge of the field and the knower of the field, and by continuing to dwell in his true nature after directly perceiving through meditation god, the knower of the field,' and he who, understands thus, and he who teaches that 'he (the taught) is not the knower of the field,' and he who, being under such an idea, thinks, 'i shall render meaningful the scriptures dealing with the worldly state and liberation'-is the meanest among the learned. that self-immolator, being devoid of any link with the traditional interpreters of the purport of the scriptures, misinterprets what is enjoined in the scriptures and imagines what is not spoken there, and thery himself becoming deluded, befools others too. hence, one who is not a knower of the traditional interpretation is to be ignored like a fool, though he may be versed in all the scriptures. as for the objection that, if god be one with the knower of the field, he will then become a mundane being, and that, if the knowers of the fields are one with god, then from the nonexistence of mundane beings will follow the absence of the mundane state, -these two objections have been refuted by admitting knowledge and ignorance as having different characteristics. objection: how? reply: by saying that any defect imagined through ignorance does not affect the supreme reality which is the substratum of that (imagination). in accordance with this an illustration was cited that a desert is not made muddy by water in a mirage. even the defect of the possibility of nonexistence of the mundange state, conseent on the nonexistence of individual souls, stands refuted by the explanation that the mundane state and the individual souls are imagined through ignorance. objection: the defect of mundane existence in the knower of the field consists in his being possessed of ignorance. and sorrowfulness etc. which are its products are matters of direct experience. reply: no, since whatever is known is an attribute of the field, therefore the knower-the knower of the field-cannot reasonably be tainted by the defects arising from it. whatsoever blemish-not existing in the knower of the field-you attribute to it is logically an object of experience, and hence it is verily a ality of the field , not the ality of the knower of the field. nor does the knower of the field become tainted thery, because of knower cannot possibly have any conjunction with an object of knowledge. should there be a conjunction, then there will be no possibility at all of its (the latter's) becoming a knowable. oh! sir, if being ignorant, sorrowful, etc. be alities of the self, how is it that they are directly perceived? or how can they be alities of the knower of the field? if the conclusion be that all that is known consititutes the field, and that the one who knows is verily the knower of the field, then, to say that being ignorant, sorrowful, etc.are the alities of the knower of the field and that they are directly perceived is a contradictory statement having only ignorance as its basis. here, (the opponent) asks: to whom does ignorance belong? (the answer is that) it belongs verily to him by whom it is experienced! objection: in whom is it perceived? reply: here the answer is: it is pointless to ask, 'in whom is ignorance experienced?' objection: how? reply: if ignorance be perceived (by you), then you perceive its possessor as well. moreover, when that possessor of ignorance is perceived it is not reasonable to ask, 'in whom is it perceived?' for, when an owner of cattle is seen, the estion, 'to whom do the cattle belong', does not become meaningful. objection: well, is not the illustration dissimilar? since, the cattle and their owner are directly perceived, their relation also is directly perceived. hence the estion is meaningless. ignorance and its possessor are not directly perceived in that manner, in which case the estion would have been meaningless. reply: what will it matter to you if you know the relation of ignorance with a person who is not directly perceived as possessed of ignorance? opponent: since ignorance is a source of evil, therefore it should be got rid of. reply: he to whom ignorance belongs will get rid of it! opponent: indeed, ignorance belongs to myself. reply: in that case, you know ignorance as also yourself who possess it? \t opponent: i know, but not through direct perception. reply: if you know through inference, then how is the connection (between yourself and ignorance) known? surely it is not possible for you the knower to have at that time ['when you are knowing your own ignorance.'] the knowledge of the relation (of the self) with ignorance which is an object of knowledge , ['after having perceived ignorance as an object of your knowledge, how can you who continue to be the knower cognize yourself as the knower of that ignorance? for this would lead to the contradiction of the same person becoming the subject and the object of cognition.'] because the cognizer is then engaged in cognizing ignorance as an object. besides, there cannot be someone who is a (separate) cognizer of the relation between the knower and ignorance, and a separate cognition of that (relation), for this would lead to infinite regress. if the knower and the relation between the knower and the thing known be cognizable, then a separate cognizer has to be imagined. of him, again, another knower has to be imagined , of him again a separate cognizer would have to be imagined! thus, an infinite regress be comes unavoidable. again, whether the knowable be ignorance or anything else, a knowable is verily a knowable , similarly, even a knower is surely a knower , he does not become a knowable. and when this is so, [since the knower cannot be known, therefore his relation with ignorance also cannot be known by himself or by anybody else] nothing of the cognizer-the knower of the field-is tainted by such defects as ignorance, sorrowfulness, etc. objection: may it not be said that the (self's) defect is surely this, that the field, which is full of defects, is cognized (by it)? reply: no, because it is the immutable, which is consciousness, by nature, that is figuratively spoken of as the cognizer. it is just like figuratively attributing the act of heating to fire merely because of its (natural) heat. just as it has been shown here by the lord himself that identification with action, cause and effect are absent in the self, and that action, cause, etc. are figuratively attributed to the self owing to their having been superimposed (on it) through ignorance, so has it been shown by him in various places: 'he who thinks of this one as the killer৷৷.' (2.19), 'while actions are being done in ever way by the gunas of nature' (3.27), 'the omnipresent neither accepts anybody's sin৷৷.' (5.15), etc. it has been explained by us, too, in that very way, and in the following contexts also we shall explain accordingly. objection: well, in that case, if identification with action, cause and effect be naturally absent in the self, and it they be superimpositions through ignorance, then it amounts to this that actions are meant for being undertaken only by the ignorant, not by the enlightened.    reply: it is true that is comes to this. this very fact we shall explain under the verse, 'since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body৷৷.' (18.11). and, in the context dealing with the conclusion of the purport of the whole scripture, we shall explain this elaborately under the verse, '৷৷.in brief indeed, o son of kunti,৷৷.which is the supreme consummation of knowledge' (ibid. 50) it is needless here to expatiate further, hence we conclude. the next verse, '(hear about)৷৷.what that field is,' etc., summarizing the purport of the chapter dealing with the 'field' taught in the verses begining from 'this body৷৷.'etc., is being presented. for it is proper to introduce briefly the subject-matter that is sought to be explained",

[if the supreme one also acts like us, then he is no god.] thus, since the upanisadic philosophy as stated by the lord is in every way difficult to understand and difficult to explain, it has therefore been abandoned by the vaisesikas, the sankhyas, the jainas and the buddhists. reply: as to that, the following refutation has been stated by the lord himself in, 'but it is nature that acts' (5.14). indeed, nature, which is nothing but ignorance, acts and becomes affected. in this way empirical dealing becomes possible , but in reality it does not occur in the one supreme self. it has been accordingly shown by the lord in various places that there is no duty to be performed by those who adhere to this philosophy of discriminating knowledge of the supreme reality, who are steadfast in knowledge, who have spurned actions arising out of ignorance, and who are mendicants belonging to the highest order of monks. the lord cites an illustration to show like what it does not act and is not affected:",

(ibid., 2.13.89). and also:  'are you the head or the belly?  are you indeed the feet and other limbs, or do they belong to you, o king?  you are distinct in your nature from all your members, o king. know, o king, and understand 'who am i' '. (ibid., 1.13.102-3).  moreover they state that vasudeva constitutes the self of the distinct entities (ksetra and ksetrajna):  'the senses, manas, buddhi, vigour, splendour, strength, courage, both ksetra and ksetrajna have vasudeva for their self. (ma. bha. sa., 149.136).  in various distinctive hymns, namely, in the vedas, rg, yajus, saman and atharvan, the distinction of body and the self has been sung. the nature of the body is described in the following text:  'from this self, verily, ether arose , from the ether, air , from air, fire , from fire, water , from water, the earth , from the earth, herbs , from the herbs, food , from food, the person. the same person, verily, consists of the essence of food' (tai. u., 2.1.2). afterwards that which is inner than this (body) and which consists of prana (or the vital breath), and that which is inner than this and which consists of mind are described. the nature of ksetrjna is stated in the passage:  'verily, other than, and within, that one that consists of mind, that (the individual self) consists of understanding' (ibid., 2.4.2). later, the supreme brahman is stated in the text , 'verily, other than, and within, that one consisting of understanding, is the supreme self that consists of bliss' (ibid., 1.5.2). this is stated to be the surpeme self, consisting of bliss, as forming the inner self of the individual self. similarly in the three vedas, rg, saman and atharvan, here and there, the distinctive existence of the ksetra and the ksetrajna is affirmed with brahman for their self.  likewise, the same purpose is taught in the words of the brahma-sutras, namely, the aphorisms about brahman, known also as the sariraka-sutras, which are characterised by reasoning, decision and conclusion. in the sutras commencing with, 'not ether, on account of the absence of the sruti' (b. s., 2.3.1), the nature and the mode of the ksetra is determined. in the sutras commencing with 'not the self, on account of the sruti and on account of the eternity, (which is made out) from them' (ibid., 2.3.18), the true nature of the ksetrajna is determined. in the sutras 'but from the supreme, this being declared by sruti' (ibid., 2.3.40), that ksetrajna has the lord for its self on account of its being under the control of the lord, is declared. it has been sung in various ways , the meaning of this sloka is this:  listen about the truths of the ksetra and the ksetrajna which have been expounded in numerous ways and declared by me in a lucid and brief manner",

  "thus, in the manner explained, those who 'rest in sattva rise upwards,' namely, they attain liberation from the bonds of samsara gradually. those who, 'abiding in rajas' which produces greed for heaven etc., engage themselves in actions which constitute the means for obtaining such results. experiencing those results, they are born again and engage in, and perform, the very same acts. so they remain in the 'middle'. this is mostly suffering, as it is characterised by rirths. those of tamasic nature 'stoop down' into lower levels, as tamas grows ever worse in them. they go 'downwards' i.e., to the lowest state among human beings, then to the condition of animals , then to that of worms , insects etc., then of immovable things, and even to the condition of shrubs and creepers, and ultimately to the condition of stones, wood, clod of earth, straw etc.  sri krsna now teaches about the manner of those in whom the sattva has gradually increased by adopting special holy food and performance of special disinterested deeds, and who thus rise upward by transcending the gunas",

  "among them, sattva, being pure, [nirmala, pure-transparent, i.e., capable of resisting any form of ignorance, and hence as illuminator, i.e.a revealer of consciousness.] is an illuminator and is harmless. o sinless one, it binds through attachment to happiness and attachment to knowledge",
  "of 'these', i.e., of sattva, rajas and tamas, the characteristic nature of the sattva is this:  it illuminates on account of its being pure. what is called purity is to be bereft of alities which veil light and happiness. because its nature is solely the generation of light and happiness, it constitutes the cause of light and happiness. 'light' or illumination is enlightenment about a thing as it is. it is 'not morbid,' i.e., an effect called morbidity (disease) does not exist in its presence. the meaning is, that sattva is the cause of health.  the guna, called sattva, however, binds the self by attachment to happiness and knowledge. the meaning is that it causes attachment to happiness and knowledge. when attachment to knowledge and happiness is born, one engages oneself in secular and vedic means for securing them. conseently, one is born in such bodies which constitute the means for realising such fruits. hence the sattva binds the self through attachment to happiness and knowledge. what is said is this:  sattva generates knowledge and happiness , again it generates attachment to them",
  "tatra, among them, among sattva etc. ,-the characteristics of sattva itself is being stated first-sattva, nirmalatvat, being pure like a crystal stone ,is prakasakam, an illuminator , and anamayam, harmless. anagha, o sinless one , badhnati, it binds. how? sukhasangena, through attachment to happiness. bringing about the association of happiness, which is the object, with the self, which is the subject, in the form of the idea, 'i am happy', is certainly an unreal contact with happiness. this as such is nescience, for the ality of an object cannot belong to a subject. and it has been said by the lord that all the alities, from 'desire' to 'fortitude' (see 13.6), are, indeed, of the field, which is the object. therefore, it is certainly through nescience, which is an attribute [in reality, though nescience has no connection with the self, yet, since there is none other with which it can become associated and since it has no independence, therefore the commentator imagines it as an attribute of the self.] of the self and has the characteristics of non-discrimination between object and subject, that sattva apparently brings about the association with happiness, which is not the self. it makes (the self) attached, as it were , [here ast. adds 'asangam saktam iva, (makes) the unattached attached, as it were'.-tr.] makes one not possessed of happiness as though possessed of it! similarly, it binds also jnana-sangena, through attachment to knowledge. [jnana, derived in the sense of 'that through which one knows,' means an instrument of knowledge, and not consciousness. (s.: knowledge arising from the study of the import of various scriptures , or, jnanam, means the scriptures, through which the supreme god is known and which leads to devotional practices, but not to steadfastness in (the absolute) brahman.] because of its concomitance with happiness, knowledge here is an attribute of the internal organ, the field, but not of the self. were it an attribute [if knowledge were a natural attribute of the self, then there can be no estion of the latter again becoming bound through association with the former.] of the self, there could be no contact (between it and the self), and 'bondage' would become illogical. association with knowledge etc. should be understood in the same sense as with happiness",
  "know thou rajas to be of the nature of passion, the source of thirst (for sensual enjoyment) and attachment , it binds fast, o arjuna, the embodied one by attachment to action",

  "know rajas to be of the nature of passion, born of hankering and attachment. o son of kunti, that binds the embodied one through attachment to action",
  "rajas is of the nature of passion, namely, it causes sexual desire. 'passion' (raga) is mutual yearning between a man and a woman. 'springing from thirst and attachment' means it is the source of sensuality and attachment. 'trsna', (thirst, sensuality) is the longing for all sense-objects, such as sound etc. 'sanga' (attachment) is the inordinate longing for union with one's sons, friends and such other relations. by creating longing for actions, it binds the embodied self. whatever actions have been begun by the self from longiing for sensual enjoyments, they become the cause of births in bodies that constitute the means for experiencing such enjoyments. therefore rajas binds the embodied self through attachment to actions. what is said is this:  rajas is the cause of sexuality, sensuality and attachment, and of constant engagement in actions",

  "by 'false knowledge' is here to be understood as what is other than knowledge. what is called knowledge is right perception of things. what is other than this is false knowledge. and tamas springs from knowledge contrary to the true nature of thinngs. it deludes all embodied selves. delusion is erroneous knowledge. the meaning is that tamas is the cause of erroneous knowledge. being the cause of negligence, indolence and sleep, it binds the embodied self through them. 'negligence' is inattentiveness, which causes one to perform works other than what ought to be done. 'indolence' is the tendency to avoid work , it may even develop into absolute inaction. 'sleep.' is the state in which the external organs stop working due to exhaustion and seek to recover from the same. in sleep when only the outgoing actionof the senses stop, it is called dream state. when even the mind (manas) ceases to function, it is called dreamless sleep.  he states the cardinal feature forming the ways of bondage through sattva etc",

  "the lord said  the vedas speak of the imperishable 'asvattha tree' called samsara, which has its 'roots above and branches below', in such passages as the following:  this asvattha tree with its roots above and branches below is eternal' (ka. u., 6.1), and 'he who knows the tree with its roots above and branches below' (tai. a., 1.11.5). it has its roots above since it has its roots in brahma (the creator otherwise known as hiranyagarbha) who is seated above the seven worlds. it has 'branches below' ending with denizens like men, animals, beasts, worms, insects, birds and immovables. it is 'immutable' since it cannot be felled, being of the form of a continual flow. it can be felled only at the dawn of perfect knowledge which causes detachment. they say that the leaves of this asvattha tree constitute the vedas. 'the vedas are said to be the leaves', since this tree of samsara increases by actions prompted by worldly desires as taught in certain srutis as, 'he who desires prosperity should sacrifice a white animal to vayu' (taitt. sam., 2.1.1) and 'the desirer of offspring shall offer to indra and agni a sacrifice with eleven cups of rice-cakes' (ibid., 2.2.1). indeed the tree flourishes with the help of leaves. he who knows the asvattha of such a nature 'knows the vedas'. the vedas also set forth the means of felling this tree of samsara. he who understands this is called the knower of the vedas, since knowledge of the nature of the tree to be cut off is helpful to the knowledge concerning the means of felling the tree.  this tree spreads downward with men etc., who are the products of their karma, as branches. it again spreads above into gandharvas, yaksas, gods, etc. they are nourished by the gunas of sattva etc. they have tender shoots augmented by sense-objects.  how does this happen?  sri krsna explains:",
  "urdhva-mulam, that which has its roots upwards:- brahman, possessed of the unmanifest power in the form of maya, is referred to by the word 'upward' because of its subtleness in point of time by virtue of its being the cause, and also because of its eternality and vastness , and that is the root (mulam) of this world. the tree of the world which is such, is urdhva-mulam. this accords with the upanisadic text, 'this has its roots above and branches below' (ka. 2.6.1). in the purana also we have: it sprouts from the root in the form of the unmanifest , it grows through the sturdiness of that very one. and it has abundance of intelligence as its trunk, and the appertures of the organs as the hollows. the great elements are its boughs [a.g. takes the word visakha (boughs) in the sense of stambha, perhaps meaning the aerial roots.-tr.] , so also, it has the objects of perception as its leaves. it has virtue and vice as its beautiful flowers, and happiness and sorrow are the fruits it bears. this eternal tree presided over by brahman is a means of livelihood to all creatures. and this verily is the resort of brahman [or, etat brahma-vanam means: this tree has brahman as its object of adoration, its support. for, the world has nothing but brahman as its support.] in it brahman dwells for ever. having felled and split this tree with the great sword of knowledge, and then attaining the bliss of the self, one does not return from that (bliss).' (cf. mbh. as. 47.12-15.) that tree which has its roots upwards and is constituted by the enchantment of mundane existence, and adhah-sakham, which has the branches downwards-mahat, [see under 7.4.-tr.] egoism, subtle elements, etc. are its branches (sakhah), as it were, extending downwards (adhah) , so, it has its branches downwards- , that tree with its branches downwards, which does not (a) last (stha) even for the morrow (svah), is asvatthah (lit. peepul tree). ahuh, they say , that the asvatthah, peepul tree, undergoing destruction every moment , is avyayam, imperishable, and constituted by the enchantments of mundane existence. having been in existence from time without beginning, that tree of the world is imperishable. it is, indeed, will known as the sustainer of the beginningless and ceaseless series of bodies etc. they call that the imperishable. of that very tree of the world here is another alification: yasya, that tree of the world of which , chandamsi-chandas being derived in the sense of covering (protecting)-, the vedas in the form of rk, yajus and sama , are the parnani, leaves,  as it were. as leaves serve as protectors of a tree, so the vedas serve as the protectors of the world , for they reveal what are virtue and vice as also their causes and results. yah, he who , veda, knows , tam, that-the tree of the world along with its root, as has been explained , sah, he , is a vedavit, knower of the vedas, i.e. versed in the meaning of the vedas. since, apart from this tree of the world along with its root, not even an iota of any other thing remains to be known, therefore he who knows the purport of the vedas is omniscient. in this way the lord euligizes the knowledge of the tree together with its root. an imagery of the other parts of that very tree of the world is being presented:",

  "controlling everything by my will, i exist as 'the self in their hearts', namely, in the place from which springs knowledge, the root of activity and inactivity of all beings as also of the soma and digestive fire. so the srutis declare in the following texts:  'entering within, he is the ruler of all things and the self of all' (tai. a., 3.11), 'he who, dwelling in the earth ৷৷. he who, dwelling in the self, is within the self ৷৷. who controls the earth' (br. u. madh., 3.7. 3. 22) , 'the heart which is comparable to an inverted lotus-bud' (ma. na., 11.7) , and 'now, here, in the city of brahman, is an abode, a small lotus-flower' (cha. u., 8.1.1). the smrtis also declare thus:  'visnu is the ruler of the whole universe, who permeates the universe' (v. p., 1.17. 20), 'he is the ruler of all, who is minutely small among those who are minutely small (manu., 12.122) , and 'he is the controller, the judge, the king, who is seated in your heart' (ibid., 8.92).  therefore, the memory of all beings springs from me alone. 'memory' is knowledge springing from experience and its subtle impressions. they have for their contents past experiences. 'knowledge' is determination of a thing through the senses, inference, the scriptures and intuitive meditation. this is also from me. so does 'apohana' too. 'apohana' signifies the cessation of knowledge. 'apohana' may also mean 'uhana' (conjectural knowledge). uhana is 'uha' (conjecture). 'uha' is that knowledge which is accessory to the actual means of knowledge (pramana). it is done by determining whether that means of knowledge can be operative with reference to the particular subject-matter on hand, through the examination of the instruments of that means of knowledge (pramana). this 'uha' also comes from me.  indeed 'i am to be known from all the vedas,' for i am the inner ruler of agni, surya, soma, vayu, sun and indra and other divinities as their self. the vedas are intent on speaking of them (i.e., the divinities). 'i am to be known from all the vedas , for, terms like gods, men etc., signify the individual selves in them. i bring about the fruition of the veda. 'vedanta', here means the end, namely, the fruition, of vedic injunctions like 'let sacrifice be made to indra' and 'let sacrifice be made to varuna.' for, all vedas find their consummation in fruition. 'antakrt' means grantor of fruits. the meaning is:  'i alone am the grantor of the fruition described in the vedas.' this has been already declared in the verses beginning from, 'whichever devotee seeks to worship with faith whatever form' and ending with, 'from that faith he gets the objects of his desire, granted in reality by me alone' (7.21 - 22) , and also 'i am the enjoyer and the only lord of all sacrifices' (9.24). i am the knower of the vedas , i know the veda that speaks about me. the sense is that he who speaks of the meaning of the vedas as otherwise than this import, is not the knower of the vedas.  therefore, listen from me alone the meaning or the essene of the vedas",

  "there are, the sastras say, 'two kinds of persons (purusas)' well known in the world - 'the perishable and the imperishable.' of the two, the persons designated by the term 'perishable' (ksara) are beings conjoint with non-conscient matter of modifiable nature, from brahma down to a blade of grass,who can be signified also by the term jivas (individual selves). here the term purusa (person) is used in singular to indicate the common single condition of being conjoined with non-conscient matter. that which is the 'imperishable' (aksara) is called 'unchanging' (kutastha), this is the released self, devoid of association with non-conscient matter, remaining in its own form. it is called 'unchangeable' inasmuch as when free from non-conscient matter, it has no specific connection with particular transformations of non-conscient matter like the bodies of brahma etc. here also the designation of the term in singular (as expressing a generic class) denoting the totality of liberated selves, is used on account of the single condition of dissociation from non-conscient matter. it does not mean that before this, in time without beginning, there existed but a single liberated self. so it is stated:  'purified by the austerity of knowledge, many have attained my state' (4.10) , and 'they are not born at the time of creation, nor do they suffer at the time of dissolution' (14.2)",
  "there are imau, these , dvau, two-grouped separately , purusau, persons, so called [persons-so called only figuratively, since they are the limiting adjuncts of the supreme person.] , loke in the world , the ksarah, mutable-one group consists of the perishable , the other person is the aksarah, immutable, opposite of the former, the power of god called maya, which is the seed of the origin of the person called the mutable. that which is the receptacle of the impressions of desires, actions, etc. of countless transmigrating creatures is called the immutable person. who are those persons? the lord himself gives the answer: ksarah, the mutable , consists of sarvani, all , bhutani, things, i.e. the totality of all mutable things. kutasthah is the one existing as maya: kuta means a heap , kutasthah, is that which exists like a heap. or, kuta is maya, deception, falsehood, crookedness, which are synonymous , that which exists in the diverse forms of maya etc. is the kutasthah. it is ucyate, called , the aksarah, immutable, because, owing to the countless seeds of worldly existence, it does not perish",
  "but distinct is the supreme purusha called the highest self, the indestructible lord who, pervading the three worlds, sustains them",
  "but higher than all am i, the supreme god, the absolute self, the eternal lord, who pervades the worlds and upholds them all",
  "but the highest person, distinct [from both this] is spoken of as the supreme self, which, being the changeless lord, sustains the triad of the world by entering into it",
  "there is the supreme person other than these. he is named the supreme self (paramatma) in all the vedas. he who, as the immutable one and the lord, entering the threefold world, supports it",
  "but different is th supreme person who is spoken of as the transcendental self, who, permeating the three worlds, upholds (them), and is the imperisahble god",
  "but there is the 'supreme person who is other than the bound and liberated selves' expressed by the terms, the 'perishable' and the 'imperishable'. he forms a completely different category. all srutis call him the supreme self. but by that very designation as the supreme self, it may be known that the supreme person is a category distinct from the bound and the liberated selves. how?  'entering the threefold world,' supports it. 'loka' (world) is that which is perceived. there are three such perceivable worlds, he enters the 'three worlds' which can be understood from the authority of the srutis. these are the world of unconscient matter, the world of conscient selves conjoined with matter, and the world of liberated selves. as understandable from the srutis, he enters into these three categories as their atman and supports them. thus, he is an entity different from the triad which he pervades and maintains. further he is different, as he is imperishable and as he is the lord. being imperishable, he is different from the bound non-conscient matter whose nature is subject to decay. he is different from the bound conscient selves as the latter is subject to prakrti and follows its laws. he is also distinguished from the liberated selves, because in their previous condition they were connected with matter and mixed with it. similarly, he is the lord of these 'three worlds,' a category distinct from those which have to be ruled",
  "tu, but , anyah, different, entirely contrary in characteristics from these , is the uttamah, supreme, most excellent , purusah, person, who is different in characteristics from these-the mutable and the immutable-, untouched by the mutable and the immutable limiting adjuncts, and is by nature eternal, pure, conscious and free , udahrtah, spoken of in the upanisads , iti, as , the paramatma, supreme self , he is paramah, supreme, as compared with the selves like body etc. created by ignorance, and is the atma, self, the inmost consciousness of all beings. hence he is the supreme self. he himself is being specially described: yah, who, by dint of his own active power inhering in the energy that is maya , [caitanya, consciousness, itself is the bala (energy) , the sakti (active power) therein is maya. through that he upholds.] avisya, permeating , loka-trayam, the three worlds-called bhuh (earth), bhuvah, (intermediate space) and svah (heaven) , bibharti, upholds (them) by merely being present in his own nature. (and he) is the avyayah, imperishable , isvarah, god, the omniscient one called narayana, who is the lord by nature. this name-the supreme person-of god as described is well known. showing that the name is apt by virtue of its etymological significance, the lord reveals himself saying, 'i am the unsurpassable god':",
  "as i transcend the perishable and am even higher than the imperishable, i am declared to be the highest purusha in the world and in the vedas",
  "beyond comparison of the eternal with the non-eternal am i, who am called by scriptures and sages the supreme personality, the highest god",
  "becuase, i have transcended the perishing and also the nonperishing, therefore i am acclaimed in the world as well as in the veda as the highest of persons",
  "because i transcend the perishable person and am also higher than the imperishable person, therefore i am styled in the smrti and the veda as the supreme person (purusotama)",
  "since i am transcendental to the mutable and above even the immutable, hence i am well known in the world and in the vedas as the supreme person",
  "inasmuch as i transcend the perishable (i.e., bound) person of the aforesaid nature, and i am higher, for reasons stated earlier, than the imperishable person or liberated self, therefore i am styled the supreme person in the smrti and srutis. the smrti is called loka by reason of its leading to the meaning of the vedas. the meaning is that i am famous in the srutis and in the smrti. in the sruti for instance , 'reaching the supreme light, it appears in its own nature. he is the supreme person' (cha. u., 8.12.3). in the smrti we have texts like 'i will approach him (sri krsna), the supreme person who is the incarnation of a portion of visnu, who is without beginning, middle or end' (v. p., 5.17.33)",
  " dvav imau etc. upto purusottamah.  what has been stated in the passage  'there are two persons in the world etc.', is this :  the body organism is made of the earth and other elements.  in the world every person, unitelligent by nature, takes the body for the self and [hence]  views the soul to be of perishing nature.  hence, the sense of duality does not come to an end with regard to the worldly persons, because of  their delusion.  but i am (the i-consciousness is)  the one favouring all, and by cutting the daulity-knot i am to be realised as the one pervading all.   (i) have transcended the perishing :   since the elements are insentient.  (i)  have transcended the nonperishing :  since the omnipresence  [of the self] is cut off (not comprehended) when the self is not properly realised.  in the world and in the veda too i am acclaimed as the highest of  persons :  the self same supreme self, admitting no duality, is described in this manner with the sentences  'he is he highest person'  and the like",

  "iti  etc.  the most secret [scripture] : because it explains  the oneness of all.  one becomes a man of wisdom by knowing this only and not by the knowledge of worldly affairs. one becomes a man of success by just understanding this, and not even by the deeds like the total victory over the foes, earning  wealth, enjoying women and so on.  the word ca  'also'  indicates a wonder.  has it not been witnessed that  [always] one becomes a man of  success by what has been accomplished ?  but it is strange that [in the present case one becomes a man of success] by just what has been realised.   the word iti  'thus'  indicates the conclusion of the treatise.  for, what is to be taught has come to an end completely.  that is why in the sixteenth chapter the eligibility of the pupil, arjuna, is exclusively dealt with , and nothing new is taught.  the intention  [of that chapter] is to say only this much :  'the divine wealth is just of that nature ,  but the devilish wealth born of illusion is of this nature , you (arjuna) are however endowed with the divine wealth of wisdom'.  hence [the lord] is going to say  'don't  worry.  [you are endowed] with the divine wealth'  (xvi, 5).  that is why earlier in the context of explaining the clash between the wisdom and ignorance this has been indicated [by me (ag.)]:  'it is the confrontation between the wisdom and ignorance that has been detailed under the pretext of [describing] the wars between the  gods and devils.'  so, while dealing essentially with the ality of a pupil, other subjects are mentioned incidentally.  so also the pair of chapters (ch. xvii &  xviii) would follow.  but the teaching [proper] has come to an end completely here itself.  for what is to be achieved is nothing but serving (attaining) the absolute lord-the serving, which is of the nature of total  absorption into him by one's entire being.  all other things are only to achieve this end.  this has been explained earlier.  the supreme happiness is indeed nothing but a complete absorption into the supreme lord by one's entire being",
  "this guhyatamam, most secret, i.e. most mystical ,- what is that?-sastram, scripture-. although the gita as a whole is spoken of as the scripture, still this chapter itself is here referred to as such, and this for eulogy as is evident from the context. for, not only has the entire meaning of the scripture gita been stated here in brief, but the whole purport of the vedas also has been comprehended here. and it has been said, 'he who realizes it is a knower of the vedas' (1), 'i alone am the object to be known through all the vedas' (15).

(ch. xviii, 63).   here, only the preceptor and the scripture are mainly capable of creating the scriptural knowledge.  but in producing reasoning, deliberation and meditation the main cause is the capacity to examine critically a thing and  it is a special attribute of the pupil and it is an important one.  therefore, with an idea that this is in arjuna and with an intention to add a preparatory note to the purposeful statement  'by critically examining this, [act as you please]' , the bhagavat, the preceptor, says  'fearlessness etc.'   the ignorance, born of the tamas (stand) occupies the devilish side.  this is repelled  (or removed) by the well augmented wisdom that takes hold of the divine part.  this is the nature of things [under estion]  'you  (arjuna) have taken refuge in the divine part viz., wisdom, born of the sattva (strand).  therefore shirking off the internal ignorance in the nature of delusion, you should undertake the action, that has the sanction of the scriptures and that is of the nature of eradicating the external foe having the form of ignorance.'  thus commences the [present] chapter.  hence -  abhayam etc., upto pandava.  these are the identification marks of a person of divine parts.

  "trividha etc.  here the ideas is this :-  what is termed scripture is indeed the one which is not created by the intellect soiled by any partisan spirit ,  further it is of the form of the firmness of the recollection ,  and it is firmly recollected because of the sovereign freedom of the awareness ,  likewise it is also of the nature of fruit etc., i.e. the nature of  the supreme brahman, the ultimate purport of speech, a flow of the pure self-consciousness , because of its free course, it starts from the internal nature of awareness and goes as for as the external flow,  beginning from the subtlest hymn (om), down to the series of  popular saying well-known in the worldly activities.  'what [the sage] says -   'also the [injunctions based on]  remembrance and the virtuous conduct of  the knowers of that [constitute authority]'.  (gautamadharmasutra, i, 2).   that scripture, by its own nature, distinguishes what is to be done and what is not to be done, in order to teach what is beneficial and what is not beneficial.   [further],  he whose heart is very tender by nature, because of the excess of  the sattva (i.e., godness) - in whatever way he behaves, that has certainly a scriptural authority.  but other person who is made dirty by the rajas or the tamas  (i.e., desire and ignorance) does not act rightly, even while performing what is enjoined in the scriptures.  for, he does not follow  the purport (the spirit) of the scripture  in its entity.  the scripture (or what is enjoined in the scripture) bears fruits only in the case of men of the sattva (goodness)  this has been declared by the scripture itself as :   'he  [alone]  enjoys the fruit of the scripture (or holy bathing place)  whose arms and feet and also mind, learning, austerity and conduct are controlled properly'.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(mb, aranyaka, ch. 80, verse 30).   any other person does not enjoy  [the fruit], because the rmains unsubdued [in his mind].  therefore, what is prescribed in the scripture bears fruit in the case of those who have abandoned desire, anger and delusion.  this is the purport of the present chapter , and it is being elaborated  [throughout].  but it is not explained  [in every  place by us (ag.), because the idea is clear enough.  but [the concerned verses] are simply written only to remove doubts regarding the readings [of the passages concerned]",

  "devotion to sacrifice, austerities and gifts is also called sat , and so any act for such purposes is named sat",
  "and the steadfastness in sacrifice, austerity and charity is spoken of as sat. and even the action meant for these is, verily, called as sat (good)",
  "therefore, devotion of persons of the first three stations who follow the vedas in respect of sacrifices, austerities and gifts is called sat, since it is auspicious. so the vedas, vedic acts and the three stations, expressed by the term 'brahmana,' since they are characterised by their connection with the words 'om tat sat,' are to be distinguished from what are not the vedas and vedic",
  " om etc. upto abhidhiyate.  an indication of the brahman i.e., an act of facing (or aiming at)  the brahman is made by these  three words viz.,  om, tat and sat.  of  them, om indicates that 'this purport of the scriptures is [to be ?]  accepted as long as one has bodily connection'.   the pronoun tat, which denotes generality and which is incapable of denoting exclusively a particular, mentions, as far as the brahman is concerned, the absence of intention for fruit.  an intention is not possible without reference to something particular. no doubt  [tat] may denote all particulars  [in general]. but it would lead to intending the fruits and the doer-ship with regard to all [in general].  even then [the brahman] cannot have connection with any particular fruit.   the vedic word sat denotes 'prasie'.  the act, like this sacrifice etc., though perormed, truns out to be an act of the tams (evil act) if it is performed with the idea, 'it is an evil act'.  further, what is performed  with an intention for a particular fruit is not praiseworthy, and it causes nothing but bondage. therefore, those, who bear in mind, 'this is a thing to be performed' - they are not fettered, even though they perform acts like sacrifice etc.  with this idea only, it has been said in the adiparvan as -   'the austerity is not dirt, nor the [vedic] study, nor the natural ritual enjoined by the vedas, and nor the act of earning wealth by all efforts.  but, if they are struck by mind, they themselves become dirt.' (mb, adi. i, 210).   [here in this passage]  dirt that which fetters.  natural :  [that is, ordained ], such as -   'without expecting anything, a brahman should learn the vedas etc., together with their six subsidiaries' etc.   by all effort :  by the act that is suitable and is well known in the scriptures and in the worldly practice.  by mind :  by the mind that is yoked to the traid of the strands, sattva etc.  [those actions that]  have been simply ruined  [by that mind], are binding and not otherwise.  this is the idea here.   therefore, the acts like sacrifice etc., and the acts, like aciring  [wealth] etc., for that purpose, have to be perfored as being inevitable as long as the body exists.   or, perhaps, the word  om  conveys  [with regard to the brahman]  the idea of that in which the entire universe has been totally calmed down.  tat conveys the idea of that of the nature of sovereign  independence of will, which is nothing but comprehending the rising waves in the form of the universe.  and the word sat denotes the act of manifestation by the brahman - even though it is complete in itself - as [the universe]  having  varied nature, a manifestation that  causes differences  (or duality) expanding under the weight of its sovereign  independenc of will.  hence it has been said  'in the sense of manifesting as beings and in the sense of manifesting  perfectly  [sat is employed].'  thus, having is front  [as a casue]  that aspect  (the soul) of  highly tranil nature , and having in the  centre that aspect which is well connected with desire-waves viz., the desire to make gift, the desire to perform sacrifice and the desire to observe penance , this final body radiates  (or dances)  filled with a group of activities, such as  offering gift, performing sacrifice and observing austerity, and of what are conducive to them.  this triad is indeed simultaneously the inherent nature of the unhindered one (the soul).  so, what fruit could be there ?  and to whom ?  how ?  whence ?  where ?  and by what means ?\t\t\t\t  the act of person, with no faith, is an act of the tamas and bears no fruit in any way and bears fruit which is nothing but the labour undertaken in bringing together the band of means [of those acts].  hence one should not on any account remain faithless.  this is being said now :",
  "and sthitih, steadfastness , that is yajne, in sacrifice, in the act of sacrifice , the steadfastness that is tapasi, in austerity , and the steadfastness that is dane, in charity , that ucyate, is spoken of , sat iti, as sat, by learned persons. and eva, even , the karma, action , tad-arthiyam, meant for these-for sacrifice, charity and austerity, or for him whose names are under discussion, i.e. for god , is eva, verily , abhidhiyate, called , sat iti, as sat (good). thus, in this way, the acts of sacrifice, austerity, etc., even when they are devoid of sattva and goodness, become good and endued with sattva by he use of the three names of brahman with faith. and as regards those (sacrifice etc.), since in all cases everything is performed with a predominance of faith, therefore-",

  "offerings etc., when performed without faith, are asat (i.e., unreal, bereft of efficiency), although they might be what has been enjoined by the sastras. why so?  because it is naught here or hereafter , it will not lead to release nor to any desirable result in samsara",

  "the man of renunciation, pervaded by purity, intelligent, and with his doubts cut asunder, does not hate a disagreeable work nor is he attached to an agreeable one",
  "the wise man who has attained purity, whose doubts are solved, who is filled with the spirit of self-abnegation, does not shrink from action because it brings pain, nor does he desire it because it brings pleasure",
  "the man of relinishment, who is well possessed of the sattva, is wise and has his doubts destroyed-he hates not the unskilled action and clings not to the skilled action",
  "one who has abandoned, who is imbued with sattva, who is wise, whose doubts have been dispelled - such a person hates not disagreeable acts nor clings to agreeable ones",
  "the man of renunciation who has become imbued with sattva, who is wise and freed from doubts, does not hate unbefitting action, nor does he become attached to befitting activity",
  "thus, 'filled with sattva,' endowed with right knowledge, i.e., with the knowledge of the reality as it is, and as a conseence of it 'having all doubts shattered' - he alone becomes a renouncer of attachment to work and the fruits of work. he 'neither hates works productive of harmful effects,' nor 'loves others productive of worldly prosperity.' disagreeable acts are fraught with undesirable fruits , and agreeable acts bring about desirable results such as heaven, sons, cows, food etc. on account of his renouncing all results other than the brahman and on account of his renouncing the sense of agency, he shows neither love nor hatred for above-mentioned types of works. here 'sinful acts having undesirable fruits' are only such acts as are inadvertently performed. for it has been taught in the srutis that nor turning away from bad conduct is antagonistic to the production of knowledge. 'but one who has not ceased from bad conduct, who is not tranil, is not composed, is not of peaceful mind, cannot obtain him by knowledge' (ka. u., 1.2.24). thus, 'the abandonment' according to the sastras is renunciation of the sense of agency, attachment and fruits of actions, and not total relinishment of actions as such.  he explains this further:",
  "na devesti, he does not hate , akusalam, unbefitting , karma, action, rites and duties meant for desired results-with the idea, 'what is the usefulness of this which is a cause of transmigration through fresh embodiment?' na anusajjate, he does not become attached to , kusale, befitting activity, daily obligatory duties, by thinking that this is the cause of liberation by virtue of its being the cause of purification of the mind, rise of knowledge and steadfastness in it. that is to say, he does not entertain any liking even for it, because he finds no purpose in it. who, again, is he? tyagi, the man of renunciation, who has become so by having given up attachment and rewards of action in the manner stated above. he is a tyagi who performs nityakarmas by relinishing attachment to those acts and (their) results. again, it is being stated as to when that person does not hate an unbefitting act and does not become attached to a befitting activity: when he has become sattva-samavistah, imbued with sattva, i.e., when he is filled with, possessed of, sattva, which is the means to the knowledge that discriminates between the self and the not-self , and hence medhavi, wise-endowed with intelligence (medha), intuitive experience, characterized as knowledge of the self , one possessed of that is medhavai (wise)- , and owing to the very fact of being wise, chinnasamsayah, freed from doubts-one whose doubts created by ignorance have been sundered, one who is freed from doubts by his firm conviction that nothing but abiding in the ture nature of the self is the supreme means to the highest good. the person competent (for rites and duties) who, having gradually become purified in mind through the practice of karma-yoga in the way described above, has realized as his own self the actionless self, which is devoid of modifications like birth etc., he, '৷৷.having given up all actions mentally, remaining at without doing or causing (others) to do anything at all' (cf. 5.13), attains steadfastness in knowledge, which is characterized as 'actionless-ness'. in this way, the purpose of the aforesaid karma-yoga has been stated through the present verse. on the other hand, since, for the unenlightened person-who, while being alified (for rites and duties), holds on to the body owing to the erroneous conception that the body is the self, and who has the firm conviction, 'i am the agent,' because of the persistence of his idea that the self is the agent-it is not possible to renounce actions totally, therefore he has competence only for performing enjoined duties by giving up fruits of actions. but he is not to renounce them (actions). in order to point out this idea the lord says:",
  "verily, it is not possible for an embodied being to abandon actions entirely , but he who relinishes the rewards of actions is verily called a man of renunciation",
  "but since those still in the body cannot entirely avoid action, in their case abandonment of the fruit of action is considered as complete renunciation",
  "indeed, to relinish actions entirely is not possible for a body-bearing one , but whosoever relinishes the fruits  of actions, he is said to be a man of [true] relinishment",
  "for, it is impossible for one who bears a body to abandon actions entirely. but he who gives up the fruits of works, is called the abandoner",
  "since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body to give up actions entirely, therefore he, on the other hand, who renounces results on actions is called a man of renunciation",
  "it is impossible for one who has a body and has to nourish it. 'to abandon action entirely' , for eating, drinking etc., reired for nourshing the body and other acts connected therewith are unavoidable. and for the same reason the five great sacrifices etc., are also indispensable. he who has given up the fruits of the five great sacrifices, is said to have renounced , this is referred to in the srutis such as:  'only through renunciation do some obtain immortality' (ma. na., 8.14). renunciation of fruits of actions is illustrative , it implies much more. it implies one who has renounced the fruits, agency and attachment to works, as the topic has been begun with the declaration: 'for abandonment (tyaga) is declard to be of three kinds' (18.4).  this statement may be estioned in the following manner: 'agnihotra, the full moon and new moon sacrifices, jyotistoma etc., and also the five great sacrifices are enjoined by the sastras only for the attainment of their results like heaven. they are not purposeless. even the injunction with regard to obligatory and occasional ceremonies is enjoined because they yield results, as implied in the following passage:  'for householders, prajapatya ceremony' (v.p., 1.6.37). therefore, as the performance of actions has to be understood as a means for attaining their respective results, the accruing of agreeable and disagreeable results is inevitable, even though they are performed without any desire for fruits, just as a seed sown must grow into a tree and bear fruit. hence, actions ought not to be performed by an aspirant for release, because the results are incompatible with release. sri krsna answers such objections:",
  " niscayam etc.  upto abhidhiyate.  the conclusion here is  this :  due to the manifoldness of the nature of the strands, that have been defined earlier, the act of relinishment itself is performed with a certain mental disposition which is a modification of the sattva, the rajas and the tamas (the strands).  because it reflects  (is contaminated by)  the nature of the person having the same (the said mental dispositon),  what is called the real (unalloyed)  relinishment is the performance of the actions  by the knowers of the supreme brahman by giving up desire to achieve fruits and by avoiding the craving and hatred on account of their eanimity to [the pairs of opposites like]  success and failure etc.  that is why [the bhagavat] says :  'by the act of relinishment born of the rajas or of the tamas  (strands), no connection with the fruit  [of relinishment] is attained'.  however, for an act of relinishing, born of the sattva (strand), there is the fruit in the form of honouring the purport of the scriptures.  the application of the term  'relinishment'  stands to reason, in fact, only in the case of a sage who has relinished his holding on the multitude of the strands",
  "deha-bhrta, for one who holds on to a body-one who maintains (bibharti) a body (deha) is called a deha-bhrt. one who has self-indentification with the body is called a deha-bhrt, but not a so a man of discrimination , for he has been excluded from the eligibility for agentship by such texts as, 'he who knows this one is indestructible৷৷.' etc. hence, for that unenlightened person who holds on to the body, he, since , it is na, not , sakyam, possible , tyaktum, to give up, renounce , karmani, actions , asesatah, entirely, totally , therefore the ignorant person who is competent (for rites and duties), yah, who , tu, on the other hand , karma-phala-tyagi, renounces results of actions, relinishes only the hankering for the results of actions while performing the nityakarmas , sah, he , is abhidhiyate, called , tyagi iti, a man of renunciation-even though he continues to be a man of rites and duties. this is said by way of eulogy. therefore total renunciation of actions is possible only for one who has realized the supreme truth, who does not hold on to the body, and who is devoid of the idea that the body is the self. again, what is that purpose which is accomplished through renunciation of all actions? this is being stated:",
  "the threefold fruit of action (evil, good and mixed) accrues after death to the non-abandoners, but never to the abandoners",
  "for those who cannot renounce all desire, the fruit of action hereafter is threefold - good, evil, and partly good and partly evil. but for him who has renounced, there is none",
  "the three-fold fruit of action, viz., the undesired, the desired and the mixed, accrues [even] after death ot those who are not men of relinishment, but never to those who are men of renunciation",
  "undesirable, desirable and mixed - thus threefold is the fruit of work that accrues after death to those who have not renounced , but to those who have renounced, none whatsoever",
  "the threefold results of actions-the undesirable, the desirable, and the mixed-accrues after death to those who do not resort to renunciation, but never to those who resort to monasticism",
  "the 'undesirable result' is naraka etc., 'the desirable' is heaven etc., 'the mixed' is sons, cows, food etc., which are combined with some undesirable results. those who have not renounced, namely, those who are devoid of renunciation of agency, possessiveness and fruits - they meet with threefold conseences after death. the meaning of 'after death' (pretya) may be understood as subseent to the performance of actions. but 'to those who have renounced, none whatsoever,' viz., to those who have relinished the sense of agency etc., no such results antagonistic to release accrue.  here the purport is this:  agnihotra, the great sacrifices etc. are obligatory throughout life and are reired for attaining the objects of desire , but in regard to release their application is different. though externally they appear to be the same in their nature in both the conditions, they are different in their fruits by virtue of difference in application. their application to release is seen in such texts as 'the brahmanas desire to know him by the study of the vedas, by sacrifices, by gifts, by austerities conjoined with fasting' (br. u., 4.4.22). here the performance of actions without sense of agency is enforced. such giving up agency etc., are relevant only with regard to acts that are actually performed. thus sannyasa or renouncing of this kind is established in the sastras. the same is also called tyaga or giving up.  sri krsna now explains the manner of realising that one is non-agent, by attributing all agency to god, who is the supreme person and the inner ruler, by cultivating this attitude, an aspirant can attain the renunciation of possessiveness with regard to actions and also their fruits. for it is the supreme person who performs all actions through the individual selves who belong to him. the organs, bodies and pranas of embodied beings are his. they exist for the sake of his own sport as the only purpose. therefore, even the appeasement of hunger etc., and such other acts which affect the life of the individual souls and their works constitute only the means for accomplishing that purpose, namely, the sport of the highest purusa himself. the purport of the argument is this:  the analogy of seeds producing the tree and its fruits is not applicable to the actions of release-seekers. their actions may look like those of fruit-seekers externally. but as mentally they do not entertain any such purpose, the conseence of their actions can be ite different. the purpose served by their actions is only affording sport for the supreme being",
  "anistam etc.  to those who are not men of relinishment :  to those who are full of [desire for]  fruit.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  even at the stage of mundane life, where all the five factors do exist for actions, those persons, blind with their ignorance, obstinately burden their own self with the entire load of agency.  hence they fetter their own self with their own thinking.  but, in fact, there is no bondage for him (the self).  this is now being taught as :",

  "yasya, he who, the person whose intellect is refined by the instructions of the scriptures and the teachers, and reason , who has na, not , ahankrtah bhavah, the feeling of egoism, in whom does not occur the notion in the form, 'i am the agent' , i.e., he who sees thus: 'these five, viz locus etc. (14), imagined in the self through ignorance, are verily the agents of all actions , not i. but i am the absolute, unchanging witness of their functions, 'without vita force, without mind, pure, superior to the (other) superior immutable (maya)' (mu. 2.1.1)' , yasya, whose , buddhih, intellect, the internal organ, which is the limiting adunct of the self , is na, not , lipyate, tainted, does not become regretful thinking, 'i have done this , as a result, i shall enter into hell' , whose intellect does not become thus tainted, he has a good intellect and he perceives (rightly). api, even , hatva, by killing , iman, these , lokan, creatures, i.e. all living beings , sah he , does not hanti, kill-he does not perform the act of killing , nor does he nibadhyate, become bound, nor even does he become connected with its result, the fruit of an unrighteous action. objection: even if this be a eulogy, is it not contradictory to say, 'even by killing he does not kill'? reply: this defect does not arise , for this becomes logical from the ordinary and the enlightened points of view. by adopting the empirical point of view (which consists in thinking), 'i am the slayer', by identifying the body with the self, the lord says, 'even by killing' , and, by taking his stand on the supreme truth as explained above (the lord says), 'he does not kill, nor does he become bound'. thus both these surely become reasonable. objection , is it not that the self certainly does act in combination with the locus etc., which conclusion follows from the use of the word kevala (absolute) in the text, 'the absolute self as the agent' (16)? reply: there is not such fault, because, the self being changeless by nature, there is no possiblity of its becoming united with the locus etc. for it is only a changeful entity that can possibly be united with another, or come to have agentship through combination. but, for the changeless self there can be no combination with anything whatsoever. hence, agentship through combination is not logical. therefore, the absoluteness of the self being natural, the word kevalam is merely a reiteration of an established fact. and the changelessness of the self is well known from the upanisads, the smrtis and logic. as to that, in the gita itself this has been established more than once in such texts as, 'it is said that৷৷.this is unchangeable' (2.25), 'actions are being done by the gunas themselves' (see 3.27), 'this ৷৷.supreme self does not act৷৷.although existing in the body' (13.31), and in the upanisads also in such texts as, 'it thinks, as it were, and shakes, as it were' (br. 4.3.7). and from the standpoint of reason also, the royal path is to hold that the true nature of the self is that it is partless, independent of others and changeless. even if mutability (of the self) be accepted, it should have a change that is its own. the functions of the locus etc. cannot be attributed to the agency of the self. indeed, an action done by someone else cannot be imputed to another by whom it has not been done! as for what is imputed (on somody) through ignorance, that is not his. as the ality of silver is not of nacre, or as surface or dirt attributed through ignorance to the sky by foolish people is not of the sky, similarly, the changes in the locus etc. also are verily their own, and not of the self. hence it has been well said that the enlightened person 'does not kill, nor is he bound', becuase of the absence of his being tainted by the idea that actions are done by himself. [some translate this portion thus: '৷৷.because of the absence of the thought 'i am doing', and also due to the taintlessness of the mind' , or, '৷৷.in the absence of egotism and of all taint in the mind'.-tr.] after having declared, 'this one does not kill, nor is it killed' (2.19) , having stated the immutability of the self through such texts as, 'never is this one born' (2.20) , etc., which adduce the reason for this , having briefly stated at the commencement of the scripture-in, 'he who knows this one as indestructible' (2.21)-that the enlightened man has no eligibility for rites and duties , and having deliberated in various places on that (cessation) which has been mooted in the middle (of the scripture), the lord, by way of summarizing the purport of the scripture, concludes here by saying that the enlightened person 'does not kill, nor does he become bound.' if this be so, then it becomes established that the three kinds of results of actions, viz the undesirable etc., do not accrue to the monks, since it is reasonable that, because of the illogicality of their entertaining the idea of being embodied, all actions resulting from ignorance become abandoned (by them). and hence, as a conseence of a reversal of this, it becomes inevitable that the results do accrue to others. thus, this is how the purport of the scripture gita has been summed up. in order that this which is the essence of the teachings of all the vedas should be. understood after deliberation by the learned ones possessing a sharp intellect, it has been explained by us in accordance with the scriptures and reasoning, in various places by dealing with it topically. thereafter, now is being stated what promts actions:",

  "some kavayah, learned ones , viduh, know , sannyasam, sannyasa, the meaning of the word sannyasa, the non-performance of what comes as a duty , to be the nyasam, giving up , karmanam, of actions , kamyanam, done with a desire for reward, e.g. horse-sacrifice etc. sarva-karma-phala-tyagah, abandonment of the results of all actions, means the giving up of the results accruing to oneself from all actions- the daily obligatory and the occasional (nitya and naimittika) that are performed. vicaksanah, the adepts, the learned ones , prahuh, call, speak of that , as tyagam, tyaga, as the meaning of the word tyaga. even if 'the giving up of actions for desired results' or 'the abandonment of results' be the intended meaning, in either case the one meaning of the words sannyasa and tyaga amounts only to tyaga (giving up) , they do not imply distinct categories as do the words 'pot' and 'cloth'. objection: well, is it not that they say the daily obligatory (nitya) and the occasional (naimittika) rites and duties have no results at all? how is the giving up of their results spoken of-like the abandoning of a son of a barren woman?! reply: this defect does not desire. it is the intention of the lord that the nitya-karmas (daily obligatory duties) also have results , for the lord will say, 'the threefold results of actions-the undesirable, the desirable and the mixed-accrue after death to those who do not resort to tyaga', and also, 'but never to those who resort to sannyasa (monks)' (12). indeed, by showing that, it is only in the case of sannyasins (monks) alone that there is no connection with the results of actions, the lord asserts in, '৷৷.accrue after death to those who do not resort to tyaga (renunciation)' (abid.), that the result of daily obligatory (nitya) duties accrue to those who are not sannyasins (monks)",

  "eke, some , manisinah, learned ones, subscribing to the views of the sankhyas and others , prahuh, say , that dosavat, beset with evil (as it is) ,-what is it?- karma, action, all actions, becuase they are the cause of bondage , tyajyam, should be given up even by those who are eligible for actions (rites and duties). or, it (action) is to be given up dosavat, just as defects such as attachment etc. are renounced. ca and, in that very context , apare, others , (say) that yajana-dana-tapah-karma, the practice of sacrifice, charity and auterity , na tyajyam, should not be given up.  these alternatives are with regard to only those who are alified for action, but not with regard to the monks who are steadfast in knowledge and have gone beyond the stages of life. this discussion is not concerned with those who are held to be outside the scope of eligibility for action in the assertion (by the lord), 'the steadfastness in the yoga of knowledge by men of realization was spoken of by me in the days of yore' (see 3.3). objection: well, just as those who are alified for rites and duties and who have their distinct steadfastness are being considered here in the chapter summarizing the entire scripture, though they have been dealt with earlier in '৷৷.through the yoga of action for the yogis' (3.3), similarly, let even the men of realization who are steadfast in knowledge be considered here. reply: no, because it is not logical that their renunciation should result from delusion and sorrow (cf. 7 and 8). the men of realization do not perceive in the self the sorrows arising from physical torment , for it has been shown that desire etc. are attributes only of the field (body) (see 13.6). therefore, they do not renounce action but of fear for physical trouble and pain. nor do they perceive actions in the self, on account of which they should give up obligatory duties out of delusion. in fact, they renounce with the conviction that 'action belongs to the organs' (see 3.28) , 'i certainly do not do anything' (see 5.8) , for, the mode of renunciation of an enlightened person was shown in, '৷৷.having given up all actions mentally' (5.13). therefore, those others who are alified for rites and duties, who are unelightened about the self, and for whom renunciation is possible out of delusion and from fear of physical trouble, are alone condemned as persons who, being possessed of tamas and rajas, resort to renunciation. and this is done with a veiw to eulogizing the renunciation of the results of rites and duties by the unenlightened men of action. besides, the men of renunciation in the real sense have been particularly pointed out in, 'who has renounced ever undertaking,' 'who is silent, content with anything, homeless, steadyminded' (12.16, 19), and also (while determining) the characteristics of one who has transcended the gunas (chapter 14). the lord will further say, '৷৷.which is the supreme consummation of knowledge' (50). therefore the monks steadfast in knowledge are not intended to be spoken of here. it is only the abandoning of the results of action which, by virtue of its being imbued with the ality of sattva, is spoken of as sannyasa in contrast to the renunciation of actions which is possessed of tamas etc. , it is not sannyasa in the primary-sense-the renunciation of all actions. objection: according to the reason shown in the text, 'since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body to give up actions entirely' (11), may it not be argued that the actions entirely' (11), may it not be argued that the word sannyasa is certainly used in the primary sense because it is impossible to abandon all works? reply: no, for the next adducing the reason is meant for eulogy. just as, 'from renunciation immediately (follows) peace' (12.12), is a mere eulogy of renunciation of the fruits of action, it having been enjoined on arjuna who was unenlightened and incapable of undertaking the various alternatives (paths) as stated earlier, so also is this sentence, 'since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body to give up actions entirely' (11), meant for eulogizing the renunciation of the resorts of all actions. no one can point an exception to the proposition that 'having given up all actions mentally, (the embodied man of self-control) continues happily৷৷.without doing or causing (others) to do anything at all' (see 5.13). therefore these alternative veiws regarding sannyasa and tyaga are concerned only with those who are alified for rites and duties. but the enlightened ones who have realized the supreme truth are competent only for steadfastness in knowledge, which is characterized by renunciation of all actions , not for anything else. hence, they do not come within the purview of the alternative veiws. thus has this been pointed out by us in connection with the text, '৷৷.he who knows this one as indestructible৷৷.'

'heaven and such other results arising from acts do not belong to me.' renunciation of acts is complete abandonment of the sense of possession in regard to one's acts. this sense of possession is of the following nature:  'those acts are mine on account of their being the means for fruits which are to be mine.' renunciation referring to agency is the renunciation of agency of oneself by ascribing the agency to the lord of all",

  "there is no being on earth or again in heaven among the gods, that is liberated from the three alities born of nature",
  "there is nothing anywhere on earth or in the higher worlds which is free from the three qualities - for they are born of nature",

  "there is no sattva or creature born either among men etc., on the earth or among the gods in heaven, from brahma down to immobile things, and having their basis in prakrti, that is free from the dominance of the three gunas of prakrti.  'tyaga', which has been determined as forming the means for release in the sruti texts like 'by tyaga alone do they attain immortality' (ma. na., 8.14), is of the same meaning as of the word 'sannyasa'. it is rooted in the relinishment of the sense of agency in actions that are being performed.  the relinishment of the results and of possessiveness in actions, and the relinguishing of agency are to be gained by ascribing the agency to the supreme person. as all these are the effects of the increase of sattva-guna, the differences of the effects of sattva, rajas and tamas have been described at length with a view to instruct that sattva is to be cultivated.  now sri krsna, with a view to inculcate that actions done including their fruits, as a means to release and attainment of him, must be of the nature of the worship of the supreme person, and that the fruit thereof is the attainment of him - describes the actions obligatory for the alified classes of the people such as brahmanas, differentiated by virtue of the natural alities arising from the gunas such as sattva, as also the occupations prescribed for those classes",
  "na tad asti etc.  in this manner, the agent, the object and the instrument, the intellect and content, and happiness are classified under different heads of the sattva etc.  because they have a mutual relationship of  subordinate-and-principal or of the oppressed-and-opressor or of the togetherness , becuase they have modifications occuring either together or in a  specific seence , and because they, on that account, have varieties beyond all counting , they are capable of bringing forth fruits  (results) of umpteen variety. this (statement)  logically demonstrates in detail the uncomprehensibility of actions (their results)  which has been indicated earlier  (above iv, 17ff.).  all these beings, starting from the gods down to the immovables, do not transcend the relation with the traid of the strands.  indeed it has been said -   'commencing from brahma (personal god) down to the  [insignificant] worm, no one is really happy , all, without exception, having desire to live, undertake different  acts of agitation  (or commit different frauds to appear to be happy).'   indeed the real happiness is [only] to him whose mind has gone beyond the strands and not to anyone else.  this is what is intended here.\t\t  so far, the three-fold nature of each of the six items and also of the content etc., has been explained.  'among them, he who is occupied with the group of the sattva (strand) and who has attained the divine wealth is fit for the subject under study ,  and you are of that sort' - telling in this manner, arjuna has been encouraged.   now the following is declared :  if you engage yourself in the action with this reslove for correct knowledge, then because of  your undertaking of your own righteous action and because of your sanctity through wisdom, there is no bondage of aciton for you.  on the other hand, if you don't follow this,  [even] then there must necessarily be some activity in you , because  your birth itself stands to that effect.  since, being controlled by its own intrinsic nature, everything, though it may have, for a short while, its nature concealed due to some fault, regains its own nature that becomes perceivable when the concealing agent disappears.  for example, the nature of the castes is of this nature.  thus when an effort necessarily takes place, there would be [for its agent] its fruit.  this [the bhagavat] says-",

  "of brahmanas, kshatriyas and vaisyas, as also of sudras, o arjuna, the duties are distributed according to the alities born of their own nature",
  "o arjuna! the duties of spiritual teachers, the soldiers, the traders and the servants have all been fixed according to the dominant quality in their nature",

  "o scorcher of enemies, the duties of the brahmanas, the ksatriyas and the vaisyas, as also of the sudras have been fully classified according to the gunas born from nature",
  "the nature of brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas, and sudras are due to their respective inherent dispositions. the meaning is that their past karma has been the cause of determining births as brahmanas etc. the sattva and other gunas are the result of such karma. the sattva-guna is born from the inherent nature of the brahmana becoming dominant by suppressing the alities of rajas and tamas. the ality of rajas originates from the inherent nature of the ksatriyas becoming dominant by suppressing alities of sattva and tamas. tamoguna arises from the inherent nature of the vaisya, becoming dominant in a little way by suppressing sattva and rajas. the duties and works assigned to them according to the gunas constituting their inherent nature, are expounded and allotted by the sastras in the order described. for the sastras analyse that the brahmanas etc., possess such and such attributes and such and such are their duties and occupations",

'born from nature' means 'born of these three gunas. in accordnace with these the duties such as control of the internal organs, etc. of the brahmanas and others have been classified. or (the meaning is): the source of the nature of the brahmanas is the ality of sattva. similarly, the source of the nature of the ksatriyas is rajas, with sattva as a subordinate (ality) , the source of the nature of the vaisyas is rajas, with tamas as the subordinate (ality) , the source of the nature of the sudras is tamas, with rajas as the subordinate (ality) , for the natures of the four are seen to be tranillity. lordliness, industriousness and dullness respectively. or, svabhava (nature) means the (individual) tendencies of creatures earned in their past lives, which have become manifest in the present life for yielding their own results. the gunas which have that svabhava as their source (prabhava) are svabhava-prabhavah gunah. since the manifestation of the gunas cannot logically be uncaused, therefore a specific cause [i.e. the tendencies are the efficient cause, and nature is the material cause.] has been posited by saying that nature is the cause. thus, the duties such as control of the internal organs etc. have been classified in keeping with the effects of the gunas, sattva, rajas and tamas, which are born of nature, born of prakrti. objection: well, are not the duties like controlling the internal organs etc. of the brahmanas and others classified and enjoined by the scriptures? why is it said that they are classified according to the gunas sattva etc.? reply: this objection is not valid. for, the duties like controlling the internal organs etc. of the brahmanas and others have been classified even by the scriptures verily in keeping with the specific alities sattva etc. , certainly, not without reference to the gunas. hence, though the duties have been divided by the scriputres, they are said to have been classified according to the gunas. which, again, are those duties? they are being spoken of:",

'arjava' is straightforwardness expressing itself in correct outward manifestation to others in consonance with one's own mind. 'jnana' is knowledge about the real nature of the higher and lower truths. 'vijnana' is the knowledge pertaining to exceptional attributes belonging to the supreme reality. 'astikya' or faith is firm conviction in the truth of all things enjoined in the vedas. the meaning is that it is unshakable by any reason whatever.  'astikya' is positive conviction in the truth to the following effect:  (1) the lord vasudeva, the supreme person, is signified by the term, supreme brahman. (2) he is devoid of even the slightest trace or evil. (3) he possesses countless hosts of auspicious and excellent attributes such as knowledge, strength etc., boundless and natural. (4) to reveal his nature is the sole purpose of the whole of vedas and the vedanta and he can be known only through them. (5) he is the sole cause of the universe (6) he is the foundation of the entire universe. (7) he is the actuator of all. (8) all actions taught in the vedas form his worship. (9) when worshipped through them, he confers fruits known as dharma, artha, kama and moksa.  that such is the meaning has been declared in the following text:  'indeed i am to be known from all the vedas' (15.15) , 'i am the origin of all , from me proced everything' (10.8), 'all this is strung on me' (7.7), 'knowing me as the enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities ৷৷. he attains peace' (10.29), there is nothing greater than myself, arjuna (7.7) 'he from whom proceeds the activity of all beings and by whom all this is pervaded - by worshipping him with his duty, will a man reach perfection' (18.46) , and 'he who knows me as unborn, without a beginning and the great lord of the worlds ৷৷.'

  "'agriculture' is cultivation to produce crops. the meaning of 'cattle breeding' is the protection and rearing of cattle. 'trade' is the activity causing the amassing of wealth through buying and selling. this is the duty of vaisya born of his inherent nature.  the duty of a sudra, born of his inherent nature, is service to the three orders mentioned earlier.  all these have been described to stress that the occupational activities of the four stations are auxiliary to the performance of sacrifices etc., which are ordained by the sastra. sacrifices etc., are common to the first three stations. control of the senses etc., are common to those who, among the first three stations, are anxious for release. as a brahmana possesses preponderance of sattva, and as the control of the senses, mind etc., can be performed by him easily and naturally, control of the senses etc., have been prescribed as his duty. as control of the mind, senses etc., can be performed only with difficulty by the ksatriyas and the vaisyas owing to the preponderance of rajas and tamas respectively in them, these have not been stated as their duty. the occupation of a brahmana is officiating as priest in sacrifices, teaching the vedas and receiving gifts. the occupation of a ksatriya is protecting the people and that of the vaisyas is farming etc., as mentioned before. the duty and occupation of the sudra is service to the three stations",

(5.8), understands that all actions proceed from brahman (prakrti) , renounces all attachment while engaging himself in all actions, reflecting, 'i am doing nothing.' such a person, though existing in contact with prakrti, is not contaminated by sin which is the result of the wrong identification of the atman with prakrti and is the cause of bondage. just as a lotus leaf is not wetted by water, actions do not affect or defile a person with sin, if he is free from such identification with the body",

  "so, one should not relinish one's works, understanding that they are natural, are easy to perform and not liable to negligence. such thoughts coupled with the idea that there are imperfections in them should not lead you to abandon them. the meaning is that though one is fit for jnana yoga, one should perform karma yoga only. all enterprises, be they of karma or jnana, are indeed enveloped by imperfections, by pain, as fire by smoke. but still there is this difference:  karma yoga is easy and does not involve negligence, but jnana yoga is contrary to this",
  "kaunteya, o son of kunti , na tyajet, one should not give up ,-what?-the karma, duty , sahajam, to which one is born, which devolves from the very birth , api, even though , it be sadosam, faulty, consisting as it is of the three gunas. hi, for , sarva-arambhah, all undertakings (-whatever are begun are arambhah, i.e. 'all actions', according to the context-), being constituted by the three gunas (-here, the fact of being constituted by the three gunas is the cause-) , are avrtah, surrounded , dosena, with evil , iva, as , , agnih, fire , is dhumena, with smoke, which comes into being concurrently. one does not get freed from evil by giving up the duty to which one is born-called one's own duty-, even though (he may be) fulfilling somody else's duty. another's duty, too, is fraught with fear. the meaning is: since action cannot be totally given up by an unelightened person, therefore he should not relinish it. opponent: well, is it that one should not abandon action because it cannot be given up completely, or is it because evil [evil resulting from discarding daily obligatory duties.] follows from the giving up of the duty to which one is born? counter-objection: what follows from this? opponent: if it be that the duty to which one is born should not be renounced because it is impossible to relinish it totally, then the conclusion that can be arrived at is that complete renunciation (of duty) is surely meritorious! counter-objection: truly so. but, may it not be that total relinishment is itself an impossibility? is a person ever-changeful like the gunas of the sankhyas, or is it that action itself is the agent, as it is in the case of the momentary five [rupa (from), vedana (feeling), vijnana (momentary consciousness), sanjna (notion), samskara (mental impressions)-these have only momentary existence. in their case there can be no distinction between action and agent, simply due to the fact of their being momentary.] forms of mundane consciousness propounded by the buddhists? in either case there can be no complete renunciation of action. then there is also a third standpoint (as held by the vaisesikas): when a thing acts it is active, and inactive when that very thing does not act. if this be the case here, it is possible to entirely give up actions. but the speciality of the third point of view is that a thing is not ever-changing, nor is action itself the agent. what then? a nonexistent action originates in an existing thing, and an existing action gets destroyed. the thing-in-itself continues to exist along with its power (to act), and that itself is the agent. this is what the followers of kanada say. [their view is that agentship consists in 'possessing the power to act', not in being the substratum of action.] what is wrong with this point of view. vedantin: the defect indeed lies in this that, this veiw is not in accord with the lord's view. objection: how is this known? vedantin: since the lord as said, 'of the unreal there is no being৷৷.,' etc. (2.16). the view of the followers of kanada is, indeed, this that the non-existent becomes existent, and the existent becomes nonexistent. objection: what defect can there be if it be that this view, even though not the view of the lord, yet conforms to reason? vedantin: the answer is: this is surely faulty since it contradicts all valid evidence. objection: how? vedantin: as to this, if things like a dvyanuka (dyad of two anus, atoms) be absolutely nonexistent before origination, and after origination continue for a little while, and again become absolutely non-existent, then, in that acase, the existent which was verily nonexistent comes into being, [here ast. adds, 'sadeva asattvam apadyate, that which is verily existent becomes nonexistent'.-tr.] a non-entity becomes an entity, and an entity becomes a non-entity! if this be the view, then the non-enity that is to take birth is comparable to the horns of a hare before it is born, and it comes into being with the help of what are called material (inherent), non-mateial (non-inherent) and efficient causes. but it cannot be said that nonexistence has origination in this way, or that it depends on some cause, since this is not seen in the case of nonexistent things like horns of a hare, etc. if such things as pot etc. which are being produced be of the nature of (potentially) existing things, then it can be accepted that they originate by depending on some cause which merely manifests them. [according to vedanta, before origination a thing, e.g. a pot, remains latent in its material cause, clay for instance, with its name and form unexpressed, and it depends on other causes for the manifestation of name and form.] moreover, if the nonexistent becomes existent, and the existent becomes non-existent, then nobody will have any faith while dealing with any of the means of valid knowledge objects of such knowledge, because the conviction will be lacking that the existent is existent and the nonexistent is nonexistent! further, when they speak of origination, they (the viasesikas) hold that such a thing as a dvyanuka (dyad) comes to have relationship with its own (material) causes (the two atoms) and existence, and that it is nonexistent before origination , but later on, depending on the operation of its own causes, it becomes connected with its own causes, viz the atoms, as also with existence, through the inherent (or inseparable) relationship called samavaya. after becoming connected, it becomes an existent thing by its inherent relationship with its causes. [the effect (dyad) has inherent relationship with existence after its material causes (the two atoms) come into association.] it has to be stated in this regard as to how the nonexistent can have an existent as its cuase, or have relationship with anything. for nobody can establish through any valid means of knowledge that a son of a barren woman can have any existence or relationship or cause. vaisesika: is it not that relationship of a non-existent thing is not at all established by the vaisesikas? indeed, what is said by them is that only existent entities like dvyanuka etc. have the relationship in the form of samavaya with their own causes. vedantin: no, for it is not admitted (by them) that anything has existence before the (samavaya) relationship (occurs). it is surely not held by the vaisesikas that a pot etc. have any existence before the potter, (his) stick, wheel, etc. start functioning. nor do they admit that clay itself takes the shape of a pot etc. as a result, it has to be admitted (by them) as the last aternative that nonexistence itself has some relationship! vaisesika: well, it is not contradictory even for a nonexistent thing to have the relationship in the form of inherence. vedantin: no, because this is not seen in the case of a son of a barren woman etc. if the antecedent nonexistence (prag-abhava) of the pot etc. alone comes into a relationship with its own (material) cause, but not so the nonexistence of the son of a barren woman etc. though as nonexistence both are the same, then the distinction between the (two) nonexistences has to be explained. through such descriptions ( of abhava, nonexistence) as nonexistence of one, nonexistence of two, nonexistence of all, antecedent nonexistence, nonexistence after destruction, mutual nonexistence and absolute non-existence, nobody can show any distinction (as regards nonexistence itself)! there being no distinction, (therefore, to say that:) 'it is only the 'antecedent nonexistence' of the pot which takes the form of the pot through the (action of) the potter and others, and comes into a relationship with the existing pot-halves which are its own (material) causes and becomes fit for all empirical processes [such as production, destruction, etc.] but the 'nonexistence after destruction' of that very pot does not do so, though it, too, is nonexistence. hence, the 'nonexistence after destruction', etc. [etc. stands for 'mutual nonexistence (anyonya-abhava)' and 'absolute nonexistence (atyanta-abhava)'.] are not fit for any empirical processes, whereas only the 'antecedent nonexistence' of things called dvyanuka etc. is fit for such empirical processes as origination etc.'-all this is incongruous, since as nonexistence it is indistinguishable, as are 'absolute nonexistence' and 'nonexistence after destruction'. vaisesika: well, it is not at all said by us that the 'antecedent nonexistence' becomes existent. vedantin: in that case, the existent itself becomes existent , as for instance, a pot's becoming a pot, or a cloth's becoming a cloth. this, too, like nonexistence becoming existent, goes against valid evidence. even the theory of transformation held by the sankhyas does not differ from the standpoint of the vaisesikas, since they believe in the origination of some new attribute [i.e. in the origination of a transformation that did not exist before.] and its destruction. even if manifestation and disappearance of anything be accepted, yet there will be contradiction with valid means of knowledge as before in the explanation of existence or nonexistence of manifestation and disappearance. hery is also refuted the idea that origination etc. (of an effect) are merely particular states of its cuase. as thelast alternative, it is only the one entity called existence that is imagined variously through ignorance to be possessed of the states of origination, destruction, etc. like an actor (on a stage). this veiw of the lord has been stated in the verse, 'of the unreal there is no being৷৷.' (2.16). for, the idea of existence is constant, while the others are inconstant. objection: if the self be immutable, then how does the 'renunciation of all actions' become illogical? vedantin: if the adjuncts (i.e. body and organs) be real or imagined through ignorance, in either case, action, which is their attribute, is surely superimposed on the self through ignorance. from this point of view it has been said that an unenlightened person is incapable of totally renouncing actions even for a moment (cf. 3.5). the enlightened person, on the other hand, can indeed totally renounce actions when ignorance has been dispelled through illumination , for it is illogical that there can (then) remain any trace of what has been superimposed through ignorance. indeed, no trace remains of the two moons, etc. superimposed by the vision affected by (the disease called) timira when the desease is cured. this being so, the utterance, 'having given up all actions mentally' (5.13), etc. as also, 'being devoted to his own duty' (45) and 'a human being achieves 'success by adoring him through his own duties (46), becomes justifiable. what was verily spoken of as the success arising from karma (-yoga), characterized as the fitness for steadfastness in knowledge,-the fruit of that (fitness), characterized as 'steadfastness in knowledge' consisting in the perfection in the form of the state of one (i.e. a monk) free from duties, has to be stated. hence the (following) verse is begun:",
  "he whose intellect is unattached everywhere, who has subdued his self, from whom desire has fled,  he by renunciation, attains the supreme state of freedom from action",

of the knowledge of brahman. of what kind is it? it is of the same kind as the realization of the self. of what kind is that? as is the self. of what nature is it? as has been described by the lord and the upanisadic texts, and established through reason. objection: is it not that knowledge takes the form of its object? but it is not admitted anywhere that the self is an object, or even that it has form. pseudo-vedantin: is it not heard of in such texts as, 'radiant like the sun' (sv. 3.8), 'of the nature of effulgence' (ch. 3.14.2) and 'self-effulgent' (br. 4.3.9), that the self has form? objection: no, because those sentences are meant for refuting the idea that the self is of the nature of darkness. when the self is denied of possessing forms of substance, ality, etc., the contingency arises of the self's being of the nature of darkness. the sentences, 'radiant like the sun,' etc. are meant for ruting this. and this follows from the specific denial of from by saying, 'formless' (ka. 1.3.15), and from such texts as, 'his form does not exist within the range of vision , nobody sees him with the eye' (ka. 2.3.9: sv. 4.20), 'soundless, touchless' (ka. 1.3.15), etc. which show that the self is not an object of perception. therefore it remains unproved that there can be any knowledge which takes the form of the self. how, then, can there be the knowledge of the self? for, all knowledge that there can be with regard to objects assumes their respective forms. and it has been said that the self has no form. moreover, if both knowledge and the self be formless, then how can there be the consummation [firmness in self-realization.] of the (repeated) contemplation on that (knowledge of the self)? vedantin: no. since it can be established that the self is supremely taintless, pure and subtle, and it can also be established that the intellect can have taintlessness etc. like the self, therefore it stands to reason that the intellect can take a form resembling the consciousness of the self. the mind becomes impressed with the semblance of the intellect , the organs become impressed with the semblance of the mind , and the body becomes impressed with the semblance of hte organs. hence it is that the idea of the body itself being the self is held by ordinary people. the lokayatikas (materialists), who hold that the body is identical with consciousness, say that a person is a body endowed with consciousness , so also there are others who say that the organs are identical with consciousness , there are others who say that the mind is identical with consciousness, and still others who say that the intellect is identical with consciousness. some accept as the self the unmanifest [the inmost ruler (antaryamin), possessing a semblance of consciousness.], called the undifferentiated, which is more internal than that (intellect) and is within the domain of (primordial) ignorance. indeed, in every case, beginning from the intellect to the body, the cause of mis-conceived selfhood is the semblance of the consciousness that is the self. hence, knowledge about the self is not a subject for injunction. what then? only the eradication of the superimposition of name, form, etc., which are not the self, is what has to be undertaken, but not the knowledge of the self that is consciousness. for it is the self which is experienced as possessed of the forms of all the various objects that are superimposed (on it) through ignorance. it is evidently because of this that the buddhists who uphold the view of (momentary) consciousness have concluded that there is no substance at all apart from (momentary) consciousness, and that it is not in need of any other valid proof since they hold that it is self-cognized. therefore, what is to be undertaken is only the elimination of the superimposition on brahman through ignorance, but no effort is needed for knowing brahman (consciousness), for it is ite self-evident! it is because the intellect is distracted by particular appearances of name and form imagined through ignorance that brahman, even though self-evident, easily realizable, nearer than all else and identical with oneself, appears to be concealed, difficult to realize, very far and different, but to those whose intellect has become free from external appearances and who have obtained the grace of a teacher and serenity of mind, there is nothing more blissful, manifest, well known, easily realized and nearer to oneself than this self. and thus it has been declared, 'directly realizable, righteous,' etc. (9.2). however, some wiseacres assert that the intellect cannot comprehend the entity called the self since it is formless , hence, complete steadfastness in knowledge is impossible. this is truly so for those who have not associated with a traditional line of teachers , who have not heard the upanisads , whose intellects are too much engrossed with external objects , and who have not applied themselves diligently to the perfect means of knowledge. for those, on the other hand, who are the opposite of these, it is absolutely impossible to have the idea of reality with regard to empirical objects, which are within the realm of duality involving the knower and the known, because in their case there is no perception of any other thing apart from the consciousness that is the self. we have already said how this is certainly so and not otherwise. it has been stated by the lord also, 'that during which creatures keep awake, it is night to the seeing sage' (2.69). therefore, the cessation of the perception of differences in the form of external things is alone the cause of resting in the reality of the self. for, that which is called the self is never an object which is not well known, attainable, rejectable or acceptable to anyone at any time. were that self to be indeed not self-evident, all activities would become meaningless. [according to ast. the latter portion of this sentence is: svarthah sarvah pravrttayah vyarthah prasajyeran, all activities meant for one's own benefit would become meaningless.-tr.]. for it cannot be imagined that they could be undertaken for unconscious objects like the body etc. besides, it cannot be that pleasure is for pleasure's sake, or that sorrow is for sorrow's sake. moreover, all empirical dealings are meant for culminating in the realization of the self. [according to b.s. 3.4.26, 'on the strength of the upanisadic sanction of sacrifices etc. all religious activities as well are necessary৷৷.', sacrifices etc. are meant for leading to the realization of the self, without which they would become meaningless.] therefore, just as for knowing one's own body there is no need of any other (external) means of knowledge so also there is no need of any other means of knowledge, for the realization of the self which is innermost (in relation to the body etc.). hence it is established that steadfastness in the knowledge of the self is a fact very well known to the discriminating people. even to those who hold that knowledge is formless and not cognized by direct perception, cognition of an object is dependent on knowledge. hence it has to be admitted that knowledge is as immediate as pleasure etc. and this follows also from the impossibility of a desire to know (knowledge). had knowledge been not self-evident, it could have been sought for like any object of knowledge. and in that case, as [this is ast.'s reading , others read tatha.-tr.] a knower seeks to perceive through knowledge such objects of knowledge as pot etc., similarly the knower would have sought to perceive knowledge through another knowledge! but this is not the case. therefore knowledge is ite self-revealing, and for the very same reason the knower also is self-revealed. hence, effort is not needed for knowledge, but only for the removal of the notion of what is not-self. [in place of anatma-buddhi-nivrttau, ast. has 'anatmani atma-buddhi-nivrttau, for the termination of thinking what is not the self as the self'.-tr.] conseently, steadfastness in knowledge is easy of accomplishment. it is being stated how this supreme consummation of knowledge is to be attained:",

  "'having realised the state of brahman,' means having got from revelation an understanding of the nature of the self as consisting of unlimited knowledge and of being a sesa (subservient being) to me. subservience to me has been posited in, 'know that which is other than this (prakrti or lower nature) to be the higher prakrti of mine' (7.5). one who is 'tranil' means one who is not contaminated by various forms of grief (the five klesas of yoga-sutras), and does not grieve about any being other than myself, nor desires anything other than myself. on the other hand, he becomes eally indifferent to all beings other than myself as worthless as straw and attains supreme bhakti for me. he attains 'supreme devotion' to me, which is of the form of an experience which makes me dear beyond all description - me the lord of all, to whom creation, protection and dissolution of the universe is a sport, who is devoid of the slightest trace of evil, who is the sole seat of countless hosts of auspicious attributes which are excellent and unlimited , and who is the ocean of the elixir of beauty , who is the lord of sri , who is lotus-eyed , and who is the self's own lord.  sri krsna declares the fruits of this (devotion):",
  "brahma-bhutah, one who has become brahman, attained brahman through the above process , and prasanna-atma, [prasada means the manifestation of the supreme bliss of the self as a result of the total cessation of all evils. prasanna-atma is one who has attained this in the present life itself.] has attained the blissful self, the indwelling self , na, does not , socati, grieve-does not lament for the loss of something or the lack of some ality in oneself , nor kanksati, desire. by saying 'he does not grieve nor desire', this nature of one who has attained brahman is being restated. for it does not stand to reason that in the case of a knower of brahman there can be any hankering for something unattained. or, (in place of kanksati) teh reading may be na hrsyati, does not become elated. becoming samah, the same , sarvesu bhutesu, towards all being-i.e., he verily judges what is happiness and sorrow in all beings by the same standard as he would apply to himself (cf. 6.32) , but the meaning is not 'seeing the self alike in all beings', for this will be spoken of in (the next verse), 'through devotion he knows me'- , he, the one who is of this kind and steadfast in knowledge, labhate, attains , param, supreme , madbhaktim, devotion to me, to the supreme lord , (he attains) devotion which is described as knowledge, as the 'fourth' in, '৷৷.four classes of people৷৷.adore me' (7.16). then,",
  "by devotion he knows me in truth, what and who i am , then having known me in truth, he forthwith enters into the supreme",
  "by such devotion, he sees me, who i am and what i am , and thus realising the truth, he enters my kingdom",
  "through devotion he comes to know of me :  who i am and how, in fact, i am-having correctly  known me, he enters me.  then afterwards,",
  "through devotion, he comes to know me fully - who and what i am in reality, who i am and how i am. knowing me thus in truth, he forthwith enters into me",
  "through devotion he knows me in reality, as to what and who i am. then, having known me in truth, he enters (into me) immediately after that (knowledge)",
  "through such devotion, he knows 'who i am,' i.e., knows my own essence and my nature, and 'what i am,' i.e., in my attributes and glory. knowing me truly, he rises to a higher level than this bhakti, and aciring knowledge of the truth, enters into me through devotion. the meaning is that he attains me by means of infinite and unsurpassed bhakti which develops subseent in time to the vision of the nature, attributes and glory of the lord in reality. here the term 'tatah' (through) denotes that devotion is the cause of attainment , for it has been stated to be the cause of entrance n the text, 'but by singel-minded devotion it is possible ৷৷.' (11.54).  in this way, the crowning development has been told starting from the disinterested performance of periodical and occasional rites suitable for the various stations and stages of life, which are to be performed to propitiate the supreme person. sri krsna now explains that even for actions meant for attaining desired objects (kamya-karmas) the crowning stage is the same as for these described above, provided they too are done not for fulfilling one's desires but as offerings to propitiate the supreme person",
  "bhaktya, through devotion, through that devotion described as knowledge , abhijanati, he knows , mam, me , tattvatah, in reality , as to yavan, what i am, with the extensive differences created by limiting adjuncts , and yah asmi, who i am when all distinctions create by the limiting adjuncts are destroyed-me who am the supreme person comparable to space [in points of all-pervasiveness and non-attachment.] and one-without-a-second, absolute, homogeneous consciousness, birthless, ageless, immortal, fearless and deathless. tatah, then , jnatva, having known , mam, me, thus , tattvatah, in truth , visate, he enters into me, myself , tadanantaram, immediately after that (knowledge). here, by saing, 'having known, he enters without delay', it is not meant that the acts of 'knowing' and 'entering immediately after' are different. what then? what is meant is the absolute knowledge itself that has to no other result, [in place of phalantarabhava-jnana-matram eva, ast. reads 'phalantarbhavat jnanamatram eva, absolute knowledge itself, since there is no other result'.-tr.] for it has been said, 'and৷৷.understand me to be the 'knower of the field', (13.2). opponent: has it not been contradictory to say, he knows me through that which is the supreme steadliness (nistha) in knowledge? vedantin: if it be asked, how it is contradictory? opponent: the answer is: whenever any knowledge of something arises in a knower, at that very moment the knower knows that object. hence, he does not depend on steadfastness in knowledge which consists in the repetition of the act of knowing. and therefore, it is contradictory to say one knows not through knowledge, but through steadfastness in knowledge which is a repetition of the act of knowing. vedantin: there is no such fault, since the culmination of knowledge-which (knowledge) is associated with the causes of its unfoldment and maturity, and which has nothing to contradict it- in the conviction that one's own self has been realized is what is referred to by the word nistha (consummation): when knowledge-which concerns the identity of the 'knower of the field' and the supreme self, and which remains associated with the renunciation of all actions that arise from the perception of the distinction among their accessories such as agent etc., and which unfolds from the instruction of the scriptures and teachers, depending on purity of the intellect etc. and humility etc. which are the auxiliary cuases of the origin and maturity of knowledge-continues in the form of the conviction that one's own self has been realized, then that continuance is called the supreme steadfastness (nistha) in knowledge. this steadfastness in knowledge that is such has been spoken of as the highest, the fourth kind of devotion in relation to the three other devotions viz of the afflicted, etc. (cf. 7.16). through that highest devotion one realizes the lord in truth. immediately after that the idea of difference between the lord and the knower of the field vanishes totally. there-fore the statement, 'one knows me through devotion in the form of steadfastness in knowledge', is not contradictory. and, in this sense, all the scriptures-consisting of vedanta (upanisads etc.), history, mythology and smrtis-, as for instance, 'knowing (this very self the brahmanas) renounce৷৷.and lead a mendicant's life' (br. 3.5.1), 'therefore they speak of monasticism as excellent among these austerities' (ma. na. 24.1), 'monasticism verily became supreme' (ibid. 21.2), which enjoin renunciation become meaningful. thus, monasticism means renunciation of rites and duties. there are also the texts, 'having renounced the vedas as well as this world and the next' (ap. dh. su. 2.9.13), and 'give up religion and irreligion' (mbh. sa. 329.40 , 331.44), etc. and here (in the gita) also various relevant) passages have been pointed out. in is not porper that those texts should be meaningless. nor are they merely eulogistic, since they occur in their own contexts. besides, liberation consists in being established in the changeless real nature of the indwelling self. indeed, it is not possible that one who wants to go to the eastern sea and the other who wants to go in the opposite direction to the western sea can have the same course! and steadfastness in knowledg consists in being totally absorbed in maintaining a current of thought with regard to the indwelling self. and that is opposed to coexistence with duties, like going to the western sea. it has been the conclusion of those versed in the valid means of knowledge that the difference between them is as wide as that between a mountain and a mustard seed! therefore it is established that one should have recourse to steadfastness in knowledge only, by relinishing all rites and duties. the fruit of the attainment of success from the yoga of devotion consisting in worshiping the lord with one's own actions is the ability to remain steadfast in knowledge, from which, follows stead-fastness in knowledge, culminating in the result, liberation. that yoga of devotion to the lord is now being praised in this concluding section dealing with the purport of the scripture, with a veiw to generating a firm conviction with regard to it (the purport of the scripture):",

'pada' means that which is attained. the meaning is that he attains me. [the idea is that the performance of even those ritualistic actions enjoined for those having the fulfilment of certain desires in view, even these actions, if done without any such desire but only as the worship of the supreme person - the have the same effect as the performance of the enjoined daily and occasional rituals to which no effect except the purification of the self is offered by the sastras.]  since it is so, therefore:",

(reply:) this is wrong since it has been established by the text, 'sacrifice, charity and austerity are verily the purifiers,' that even the nityakarmas have results. for a seeker of liberation who wants to give up even the nityakarmas from fear of their being causes of bondage, how can there be any association with actions done for desired results? moreover, the phrase etani api cannot apply to actions done for desired results (kamyakarmas), since they have been denigrated in, '৷৷.indeed, actions is ite inferior' (2.49), and in, '৷৷.by actions other than that action meant for god' (3.9), and since, on the strength of the texts [which support the two earlier arguments.], 'the vedas have the three alities as their object' (2.45), 'those who are versed in the vedas, who are drinkers of soma,৷৷.(pray for the heavenly goal by worshipping) me' (9.20), and 'they enter into the human world on the exhaustion of their merit' (9.21), it has been definitely stated that actions done for desired results are causes of bondage , and also because they are far removed from the context",

  "'relinishing all dharmas means the complete relinishment of the sense of agency, possessiveness, fruits etc., in the practising of karma, jnana and bhakti yogas in the way instructed, and the realising of me as the agent, object of worship, the means and the end. it means that relinishment is not of all devotional duties but only of the sense of agency and the fruits. this is the sastraic relinishment of all dharmas. it is firmly established in the beginning of this chapter commencing from, 'listen regarding my decision, o arjuna, about abandonment , for abandonment is declared to be of three kinds' (18.4), and 'renouncing attachments and also the fruit, such abandonment is regarded as sattvika ৷৷. for it is impossible for one who bears the body to abandon acts entirely. but he who gives up the fruits of works, is called the abandoner' (18.9-11).  if you practise such abandonment of the sense of agency and fruits, i will release you from all 'sins' - i.e., i will release you from all evil incompatible with the attainment of myself, consisting of innumerable acts of the nature of doing what ought not to be done and not doing what ought to be done. these piled up from beginningless times from the obstruction in the way. grieve not, you should not despair , for i shall release you from all these obstructions.  another (alternative) explanation is this:  bhakti yoga is possible only for those people to whom the lord is exceedingly dear and who are free from all evils. those evils are so huge in their case that the expiatory rites which could wash them off, could not be performed in the limited time of one's life span. ajuna therefore thought that he was unfit for commencing bhakti yoga. to remove the grief of arjuna the lord said:  'completely relinishing all dharmas, seek me alone for refuge.' expiatory rites can be taken here as what is meant by dharma, completely forsake these rites (dharmas) appropriate for the removal of numerous and varied sins piled up from beginningless time and obstructing the starting of bhakti yoga. the expiatory rites consist of practices like krcchra, candrayana, kusmanda, vaisvanara, vratapati, pavitresti, trvrit, agnistoma etc., which are of manifold varieties, and which are difficult to perform on account of the brevity of life. so in order to succeed in commencing bhakti yoga, seek me alone for refuge. i am supremely compassionate, the refuge of all without considering the differences of character among them, and am an ocean of tenderness for those dependent on me. i will release you from all evil, the nature of which has been explained as incompatible with the commencement of bhakti yoga. grieve not. [both these interpretations of this famous verse are said to teach only bhakti yoga and not prapatti. but the estion will rise in one's mind - why should it not be so taken?]",
  "sarvadharman etc.  abandoning all attributes :  this act of slaying the kinsmen and the like that arises incidentally while fighting a war - not owning those acts as your own attribute by your thought  'i am the doer of all these' ,  also giving up by mind, the notion  'if the act of slaying the teacher etc., is avoided, merit will accrue to me'.  come to me:  come to me alone, the agent-of-all-actions, the supreme lord, the sovereign.  as your refuge :  as the guardian of all your natural impulses.  on that account i, the omniscient, shall rescue you from all the sins.  don't be sorrowful :  don't get perplexed 'what to be done'",
  "sarva-dharman, all forms of rites and duties: here the word dharma (righteousness) includes adharma (unrighteousness) as well , for, what is intended is total renunciation of all actions, as is enjoined in vedic and smrti texts like, 'one who has not desisted from bad actions' (ka. 1.2.24), 'give up religions and irreligion' (mbh. sa. 329.40), etc. parityajya, abandoning all rites and duties , [being a ksatriya, arjuna is not alified for steadfastness in knowledge through monasticism in the primary sense. still, the gita being meant for mankind as a whole, monasticism is spoken of here by accepting arjuna as a representative man.] saranam vraja, take refuge , mam ekam, in me alone, the self of all, the same in all, existing in all beings, the lord, the imperishable, free from being in the womb, birth, old age and death-by knowing that i am verily so. that is, know it for certain that there is nothing besides me. by revealing my real nature, aham, i , moksayisyami, shall free , tva, you, who have this certitude of understanding , sarva-paphyah, from all sins, from all bondages in the form of righteousness and unrighteousness. it has also been stated, 'i, residing in their hearts, destroy the dark-ness born of ignorance with the luminous lamp of knowledge' (10.11). therefore, ma, do not , sucah, grieve, i.e. do not sorrow. in this scripture, the gita, has knowledge been established as the supreme means to liberation, or is it action, or both? why does the doubt arise? (because) the passages like, '৷৷.by realizing which one attains immortality' (13.12), 'then, having known me in truth, he enters (into me) immediately after that (knowledge)' (55), etc. point to the attainment of liberation through knowledge alone. texts like, 'your right is for action alone' (2.47), '(you undertake) action itself (4.15), etc. show that actions have to be under-taken as a matter of compulsory duty. since both knowledge and action are thus enjoined as duties, therefore the doubt may arise that they, in combination as well, may become the cause of liberation. objection: what, again, would be the result of this iniry? vedantin: well, the resut will verily be this: the ascertainment of one of these as the cuase of the highest good. hence this has to be investigated more extensively. knowledge of the self, however, is exclusively the cause of the highest good , for, through the removal of the idea of differences, it culminates in the result that is liberation. the idea of distinction among action, agent and result is ever active with regard to the self because of ignorance. this ignorance in the form, 'my work , i am the agent , i shall do this work for that resut', has been at work from time without beginning. the dispeller of this ignorance is this knowledge regarding the self-in the form, 'i am the absolute, non agent, free from action and result , there is none else other than myself because, when it (knowledge) arises it despels the idea of differences which is the cause of engagement in action. the word 'however' above is used for ruling out the other two alternatives. this refutes the two other alternative views by showing that the highest good cannot be attained through mere actions, nor by a combination of knowledge and action. besides, since liberation is not a product, therefore it is illogical that it should have action as its means. indeed, an eternal entity cannot be produced by either action of knowledge. objection: in that case, ever exclusive knowledge is purposeless. vedantin: no, since knowledge, being the destroyer of ignorance, culminates in liberation which is directly experienced result. the fact that knowledge, which removes the darkness of ignorance, culminates in liberation as its result is directly perceived in the same way as is the result of the light of a lamp which removes ignorance the form of sanke etc. and darkness from objects such as rope etc. indeed, the result of light amounts to the mere (awareness of the) rope, free from the wrong notions of snake etc. so is the case with knowledge. as in the case of the acts like 'cutting down', 'producing fire by friction' etc., in which accessories such as the agent and others operate, and which have perceivable results, there is no possiblity of (the agent etc.) engaging in any other activity giving some other result apart from 'splitting into two', 'seeing (or lighting of) fire' etc, similarly, in the case of the agent and the other factors engaged in the 'act' of steadfastness in knowledge which has a tangible result, there is no possibility of (their) engagement in any other action which has a result different from that in the form of the sole existence of the self. hence, steadfastness in knowledge combined with action is not logical. objection: may it not be argued that this is possible like the acts of eating and agnihotra sacrifice etc.? [as such a common action as eating can go hand in hand with such vedic rites as the agnihotra-sacrifice, so, actions can be combined with knowledge.] vedantin: no, since it is unreasonable that, when knowledge which resutls in liberation is attained, there can remain a hankering for results of actions. just as there is no desire for an action or its result [action, i.e. digging etc. , result, i.e. bathing etc.] in connection with a well, pond, etc. when there is a flood all around, similarly when knowledge which has liberation for its result is attained there can be no possibility of hankering for any other result or any action which leads to it. indeed, when somody is engaged in actions aimed at winning a kingdom, there can be no possibility of his engaging in any activity for securing a piece of land, or having a longing for it! hence, action does not constitute the means to the highest good. nor do knowledge and action in combination. further, knowledge which has liberation as its result can have no dependence on the assistance of action, because, being the remover of ignorance, it is opposed (to action). verily, darkness cannot be the dispeller of darkness. therefore knowledge alone is the means to the highest good. objection: not so, because from non-performance of nityakarmas one incurs sin. besides, freedom (of the self) is eternal. as for the view that liberation is attainable through knowledge alone, it is wrong. for, if nityakarmas [as also the occasional duties (naimittika-karmas).] which are prescribed by the vedas are not performed, then one will incur evil in the form of going to hell etc. counter-objection: if this be so, then, since liberation cannot come from action, will there not arise the contingency of there being no liberation at all? pseudo-vedantin: not so, for liberation is eternal. as a result of performing nityakarmas there will not be incurring of evil, and as a result of not doing any prohibited action (nisiddha-karma) there will not be any possibility of birth in an undesirable body , from relinishing actions meant for desired results (kamya-karmas) there will be no possibility of being born in some desirable body. since there is no cause to produce another body when the present body falls after the results of actions that produced this body get exhausted by experiencing them, and since one does not have attachment etc., therefore liberation consists in the mere continuance of the self in its own natural state. thus, liberation is attained without effort. objection: may it not be argued that, since in the case of actions done in many past lives-which are calculated to yield such results as attainment of heaven, hell, etc. but have not commenced bearing results-there is no possiblity of their being experienced, therefore they cannot be exhausted? pseudo-vedantin: no, since the suffering of pain from the effort involved in the nityakarmas can reasonably be (considered to be) the experiencing of their [i.e. of actions done in past lives, which have not commenced bearing their fruits.-tr.] results. or, since the nityakarmas, like expiations, may be considered as being meant for eliminating the sins incurred earlier, and since actions that have begun bearing their fruits get exhausted merely through their being experienced, therefore liberation is attained without effort-provided no fresh actions are performed. vedantin: no, since there is the upanisadic text, 'knowing him alone, one goes beyond death , there is no other way to go by' (sv. 3.8), which states that for liberation there is no other path but enlightenment , also because there is the upanisadic statement that liberation for an unenlightened person is as impossible as the rolling up of the sky like leather (sv. 6.20) , and since it is mentioned in the puranas and the smrtis that liberation follows only from knowledge. (from your view) it also follows that there is no possibility of the exhaustion of the results of virtuous deeds which have not as yet begun yielding their fruits. and, as there is the possibility of the persistence of sins which were incurred in the past but have not yet commenced yielding results, similarly there can be the possibility of the persistence of virtues which have not yet begun bearing fruits. and so, if there be no scope of their being exhausted without creating another body, then there is no possibility of liberation. and since attachment, hatred and delusion, which are the causes of virtue and vice, cannot be eradicated through any means other than knowledge, therefore the eradication of virtue and vice becomes impossible. besides, since the sruti [see ch. .2.23.1 and br. 1.5.16-tr.] mentions that nityakarmas have heaven as their result, and there is the smrti text, 'persons belonging to castes and stages of life, and engaged in their own duties' ['৷৷.attain to a high, immeasurable happiness.'-tr.] (ap. dh. su. 2.2.2.3), etc., therefore the exhaustion of (the fruits of) actions (through nityakarmas) is not possible. as for those who say, 'the nityakarmas, being painful in themselves, must surely be the result of evil deeds done in the past , but apart from being what they are, they have no other result because this is not mentioned in the vedas and they are enjoined on the basis of the mere fact that one is alive'-(this is) not so, because actions which have not become operative cannot yield any result. besides, there is no ground for experiencing a particular conseence in the form of pain [pain involved in the performance of nityakarmas.] the statement, that the pain one suffers from the effort involved in performing the nityakarmas is the result of sinful acts done in past lives, is false. indeed, it does not stand to reason that the result of any action which did not become operative at the time of death to yield its fruit is experienced in a life produced by some other actions. otherwise, there will be no reason why the fruit of some action that is to lead to hell should not be experienced in a life that is produced by such actions as agnihotra etc. and is meant for enjoying the result in the form of heaven! besides, that (pain arising from the effort in performing nityakarmas) cannot be the same as the conseence in the form of the particular suffering arising from sin. since there can be numerous kinds of sins with results productive of various kinds of sorrows, therefore, if it be imagined that their (sins') result will be merely in the form of pain arising from the effort in undertaking the nityakarmas, then it will certainly not be possible to suppose that they (the sins incurred in the past) are the causes of such obstacles as the pairs of opposites (heat and cold, etc.), disease etc., and that the result of sins incurred in the past will be only the pain arising from the exertion in performing nityakarmas, but not the sufferings like carrying stones on the head etc. further, it is out of context to say this, that the pain resulting from the effort in performing nityakarmas is the result of sinful acts done in the past. objection: how? vedantin: what is under discussion is that the sin committed in the past, which has not begun to bear fruit, cannot be dissipated. in that context you say that pain resulting from the effort in undertaking nityakarmas is the result of action which has begun bearing fruit, not of that which has not yet commenced yielding fruit! on the other hand, if you think that all sins committed in the past have begun yielding their results, then it is unreasonable to specify that the pain resulting from the exertion in performing the nitya-karmas is their only result. and there arises the contingency of the injunction to perform nityakarmas becoming void, because the sinful deed which has begun bearing fruit can ligically be dissipated only be experiencing its result. further, if pain be the result of nityakarmas enjoined by the vedas, then it is seen to arise from the very effort in undertaking nityakarmas-as in the case of excercise etc. to imagine that it is the result of something else is illogical. [the pain arising from bodily excercise is the result of the excercise itself, and not the result of any past sin! similarly, the pain resulting from undertaking nityakarmas is the conseence of that performance itself, and need not be imagined to be the result of any past sin.] and if the nityakarmas have been enjoined simply on the basis of a person's being alive, it is unreasonable that it should be the result of sins committed in the past, any more than expiation is. an expiation that has been enjoined following a particular sinful act is not the result of that sin! on the other hand, if the suffering arising from expiation be the reslut of that very sin which is its cause, then the pain from the effort in performing nityakarmas, though prescribed merely on the fact of one's being alive, may become the fruit of that very fact of one's being alive-which was itself the occasion (for enjoining the nityakarmas)-, because both the nityakarmas and expiatory duties are indistinguishable so far as their being occasioned by something is concerned. moreover, there is the other fact: there can be no such distinction that only the pain resulting from the performance of nityakarmas is the result of past sinful deeds, but not so the pain from performing kamya-karmas (rites and duties undertaken for desired results), because the pain in performing agnihotra-sacrifice etc. is the same when it is performed as a nityakarma or as a kamya-karma. thus the latter also may be the result of past sinful acts. this being the case, it is untenable to assume on the ground of circumstantial inference that, since no result is enjoined in the vedas for nityakarmas and since its prescription cannot be justified on any other ground, therefore pain from the effort in performing nityakarmas is the result of sinful past deeds. thus, the (vedic) injunction being unjustifiable otherwise, it can be inferred that nityakarmas have got some result other than the pain arising from the effort in undertaking them. it also involves this contradiction: it is contradictory to say that through the performance of nityakarma a result of some other action is experienced. and when this is admitted, it is again a contradiction to say that that very experience is the result of the nityakarma, and yet that niyakarma has no result! moreover, when agnihotra and other sacrifices are performed for desirable results (kamya-agnihotra), then the agnihotra etc. which are performed as nityakarma (nitya-agnihotra) become accomplished simultaneously (on a account of its being a part ofthe former). hence, since the kamya-agnihotra (as an act) is dependent on and not different from the nitya-agnihotra, therefore the result of the agnihotra and other sacrifices performed with a desire for results will get exhausted through the suffering involved in the exertion in undertaking it (the nitya-agnihotra). on the other hand, if the result of kamya-agnihotra etc. be different, viz heaven etc., then even the suffering arising from the exertion in performing them ought to be necessarily different (from the suffering involved in the nitya-agnihotra). and that is not the fact, because it contradicts what is directly perceived , for the pain resulting from the effort in performing only the nitya-(-agnihotra) does not differ from the pain resulting from the exertion in undertaking the kamya (-agnihotra). besides, there is this other consideration: actions which have not been enjoined or prohibited (by the scriptures) produce immediate results. but those enjoined or prohibited by the scriptures do not produce immediate results , were they to do so, then there would be no effort even with regard to heaven etc. and injunctions concerning unseen results. and it cannot be imagined that only the fruit of (nitya-) agnihotra etc. gets exhausted through the suffering arising from the effort in performing them, but the kamya (-agnihotra) has exalted results like heaven etc. merely as a conseence of the fact of desire for results, though as acts there is no essential difference between them (the nitya and the kamya) and there is no additional subsidiary part, processes of performance, etc. (in the kamya-agnihotra). therefore, it can never be established that nitya-karmas have no unseen results. and hence, enlightenment alone, not the performance of nityakarmas, is the cuase of the total dissipation of actions done through ignorance, be they good or bad. for, all actions have for their origin ignorance and desire. thus has it been established (in the following passages) that action (rites and duties) is meant for the ignorant, and steadfastness in knowledge-after renunciation of all actions-is meant for the enlightened: 'both of them do not know' (2.19) , 'he who knows this one as indestructible, eternal' (2.21) , 'through the yoga of knowledge for the men of realization , through the yoga of action for the yogis' (3.3) , 'the ignorant, who are attached to work' (3.26) , 'but৷৷.the one who is a knower৷৷.does not become attached, thinking thus: 'the organs rest on the objects of the organs'' (3.28) , 'the embodied man৷৷.having given up all actions mentally, continues' (5.13) , 'remaining absorbed in the self, the knower of reality should think, 'i certainly do not do anything'' (5.8) , i.e , the unenlightened person thinks, 'i do' , 'for (the sage) who wishes to ascend (to dhyana-yoga), action is said to be the means৷৷.when he has ascended (when he is established in the yoga of meditation), inaction alone is said to be the means' (6.3) , 'noble indeed' are all the three (classes of) unenlightened persons, 'but the man of knowledge is the very self. (this is) my opinion' (7.18) , the unenlightened who perform their rites and duties, 'who are desirous of pleasures, attain the state of going and returning' (9.21) , 'becoming non-different from me and meditative' (9.22) and endowed with steadfast devotion, they worship (me) the self which has been described as comparable to space and taintless , and 'i grant that possession of wisdom by which they reach me' (10.10) , i.e., the unenlightened persons who perform rites and duties 'do not reach me.' those who perform works for the lord and who, though they be the most devout, are ignorant persons performing rites and duties,-they remain involved in practices which, in a descending order, culminate in giving up the fruit of actions (cf. 12.6-11). but those who meditate on the indefinable immutable take recourse to the disciplines stated in the passages beginning with 'he who is not hateful towards any creature' (12.13) and ending with that chapter, and also resort to the path of knowledge presented in the three chapters beginning with the chapter on the 'field'. the three results of actions, viz the undesirable etc. (cf. 12), do not accrue only to the mendicants belonging to the order of paramahamsas (the highest order of monks)-who have renounced all actions that originate from the five causes beginning with the locus (cf. 14), who possess the knowledge of the oneness and non-agentship of the self (17,20), who continue in the supreme steadfastness in knowledge, who know the real nature of the lord, and who have taken refuge in the unity of the real nature of the lord with the self. it does accrue to the others who are not monks, the ignorant persons who perform rites and duties. such is this distinction made in the scripture gita with regard to what is duty and what is not. objection: may it not be argued that it cannot be proved that all actions are due to ignorance? reply: no, (it can be proved,) as in the case of slaying a brahmin. although the nityakarmas are known from the scriptures, still they are meant only for the ignorant. as such an action as killing a brahmin, even though known to be a source of evil from the scripture prohibiting it, is still perpetrated by one who has defects such as ignorance, passion, etc.-because impulsion to any action is otherwise not possible-, so also is it with regard to the nitya, naimittika and kamya actions. objection: may it not be held that impulsion to nityakarma etc. is not possible if the self be not known as a distinct entity? [unless one knows the self to be distinct from the body etc. he will not perform the nityakarmas etc. meant for results in the other worlds, viz heaven etc. (tr.:) in place of vyatiriktatmani, ast. reads 'deha-vyatiriktatmani, the self which is distinct from the body'.] reply: no, since it is seen that with regard to actions which are of the nature of motion and are accomplished by the not-self, one engages in them with the idea, 'i do.' [the actionless self is not the agent of the movements of the body etc. still agentship is superimposed on it through ignorance.] objection: can it not be said that the notion of egoism with regard to the aggregate of body etc. occurs in a figurative sense , it is not false? reply: no, since its effects [i.e. the effects of the notion of egoism.] also will become figurative. objection: the notion of 'i' with regard to the aggregate of one's own body etc. occurs in a figurative sense. as with regard to one's own son it is said (in the veda), 'it is you yourself who is called the son' (sa. br. 14.9.4.26), and in common parlance also it is said, 'this cow is my very life', so is the case here. [as the use of the word 'i' with regard to a son is figurative, so also with regard to the body.] this is certainly not a false notion. however, a false notion (of identity) occurs in the case of a stump and a man, when the distinction between them is not evident (due to darkness). reply: a figuratively expressed notion cannot lead to an effect in the real sense, because that (notion) is used for the eulogy of its basis with the help of a word of comparison which remains understood. as for instance, such sentences as, 'devadatta is a lion', 'the boy is a fire'-implying 'like a lion', 'like a fire', on the basis of the similarity of cruelty, the tawny colour, etc.-are meant only for eulogizing devadatta and the boy who are the basis (i.e. the subjects of the two sentences). but no action of a lion or a fire is accomplished because of the use of the figurative words or ideas. on the contrary, one experiences the evil effects of false notions. [therefore the idea of 'i' with regard to one's body etc. does not occur in a secondary sense, but it does so falsely.] and with regard to the subjects of the figurative notions, one understands, 'this devadatta cannot be a lion , this boy cannot be a fire.' similarly, actions done by the aggregate of body etc., which is the 'self' in a figurative sense, cannot be held to have been done by the self which is the real subject of the notion of 'i'. for, actions done by the figurative lion or fire cannot be considered to have been accomplished by the real lion or fire. nor is any action of the real lion and fire accomplished through the (figurative) cruelty or tawnyaness , for, their purpose is fully served by being used for eulogy. and those who are praised know, 'i am not a lion , i am not fire , and neither is the work of a lion or fire mine.' so the more ligical notion is, 'the action of the aggregate (of body etc.) do not belong to me who am the real self', and not, 'i am the agent , it is my work.' as for the assertion made by some that the self acts through its own memory, deisre and effort, which are the causes of activity-that is not so, for they are based on false knowledge. memory, desire, effort, etc. indeed follow from the tendencies born from the experience of the desirable and the undesirable results of actions (-which actions themselves arise from the notions of the 'desirable' and the 'undesirable') caused by false knowledge. [false knowledge gives rise to the ideas of the desirable and the undesirable. from these arise desire and repulsion. actions which follow give rise to the experience of their desirable and undesirable results. such experiences create impressions in the mind, from which are born memory etc.] just as in this life virtue, vice and the experience of their results are cuased by the identification (of the self) with the aggregate of body etc. and attraction, repulsion, etc., so also was it in the previous birth, and even in the life preceding that. thus it can be inferred that past and future mundane existence is without beginning and is a product of ignorance. and from this it becomes proved that the absolute cessation of mundane existence is caused by steadfastness in knowledge, accompanied by renunciation of all rites and duties. besides, since self-identification with the body is nothing but ignorance, therefore, when the (ignorance) ceases, there remains so possibility of re-birth, and so, mundane existence becomes impossible. the identification of the self with the aggregate of body etc. is nothing but ignorance, because in common life it is not seen that anybody who knows, 'i am different from cattle etc., and the cattle etc. are different from me', entertains the notion of 'i' with regard to them. however, mistaken perceiving a stump to be a man, one may out of indiscrimination entertain the idea of 'i' with regard to the aggregate of body etc. , not so when perceiving them as distinct. as for that notion of considering the son to be oneself-as mentioned in, 'it is you yourself who is called the son' (sa. br. 14.9.4.26)-, that is a metaphor based on the relationship between the begotten and the begetter. and no real action like eating etc.can be accomplished through something considered metaphorically as the self, just as actions of the real lion or fire (cannot be accomplished) by someone metaphorically thought of to be a lion or fire. objection: since an injunction relating to an unseen result is valid, therefore, may it not be said that the purposes of the self are accomplished by the body and organs which are figuratively considered to be the self? reply: no, since the thinking of them as the self is the result of ignorance. the body, organs, etc. are not the self in a figurative sense. objection: how then? reply: although the self is devoid of relationship, still, by an ascription of relationship (to the self), they (body etc.) come to be regarded as the self, verily through a false notion. for, this identification (of body etc.) with the self exists so long as the false notion is there, and ceases to exist when it is not there. so long as ignorance lasts, identification of the self with the aggregate of body and organs is seen only in the case of non-discriminating, immature, ignorant poeple who say, 'i am tall', 'i am fair'. but in the case of discriminating persons who possess the knowledge, 'i am different from the aggregate of body etc.', there does not arise the idea of egoism with regard to the body etc. at that time (i.e. simultaneously with that knowledge). hence, since it (i.e. identification of the self with the body etc.) ceases in the absence of the false notion, therefore it is a creation of that (false notion), and not a figurative notion. it is only when the common and the uncommon features of the lion and devadatta, or of fire and the boy, are known distinctly, that a figurative notion or verbal expression can occur , not when the common and the uncommon features are unknown. as for the argument that (the figurative notion should be accepted) on the authority of the vedas, we say, 'no', because their validity concerns unseen results. the validity of the vedas holds good only with regard to matters concerning the relation between ends and means of agnihotra etc., which are not known through such valid means of knowledge as direct perception , but not with regard to objects of direct perception etc., because the validity of the vedas lies in revealing what is beyond direct perception. therefore it is not possible to imagine that the idea of egism with regard to the aggregate of body etc., arising from an obviously of false knowledge, is a figurative notion. surely, even a hundred vedic texts cannot become valid if they assert that fire is cold or non-luminous! should a vedic text say that fire is cold or non-luminous, even then one has to assume that the intended meaning of the text is different, for otherwise (its) validity cannot be maintained , but one should not assume its meaning in a way that might contradict some other valid means of knowledge or contradict its own statement. objection: may it not be said that since actions are undertaken by one possessed of a false idea of agentship, therefore, when the agent ceases to be so ['according to you (the vedantin), an ignorant man alone can be an agent. therefore, when he becomes illumined, he will cease to be ignorant and conseently the vedas will cease to be valid for him.'] the vedas will become invalid? reply: no, since the vedas become logically meaningful in respect of knowledge of brahman. [though the vedic injunctions about rituals etc. be inapplicable in the case of an enlightened person, still they have empirical validity before enlightenment. besides, the vedas have real validity with regard to the knowledge of brahman.] objection: may it not be said that there arises the contingency of the vedic texts enjoining knowledge of brahman becoming as invalid as those texts enjoining rites and duties? reply: no, since there cannot possibly be any notion which can remove (the knowledge of brahman). unlike the manner in which the idea of egoism with regard to the aggregate of body etc. is removed after the realization of the self from hearing the vedic injunctions regarding the knowledge of brahman, the realization of the self in the self can never be removed in any way in that manner by anything whatsoever-just as the knowledge that fire is hot and luminous is irremovable-, since (self-) realization is inseparable from its result (i.e. cessation of ignorance). besides, the vedic texts enjoining rites (and duties) etc. are not invalid, because they, through the generation of successively newer tendencies by eliminating the successively preceding tendencies, are meant for creating the tendency to turn towards the indwelling self. [the vedic injunctions make people up rituals etc. by giving up their earlier worldly tendencies. thery their minds become purified. the purified mind then aspires to know the indwelling self. thus, since the ritualistic injunctions are meant for making a person turn towards the knowledge ofthe indwelling self, they are not invalid.] although the means be unreal (in itself), still it may be meaningful in relation to the truth of the purpose it serves, as are the eulogistic sentences (arthavada) [see note on p. 40.-tr.] occuring along with injunctions. even in the world, when it becomes necessary to make to child or a lunatic drink milk etc. it is said that it will help growth of hair [cuda, lit. hair on the top of the head , or single lock of hair left on the crown of the head after tonsure. see v.s.a.] etc.! before the dawn of knowledge, the (ritualistic) vedic texts concerned with a different situation [the situation obtaining before the dawn of self-knowledge.] are also as valid in themselves as are direct perception etc. occuring due to self-identification with the body etc. on the other hand, as for your view 'the self, though inactive by itself, acts through its mere proximity , and that itself constitutes agentship of the self in the primary sense. just as it is well known that a king, though not himself engaged in a battle, is, merely by virtue of his being in charge, said to be fighting when his soldiers are fighting, and that he is victorious or defeated , similarly, as the ?nder of an army acts through his mere orders, and it is seen that the results of the actions accrue to the king or to the ?nder , or, just as the actions of the priests are ascribed to the sacrificer,-in that very manner are the actions done by the body etc. ought to be of the self because the result of those actions accrues to the self. and, as the agentship of a magnet which, in fact, is not active, is attributed to it in the primary sense because it causes a piece of iron to move, similar is the agentship of the self'-that is wrong, since it will amunt to an inactive entity becoming an agent. objection: may not agentship be of various kinds?  reply: no, for in the case of the 'king' and others it is seen that they have agentship even in the primary sense. as for the king, he fights even through his personal engagement. and he has agentship in the primary sense by virtue of making (his) warriors fight, distributing wealth, and also reaping the fruits of victory or defeat. similarly, the agentship of a sacrificer is primary by virtue of his offering the main oblation and giving gifts due to the priests. therefore it is understood that the agentship which is attributed to an inactive entity is figurative. if primary agentship consisting in their personal engagement is not perceived in the case of the king, a sacrificer and others, then it could be assumed that they have primary agentship owing to the mere fact of their presence, just as a magnet has by virtue of making the iron move. but in the case of the king and others it is not perceived that they have no personal engagement in that way. therefore, even the agentship owing to mere presence is a figurative one. and if that be so, the connection with the result of such agentship will also be figurative. no action in the primary sense is performed by an agent figuratively thought to be so. hence the assertion is certainly wrong that owing to the activities of the body etc. the actionless self becomes an agent and experiencer. but everything becomes possible due to error. this is just as it happens in dream or in jugglery! besides, in deep sleep, absorption in brahman, etc. where the current of the mistaken idea of self-identity with the body etc. ceases, evils like agentship, enjoyership, etc. are not perceived. therefore this delusion of mundane existence is surely due to false knowledge , but it is not reality. conseently, it is established that it ceases absolutely as a result of full enlightenment. having summed up in this chapter the import of the whole of the scripture gita, and having again summarized it specially here at the end (in verse 66) for the sake of emphasizing the purport of the scripture, now after that, the lord states the rules for handing down the scripture:",
  "this is never to be spoken by thee to one who is devoid of austerities or devotion, nor to one who does not render service or who does not desire to listen, nor to one who cavils at me",
  "speak not this to one who has not practised austerities, or to him who does not love, or who will not listen, or who mocks",
  "this  [knowledge] is for you,  and it should never be imparted to one who does not observe austerities , to him who has no  devotion , to him who has no desire to listen , and to him who is indignant towards me",
  "never should this be told by you to one who is not austere, who is not a devotee, nor to one who has no wish to listen, nor certainly to him who traduces me",
  "this (that i have taught) you should not ever be taught to one who is devoid of austerities and to one who is not a devotee , also, neither to one who does not render service, nor as well to one who cavils at me",
  "i have taught you this most secret doctrine. this should not be imparted by you to someone who has not practised austere disciplines. never should this be taught to someone who is not devoted to me and to you, the teacher (i.e., when you have to play the role of a teacher of this doctrine). the meaning is that it should not be taught by you to someone who, though practising austerities, is not a devotee and does not serve me. it is also never to be taught to one who has no wish to listen, even though he is a devotee. nor should it be imparted to one who traduces me, that is, who - when my nature, glories and attributes are described - discovers defects in them. the differences of case (from ablative to nominative form) is to teach that the last one is the most despicable character",
  "idam etc.  if the secrecy of this knowledge is maintained it would yield success, because it is out of reach of all [ordinary]  persons.  when the knot of sin is cut off through observing  austerities, then only the results of good act is ready to become ripe.  hence, austerity comes first.  due to austerity, faith is born.  the same (faith) is devotion here.  the faith, even if it is born, does not grow well, in case it becomes visible only for a moment  and then perishes like lightning.  therefore to help its growth, the desire to listen to is [next].  in the case of certain person, even all this arises with regard to the useless knowledge of the dry sankhya (reasoning) system that admits no supreme lord.  even with regard to a system  that adimts the supreme lord, it may, n the case of  another person-on account of his craving for fruit of action-emerge by raising the fruit-of-action alone to the status of importance and by humbling down one's own worshipful self to the role of an instrument in achieving that fruit it has been declared :   'the agent also [is an auxiliary], because he is for the action [enjoined].'\t\t\t\t\t(js, iii, i, 6) , and   'actions also [are auxiliary] because they are for the purpose of fruits.'\t\t\t\t\t\t(js, iii, i, 4).   thus in both the instances there is indignation, meaning  'disregard' with the bhagavat (self) - this is the purport",
  "idam, this scripture , which has been taught by me te, to you, for your good, for terminating mundane existence , an vacyam, should not be taught (-na is connected with the remote word vacyam-) , atapaskaya, to one who is devoid of austerities. it should kadacana, never, under any condition whatsoever , be taught abhaktaya, to one who is not a devotee, who is devoid of devotion to his teacher and god, even if he be a man of austerity. neither should it be taught even asurusave, to one who does not redner service-even though he may be a devotee and a man of austerity. na ca, nor as well , to him yah, who , abhyasuyati, cavils , mam, at me, at vasudeva-thinking that i am an ordinary person , to him who, not knowing my godhood, imputes self-adulation etc. to me and cannot tolerate me. he too is unfit , to him also it should not be imparted. from the force of the context it is understood that the scripture should be taught to one who has devotion to the lord, is austere, renders service, and does not cavil. as to that, since it is seen (in a smrti)-'to one who is intelligent or to one who is austere'-that there is an option between the two, it follows that this should be imparted either to an austere person given to service and devotion, or to an intelligent person endowed with them. it should not be imparted to an austere or even an intelligent person if he lacks service and devotion. it should not be taught to one who cavils at the lord, even though he be possessed of all the good alities. and it should be taught to one whoserves his teacher and is devout. this is the rule for transmitting the scripture. now the lord states the fruit derived by one who transmits the scripture:",

  "verily the renunciation of obligatory action is not proper , the abandonment of the same from delusion is declared to be tamasic",
  "it is not right to give up actions which are obligatory , and if they are misunderstood, it is the result of sheer ignorance",
  "the renunciation of the enjoined action does not stand to reason , and completely relinishing it, out of ignorance is proclaimed, on all sides, as an act of the tamas (strand)",
  "but the renunciation of obligatory acts is not proper. abandonment of these through delusion is declared to be tamasika",
  "the abandoning of daily obligatory acts (nityakamas) is not justifiable. giving up that through delusion is declared to be based on tamas",
  "obligatory acts consist of daily, and occasional ceremonies like the five great sacrifices , their abandonment is not proper, for without actions even the sustenance of the body would be impossible, as already stated:  'from no-work, not even the body can be sustained' (3.8). the sustenance of the body by eating the sacrificial remnants produces perfect knowledge. otherwise, as declared in the statement, 'but the sinful ones eat sin' (3.13). the satisfaction that comes by eating food which is not the remnant of sacrifice and which is therefore of the form of sin, is productive of erroneous knowledge in the mind. for, as declared in the sruti, 'the mind consists of food' (cha. u., 6.5.4), the mind is sustained by food. also, there is the sruti text, 'when the food is pure, the mind becomes pure , when the mind is pure, remembrance becomes firmly fixed , and when remembrance is acired, there is release from all knots of the heart' (ibid., 7.26.2). it is therefore proved by the sruti that knowledge of the form of direct perception of brahman, is dependent on the purity of food. hence the great sacrifices and such other obligatory and occasional rites are worthy of adoption till one's death, as they help in the knowledge of the brahman. the renunciation of these is therefore not proper. thus, the relinishment of these acts which produce knowledge through the delusion that they bind the self, is rooted in tamas.  tamasika renunciation has its roots in tamas. since such renunciation has its roots in ignorance which is the effect of tamas, such renunciation is said to have its roots in tamas. for tamas is the root of ignorance as has been stated:  'from tamas arise negligence and delusion, and also, ignorance' (14.17). ignorance is erroneous knowledge which is antagonistic to right knowledge. so, it will be taught, 'that reason which, enveloped in tamas, regards wrong as right, and which reverses every value, o arjuna, is tamasika' (18.32). it is for this reason that the renunciation of obligatory and occasional actions are said to have their roots in erroneous knowledge",
  "therefore, sannyasah, the abandoning , niyatasya tu karmanah, of the daily obligatory acts, by the seeker of liberation who is as yet unenlightened and is fit for rites and duites , na apapadyate, is not justifiable, because what is desired is the purification of unenlightened persons. parityagah, giving up , tasya, of that, of the daily obligatory duty , mohat, through delusion, through ignorance , parikirtitah, is declared , to be tamasah, based on tamas. niyata is that duty which must be performed. that an act is niyata (obligatory) and it is relinished is contradictory. therefore the giving up of that through delusion is declared to be based on tamas, for delusion is tamas. besides,",

  "arjuna said  'delusion' or misapprehension is perverted knowledge. by your grace it has been destroyed. 'smrti' or memory is the knowledge of things as they really are. i have acired that. misapprehension here is the misconception that the self is the prakrti (body-mind) which is the non-self in reality. it consists in one not apprehending that all intelligent and non-intelligent entities, by reason of their forming the body of the supreme being, have him as their atman and are thus ensouled by him. the misapprehension also consists in the lack of knowledge that actions, obligatory and occasional, do not cause bondage but actually form a means for the propitiation of the supreme being. all such misapprehensions are now destroyed.  the various phases of knowledge that cleared the misunderstanding may be catalogued as follows:  (1) the self is different from prakrti and is therefore devoid of the alities of prakrti. its nature is that of the knower of prakrti. (2) the self is a sesa (sub-ordinate and servant) of the supreme person and is ruled by him. the true knowledge about the supreme person is that he is what is signified by the expression supreme brahman. (3) he is the great ocean of all auspicious, excellent attributes such as knowledge, strength, glory, valour, power, brilliance etc., which are unbounded and natural. his essence consists solely of auspiciousness. he is antagonistic to all that is evil without exception. the origin, sustentation and dissolution of the entire universe are his sport. (4) you (sri krsna) are vasudeva, the supreme person, known from the vedanta, and who can be reached only by worship, which has taken the form of bhakti. (5) bhakti can be achieved by the control of the senses and the mind, the abandonment of prohibited acts and the performance of occasional and obligatory acts as solely intended for the goal of the satisfaction of the supreme person. bhakti has to be developed day after day through the regular practice of the discriminatory knowledge of the higher and lower truths. all this has been attained by me (arjuna).  therefore i stand steadfast, freed from the doubts and devoid of the depression rooted in perverted knowledge nourished by compassion and love for relatives. now i shall fulfil your words, concerned with fighting etc., which ought to be done by me. i shall fight as instructed by you. such is the meaning.  sanjaya now relates to dhrtarastra who had estioned him earlier as to what his sons and the pandavas were doing in the battle:",
  "nastah etc.  by the passage  '[my] delusion is destroyed etc',  it is indicated that  [after hearing the lord's instruction], only an inclination  to fight has risen in arjuna, but the perfect realisation of the brahman is not yet born in him.  while indicating so, [the sage vyasa] provides a scope for the would-be subject matter for the anugita",
  "o acyuta, (my) mohah, born of ignorance and the cause of all evil in the form of mundane existence, and difficult to cross like an ocean ,l nastah has been destroyed. and smrtih, memory, regarding the reality of the self-on the acisition of which follows the loosening of all the bonds , labdha, has been regained, tvat-prasadat, through your grace maya, by me, who am dependent on your grace. by this estion about the destruction of delusion and the answer to it, it becomes conclusively revealed that the fruit derived from understanding the import of the entire scripture is this much alone-which is the destruction of delusion arising from ignorance and the regaining of the memory about the self. and similarly, in the upanisadic text beginning with 'i grieve because i am not a knower of the self' (ch. 7.1.3), it is shown that all bonds become destroyed when the self is realized. there are also the words of the upanisadic verses, 'the knot of the heart gets untied' (mu. 2.2.8) , 'at that time (or to that self) what delusion and what sorrow can there be for that seer of oneness?' (is.7). now then, sthitah, asmi, i stand under your ?nd , gata-sandehah, with (my) doubts removed. karisye, i shall follow , tava, your , vacanam, instruction. by your grace i have achieved the goal of life. the idea is, there is no duty, as such, for me. the teaching of the scripture is concluded. there-after, now in order to show the connection (of this) with the (main) narrative-",

  "he who abandons action on account of the fear of bodily trouble (because it is painful), does not obtain the merit of renunciation by doing such rajasic renunciation",
  "to avoid an action through fear of physical suffering, because it is likely to be painful, is to act from passion, and the benefit of renunciation will not follow",
  "he who would, out of fear of bodily exertion, relinish an action, just because it is painful-that person, having [thus] made relinishment, an act of the rajas (strand), would not at all gain the fruit of [that] relinishment",
  "he who renounces acts as painful from fear of bodily suffering, performs a rajasika abandonment , he does not gain the fruit of abandonment",
  "whatever action one may relinish merely as being painful, from fear of physical suffering, he, having resorted to renunciation based on rajas, will surely not acire the fruits of renunciation",
  "although actions constitute the indirect menas for release, yet they produce mental depression, since they can be done only by collecting materials involving painful effort and since they cause bodily strain on account of their reiring strenuous exertion. if, on account of such fear, one decides that the practice of knowledge alone should be tried for perfection in yoga, and abandons actions like the great sacrifices applicable to one's station in life, he practises renunciation rooted in rajas. since that is not the meaning of the sastras, one cannot win the fruit of renunciation in the form of the rise of knowledge. so it will be shown further one:  'that reason by which one erroneously knows, o arjuna, is rajasika' (18.31). in fact, actions do not directly cause purity of the mind but indirectly by winning the grace of god",

  "whatever obligatory action is done, o arjuna, merely because it ought to be done, abandoning attachment and also the desire for reward, that renunciation is regarded as sattvic (pure)",
  "he who performs an obligatory action, because he believes it to be a duty which ought to be done, without any personal desire to do the act or to receive any return - such renunciation is pure",
  "'this is a thing to be performed.'-just on that ground whatever usual action is performed relinishing attachment and also fruit-that act of relinishment is deemed to be of the sattva (strand)",
  "when actions are performed as what ought to be done, o arjuna, renouncing attachment and also fruits, such abandonment is regarded as sattvika",
  "whatever obligatory duty is performed just because it is a bounden duty, o arjuna, by giving up attachment and the result as well,-that renunciation is considered to be based on sattva",
  "when rites like obligatory and occasional ceremonies and the great sacrifices enjoined on one's station and stage in life, are practised for their own sake, as worship of myself and as a duty, relinishing possessiveness and fruits - such abandonment is regarded as sattvika. it is noted in sattva. the idea is that it is rooted in the knowledge of the meaning of the sastras as it really is. that sattva generates the knowledge of things as they really are, has been taught in:  'from sattva arises knowledge' (14.17), and it will be further declared:  'that reason by which one knows action and renunciation, what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, fear and fearlessness, bondage and release, o arjuna, is sattvika' (18.30)",
  "yat, whatever , niyatam karma, daily obligatory duty , kriyate, is performed, accomplished , iti eva, just because , it is karyam, a bounden duty , o arjuna, tyaktva, by giving up , sangam, attachment , and phalam, the result , ca eva, as well , sah, that , tyagah, renunciation, giving up of attachment and (hankering for) the resutls of daily obligatory duties , matah, is considered , to be sattvikah, based on sattva, arising from sattva. we said that the lord's utterance is proof of the fruitfulness of daily obligatory duties. or, even if the niyakarmas be understood (from the lord's worlds) to be fruitless, still the ignorant man does certainly imagine that the nityakarmas (daily obligatory duites) when performed produce for oneself a result either in the form of purification of the mind or avoidance of evil. as to this, the lord aborts even that imagination by saying, 'by giving up the result'. hence it has been well said, 'by giving up attachment and the result'. objection: well, is not the threefold relinishment of actions, also called sannyasa, under discussion? as regards this, the renunciation based on tamas and rajas have been stated. why is the relinishment of attachment and (desire for their) results spoken of here as the third? this is like somody saying, 'three brahmanas have come. of them two are versed in the six auxiliaries [the six auxiliaries are: siksa (phonetics), kalpa (code of rituals and sacrifices), vyakarana (grammar), nirukta (etymology), chandas (meter, prosody), and jyotisa (astronomy).-tr.] of the vedas , the third is a ksatirya!' reply: this is not wrong, for this is meant as a eulogy on the basis of the common factor of renunciation. between renunciation of actions and renunciation. of hankering for results, there is, indeed, the similarity of the fact of renunciation. while on this subject, by condemning 'renunciation of actions' on account of its being based on rajas and tamas, the 'renunciation of desire for results of actions' is being praised on account of its being based on sattva, by saying, 'that renunciation is considered to be based on sattva.' the internal organ of a person who is alified for rites and duties, who performs the nityakarmas by giving up attachment and hankering for results, becomes pure on account of its being untainted by attachment to results etc. and refined by the nitya-karmas. when it is pure and tranil, it becomes capable of contemplating on the self. since, for that very person whose internal organ has become purified by performing the nityakarmas and who has become ready for the knowledge of the self, the process by which he can become steadfast in it has to be stated, therefore the lord says:",
  "sanjaya said  to him who was thus overcome with pity and who was despondent, with eyes full of tears and agitated, madhusudana (the destroyer of madhu) or krishna spoke these words",
  "sanjaya then told how the lord shri krishna, seeing arjuna overwhelmed with compassion, his eyes dimmed with flowing tears and full of despondency, consoled him:",

  " sanjaya said - lord said  when arjuna thus sat, the lord, opposing his action, said:  'what is the reason for your misplaced grief?  arise for battle, abandoning this grief, which has arisen in a critical situation, which can come only in men of wrong understanding, which is an obstacle for reaching heaven, which does not confer fame on you, which is very mean, and which is caused by faint-heartedness",
  "to him who was despondent in the midst of the two armies, krishna, as if smiling, o bharata, spoke these words",
  "thereupon the lord, with a gracious smile, addressed him who was so much depressed in the midst of the two armies",
  "o descendant of bharata  (o dhrtarastra) !  hrsikesa,  as if  [he was]  smiling, spoke to him who was sinking in despondency in between two armies",
  "o king, to him who was thus sorrowing between the two armies, sri krsna spoke the following words, as if smiling (by way of ridicule)",
  "o descendant of bharata, to him who was sorrowing between the two armies, hrsikesa, mocking as it were, said these words:",
  " sanjaya said  thus, the lord, the supreme person, introduced the sastra regarding the self for the sake of arjuna - whose natural courage was lost due to love and compassion in a misplaced situation, who thought war to be unrighteous even though it was the highest duty for warriors (ksatriyas), and who took refuge in sri krsna to know what his right duty was -, thinking that arjuna's delusion would not come to an end except by the knowledge of the real nature of the self, and that war was an ordained duty here which, when freed from attachment to fruits, is a means for self-knowledge. thus,  has it been said by sri yamunacarya: 'the introduction to the sastra was begun for the sake of arjuna, whose mind was agitated by misplaced love and compassion and by the delusion that righteousness was unrighteousness, and who took refuge in sri krsna.'   the supreme person spoke these words as if smiling, and looking at arjuna, who was thus overcome by grief resulting from ignorance about the real nature of the body and the self, but was nevertheless speaking about duty as if he had an understanding that the self is distinct from the body, and while he (arjuna), torn between contradictory ideas, had suddenly become inactive standing between the two armies that were getting ready to fight. sri krsna said, as if in ridicule, to arjuna the words beginning with, 'there never was a time when i did not exist' (ii. 12), and ending with 'i will release you from all sins , grieve not!' (xviii. 66) - which have for their contents the real nature of the self, of the supreme self, and of the paths of work (karma), knowledge (jnana) and devotion (bhakti) which constitute the means for attaining the highest spiritual fulfilment",
  " karpanya-etc. upto vacah. by the portion  'in between the two armies' etc., [the sage] indicates this : beings possessed by doubt, arjuna had not abstained from the war totally ,  for, he says thus : 'please teach me, who am taking refuge in you'.  therefore while he still remains just in between both knowledge and ignorance, he is taught by the glorious bhagavat",
  "and here, the text commencing from 'but seeing the army of the pandavas' (1.2) and ending with '(he) verily became silent, telling him (govinda), 'i shall not fight'' is to be explained as revealing the cause of the origin of the defect in the from of sorrow, delusion, etc. [delusion means want of discrimination. etc. stands for the secondary manifestations of sorrow and delusion, as also ignorance which is the root cause of all these.] which are the sources of the cycles of births and deaths of creatures. thus indeed, ajuna's own sorrow and delusion, cuased by the ideas of affection, parting, etc., originating from the erroneous belief, 'i belong to these , they belong to me', with regard to kingdom [see note under verse 8.-tr.], elders, sons, comrades, well-wishers (1.26), kinsmen (1.37), relatives (1.34) and friends, have been shown by him with the words, 'how can i (fight)৷৷.in battle (against) bhisma' (4), etc. it is verily because his discriminating insight was overwhelmed by sorrow and delusion that, even though he had become engaged in battle out of his own accord as a duty of the ksatriyas, he desisted from that war and chose to undertake other's duties like living on alms etc. it is thus that in the case of all creatures whose minds come under the sway of the defects of sorrow, delusion, etc. there verily follows, as a matter of course, abandoning their own duties and resorting to prohibited ones. even when they engage in their own duties their actions with speech, mind, body, etc., are certainly motivated by hankering for rewards, and are accompanied by egoism. [egoism consists in thinking that one is the agent of some work and the enjoyer of its reward.] such being the case, the cycle of births and deaths  characterized by passing through desireable and undesirable births, and meeting with happiness, sorrow, etc. [from virtuous deeds follow attainment of heaven and happiness. from unvirtuous, sinful deeds follow births as beasts and other lowly beings, and sorrow. from the performance of both virtuous and sinful deeds follows birth as a human being, with a mixture of happiness and sorrow.] from the accumulation of virtue and vice, continues unendingly. thus, sorrow and delusion are therefore the sources of the cycles of births and deaths. and their cessation comes from nothing other than the knowledge of the self which is preceded by the renunciation of all duties. hence, wishing to impart that (knowledge of the self) for favouring the whole world, lord vasudeva, making arjuna the medium, said, 'you grieve for those who are not to be grieved for,' etc. as to that some (opponents) [according to a.g. the opponent is the vrttikara who, in the opinion of a. mahadeva sastri, is none other than bodhayana referred to in sankaracarya's commentary on b.s. 1.1.11-19.-tr.] say: certainly, liberation cannot be attained merely from continuance in the knowledge of the self which is preceded by renunciation of all duties and is independent of any other factor. what then? the well-ascertained conclusion of the whole of the gita is that liberation is attained through knowledge associated with rites and duties like agnihotra etc. prescribed in the vedas and the smrtis. and as an indication of this point of view they ote (the verses): 'on the other hand, if you will not fight this righteous (battle)' (33) , 'your right is for action (rites and duties) alone' (47) , 'therefore you undertake action (rites and duties) itself' (4.15), etc. even this objection should not be raised that vedic rites and duties lead to sin since they involve injury etc.'. objection: how? opponent: the duties of the ksatriyas, charaterized by war, do not lead to sin when undertaken as one's duty, even though they are extremely cruel since they involve violence against elders, brothers, sons and others. and from the lord's declaration that when they are not performed, 'then, forsaking your own duty and fame, you will incur sin' (33), it stands out as (his) clearly stated foregone conclusion that one's own duties prescribed in such texts as, '(one shall perform agnihotra) as long as one lives' etc., and actions which involve crutely to animals etc. are not sinful. vedantin: that is wrong because of the assertion of the distinction between firm adherence (nistha) to knowledge and to action, which are based on two (different) convictions (buddhi). the nature of the self, the supreme reality, determined by the lord in the text beginning with 'those who are not to be grieved for' (11) and running to the end of the verse, 'even considering your own duty' (31), is called sankhya. sankhya-buddhi [sankhya is that correct (samyak) knowledge of the vedas which reveals (khyayate) the reality of the self, the supreme goal. the reality under discussion, which is related to this sankhya by way of having been revealed by it, is sankhya.] (conviction about the reality) is the conviction with regard to that (supreme reality) arising from the ascertainment of the meaning of the context [ascertainment৷৷.of the context, i.e., of the meaning of the verses starting from, 'never is this one born, and never does it die,' etc. (20).]  that the self is not an agent because of the absence in it of the six kinds of changes, viz birth etc. [birth, continuance, growth, transformation, decay and death.] sankhyas are those men of knowledge to whom that (conviction) becomes natural. prior to the rise of this conviction (sankhya-buddhi), the ascertained [ast. and a.g. omit this word 'ascertainment, nirupana'-tr.] of the performance of the disciplines leading to liberation  which is based on a discrimination between virtue and vice, [and adoration of god]. and which presupposes the self's difference from the body etc. and its agentship and enjoyership  is called yoga. the conviction with regard to that (yoga) is yoga-buddhi. the performers of rites and duties, for whom this (conviction) is appropriate, are called yogis. accordingly, the two distinct convictions have been pointed out by the lord in the verse, 'this wisdom (buddhi) has been imparted to you from the standpoint of self-realization (sankhya). but listen to this (wisdom) from the standpoint of (karma-) yoga' (39). and of these two, the lord will separately speak, with reference to the sankhyas, of the firm adherence to the yoga of knowledge. [here yoga and knowledge are identical. yoga is that through which one gets connected, identified. with brahman.] which is based on sankya-buddhi, in, 'two kinds of adherences were spoken of by me in the form of the vedas, in the days of yore.' [this portion is ascending to g1.pr. and a.a. , ast. omits this and otes exactly the first line of 3.3. by saying, 'in the form of the vedas', the lord indicates that the vedas, which are really the knowledge inherent in god and issue out of him, are identical with himself.-tr.] similarly, in, 'through the yoga of action for the yogis' (3.3), he will separately speak of the firm adherence to the yoga [here also karma and yoga are identical, and lead to liberation by bringing about purity of heart which is followed by steadfastness in knowledge.] of karma which is based on yoga-buddhi (conviction about yoga). thus, the two kinds of steadfastness  that based on the conviction about the nature of the self, and that based on the conviction about rites and duties  have been distinctly spoken of by the lord himself, who saw that the coexistence of knowledge and rites and duties is not possible in the same person, they being based on the convictions of non-agentship and agentship, unity and diversity (respectively). as is this teaching about the distinction (of the two adherences), just so has it been revealed in the satapatha brahmana: 'desiring this world (the self) alone monks and brahmanas renounce their homes' (cf. br. 4.4.22). after thus enjoining renunciation of all rites and duties, it is said in continuation, 'what shall we acheive through childeren, we who have attained this self, this world (result).' [the earlier otation implies an injuction (vidhi) for renunciation, and the second is an arthavada, or an emphasis on that injunction. arthavada: a sentence which usually recommends a vidhi, or precept, by stating the good arising from its proper observance, and the evils arising from its omission , and also by adducing historical instances in its support.-v.s.a] again, there itself it is said that, before accepting a wife a man is in his natural state [the state of ignorance owing to non-realization of reality. such a person is a brahmacarin, who goes to a teacher for studying the vedas]. and (then) after his eniries into rites and duties, [the brahmacarin first studies the vedas and then enires into their meaning. leaving his teacher's house after completing his course, he becomes a house holder.] 'he' for the attainment of the three worlds [this world, the world of manes and heaven.-tr.] 'desired' (see br. 1.4.17) as their means a son and the two kinds of wealth consists of rites and duties that lead to the world of manes, and the divine wealth of acisition of vidya (meditation) which leads to heaven. in this way it is shown that rites and duties enjoined by the vedas etc. are meant only for one who is unenlightened and is passessed of desire. and in the text, 'after renouncing they take to mendicancy' (see br. 4.4.22), the injunction to renounce is only for one who desires the world that is the self, and who is devoid of hankering (for anything else). now, if the intention of the lord were the combination of knowledge with vedic rites and duties, then this utterance (of the lord) (3.3) about the distinction would have been illogical. nor would arjuna's estion, 'if it be your opinion that wisdom (knowledge) is superior to action (rites and duties)৷৷.,' etc. (3.1) be proper. if the lord had not spoken earlier of the impossibility of the pursuit of knowledge and rites and duties by the same person (at the same time), then how could arjuna falsely impute to the lord  by saying, 'if it be your opinion that wisdom is superior to action৷৷৷৷'  (of having spoken) what was not heard by him, viz the higher status of knolwedge over rites and duties? morevoer, if it be that the combination of knowledge with rites and duties was spoken of for all, then it stands enjoined, ipso facto, on arjuna as well. therefore, if instruction had been given for practising both, then how could the estion about 'either of the two' arise as in, 'tell me for certain one of these (action and renunciation) by which i may attain the highest good' (3.2)? indeed, when a physician tells a patient who has come for a cure of his biliousness that he should take things which are sweet and soothing, there can arise no such reest as, 'tell me which one of these two is to be taken as a means to cure biliousness'! again, if it be imagined that arjuna put the estion because of his noncomprehension of the distinct meaning of what the lord had said, even then the lord ought to have answered in accordance with the estion: 'the combination of knowledge with rites and duties was spoken of by me. why are you confused thus?' on the other hand, it was not proper to have answered, 'two kinds of steadfastness were spoken of by me it the days of yore,' in a way that was inconsistent and at variance with the estion. nor even do all the statements about distinction etc. become logical if it were intended that knowledge was to be combined with rites and duties enjoined by the smrtis only. besides, the accusation in the sentence, 'why then do you urge me to horrible action' (3.1) becomes illogical on the part of arjuna who knew that fighting was a ksatriya's natural duty enjoined by the smrtis. therefore, it is not possible for anyone to show that in the scripture called the gita there is any combination, even in the least, of knowledge of the self with rites and duties enjoined by the srutis or the smrtis. but in the case of a man who had engaged himself in rites and duties because of ignorance and defects like the attachment, and then got his mind purified through sacrifices, charities or austerities (see br. 4.4.22), there arises the knowledge about the supreme reality  that all this is but one, and brahman is not an agent (of any action). with regard to him, although there is a cessation of rites and duties as also of the need for them, yet, what may, appear as his diligent continuance, just as before, in those rites and duties for setting an example before people  that is no action in which case it could have stood combined with knowledge. just as the actions of lord vasudeva, in the form of performance of the duty of a ksatriya, do not get combined with knowledge for the sake of achieving the human goal (liberation), similar is the case with the man of knowledge because of the absence of hankering for results and agentship. indeed, a man who has realized the truth does not thingk 'i am doing (this)' nor does he hanker after its result. again, as for instance, person hankering after such desirable things as heaven etc. may light up a fire for performing such rites as agnihotra etc. which are the mans to attain desirable things , [the ast. reading is: agnihotradi-karma-laksana-dharma-anusthanaya, for the performance of duties in the form of acts like agnihotra etc.-tr.] then, while he is still engaged in the performance of agnihotra etc. as the means for the desirable things, the desire may get destroyed when the rite is half-done. he may nevertheless continue the performance of those very agnihotra etc. , but those performance of those very agnihotra etc. , but those agnihotra etc. cannot be held to be for this personal gain.  accordingly does the lord also show in various places that, 'even while perfroming actions,' he does not act, 'he does not become tainted' (5.7). as for the texts, '৷৷.as was performed earlier by the ancient ones' (4.15), 'for janaka and others strove to attain liberation through action itself' (3.20), they are to be understood analytically. objection: how so? vedantin: as to that, if janaka and others of old remained engaged in activity even though they were knowers of reality, they did so for preventing people from going astray, while remaining established in realization verily through the knowledge that 'the organs rest (act) on the objects of the organs' (3.28). the idea is this that, though the occasion for renunciation of activity did arise, they remained established in realization along with actions , they did not give up their rites and duties. on the other hand, if they were not knowers of reality, then the explanation should be this , through the discipline of dedicating rites and duties to god, janaka and others remained established in perfection (samsiddhi) either in the form of purification of mind or rise of knowledge. this very idea [the idea that rites and duties become the cause of knowledge through the purification of the mind.] will be expressed by the lord in, '(the yogis) undertake action for the purification of oneself (i.e. of the heart, or the mind)' (5.11). after having said, 'a human being achieves success by adoring him through his own duties' [by performing one's own duty as enjoined by scriptures and dedicating their results to god, one's mind becomes purified. then, through gods grace one becomes fit for steadfastness in knowledge. from that steadfatness follows liberation. therefore rites and duites do not directly lead to liberation. (see common. under 5.12) (18.46), he will again speak of the steadfastness in knowledge of a person who has attained success, in the text, '(understand৷৷.from me৷৷.that process by which) one who has achieved success attains brahman' (18.50). so, the definite conclusion in the gita is that liberation is attained only from the knowledge of reality, and not from its combination with action. and by pointing out in the relevant contexts the (aforesaid) distinction, we shall show how this conclusion stands. that being so, lord vasudeva found that for arjuna, whose mind was thus confused about what ought to be done [the ast. and a.a., have an additional word  mithyajnanavatah, meaning 'who had false ignorance'.-tr.] and who was sunk in a great ocean of sorrow, there could be no rescue other than through the knowledge of the self. and desiring to rescue arjuna from that, he said, '(you grieve for) those who are not to be grieved for,' etc. by way of introducing the knowledge of the self. [in this gita there are three distinct parts, each part consisting of six chapters. these three parts deal with the three words of the great upanisadic saying, 'tattvamasi, thou art that', with a view to finding out their real meanings. the first six chapters are concerned with the word tvam (thou) , the following six chapters determine the meaning of the word tat (that) , and the last six reveal the essential identity of tvam and tat. the disciplines necessary for realization this identity are stated in the relevant places.]",
  "the blessed lord said  thou hast grieved for those that should not be grieved for, yet thou speakest words of wisdom. the wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead",

  "the lord said  you are grieving for those who do not deserve to be grieved for. you also speak words of wisdom about the nature of the body and the self as follows:  'the ancestors fall degraded, deprived of the ritual oblations of food and water' (i. 42). there is no reason for such grief for those who possess the knowledge of the nature of the body and the self. those who know the exact truth will not grieve for those bodies from which life has departed and for those from whome the principle of life has not departed. they do not grieve for bodies or souls.  hence, in you this contradiction is visible - your grief at the thought 'i shall slay them?'  and at the same time your talk about righteousness and unrighteousness, as if it were the result of knowledge of the self as distinct from the body. therefore you do not know the nature of the body nor of the self which is distinct from the body and is eternal. nor do you know of duties like war etc., which (as duty) constitute the means for the attainment of the self, nor of the fact that this war (which forms a duty in the present context), if fought without any selfish desire for results, is a means for the attainment of the knowledge of the true nature of the self.  the implied meaning is this:  this self, verily, is not dependent on the body for its existence, nor is it subjected to destruction on the death of the body, as there is no birth or death for it. therefore there is no cause for grief. but the body is insentient by nature, is subject to change, and its birth and death are natural , thus it (body) too is not to be grieved for.  first listen about the nature of the self",
  "asocyan etc.  you lament for the body that cannot be lamented over, because it is of incessantly perishing nature , and also for the soul that does not reire to be lamented.  no one, either of departed life, i.e., the dead, or of non-departed life, i.e.,  the living, is to be mourned for.  as for instance, the soul is ever non-perishing.   what sort of lamentability can be for it,  as it is plessantly travelling in different bodies ?  nor is it right to say that its lamentability is due only to its travel in another body.  for, in that case,  it should be lamented for, even when the stage of youth etc., is attained.   in this manner, the two ideas [the lord] relates :",

  "nor at any time indeed was i not, nor thou, nor these rulers of men, nor verily shall we ever cease to be hereafter",
  "there was never a time when i was not, nor thou, nor these princes were not , there will never be a time when we shall cease to be",
  "never indeed at any time [in the past] did i not exist,  nor you,  nor these kings , and never shall we all not exist hereafter",
  "there never was a time when i did not exist, nor you, nor any of these kings of men. nor will there be any time in future when all of us shall cease to be",
  "but certainly (it is) not (a fact) that i did not exist at any time , nor you, nor these rulers of men. and surely it is not that we all shall cease to exist after this",
  "indeed, i, the lord of all, who is eternal, was never non-existent, but existed always. it is not that these selves like you, who are subject to my lordship, did not exist , you have always existed. it is not that 'all of us', i and you, shall cease to be 'in the future', i.e., beyond the present time , we shall always exist. even as no doubt can be entertainted that i, the supreme self and lord of all, am eternal, likewise, you (arjuna and all others) who are embodied selves, also should be considered eternal.  the foregoing implies that the difference between the lord, the sovereign over all, and the individual selves, as also the differences among the individual selves themselves, are real. this has been declared by the lord himself. for, different terms like 'i', 'you', 'these', 'all' and 'we' have been used by the lord while explaining the truth of eternality in order to remove the misunderstanding of arjuna who is deluded by ignorance.  [now follows a refutation of the upadhi theory of bhaskara and the ignorance theory of the advaitins which deny any ultimate difference between the lord and the jivas.]  if we examine (bhaskara's) theory of upadhis (adjuncts), which states that the apparent differences among jivas are due to adjuncts, it will have to be admitted that mention about differences is out of place when explaining the ultimate truth, because the theory holds that there are no such differences in reality. but that the differences mentioned by the lord are natural, is taught by the sruti also:  'eternal among eternals, sentient among sentients, the one, who fulfils the desires of the many' (sve. u. vi. 13, ka. u. v. 13).  the meaning of the text is:  among the eternal sentient beings who are countless, he, who is the supreme spirit, fulfils the desires of all.'  as regards the theory of the advaitins that the perception of difference is brought about by ignorance only and is not really real, the supreme being - whose vision must be true and who, therefore must have an immediate cognition of the differencelss and immutable and eternal consciousness as constituting the nature of the atman in all authenticity, and who must thery be always free from all ignorance and its effects - cannot possibly perceive the so-called difference arising from ignornace. it is, therefore, unimaginable that he engages himself in activities such as teaching, which can proceed only from such a perception of differences arising from ignorance.  the argument that the supreme being, though possessed of the understanding of nom-duality, can still have the awareness of such difference persisting even after sublation, just as a piece of cloth may have been burnt up and yet continues to have the appearance of cloth, and that such a continuance of the subltated does not cause bondage - such an argument is invalid in the light of another analogy of a similar kind, namely, the perception of the mirage, which, when understood to be what it is, does not make one endeavour to fetch water therefrom. in the same way even if the impression of difference negated by the non-dualistic illumination persists, it cannot impel one to activities such as teaching , for the object to whom the instruction is to be imparted is discovered to be unreal. the idea is that just as the discovery of the non-existence of water in a mirage stops all effort to get water from it, so also when all duality is sublated by illumination, no activity like teaching disciples etc., can take place.  nor can the lord be conceived as having been previously ignorant and as attaining knowledge of unity through the scirptures, and as still being subject to the continuation of the stultified experiences. such a position would stand in contradiction to the sruti and the smrti:  'he, who is all-comprehender' (mun. u., 1. 1. 9) , all knower and supreme and natural power of varied types are spoken of in srutis, such as knowledge, strength and action' (sve. u. 6. 8) , 'i know, arjuna, all beings of the past, present and future but no one knows me,' etc. (gita 7. 26).  and again, if the perception of difference and distinction are said to persist even after the unitary self has been decisively understood, the estion will arise - to whom will the lord and the succession of teachers of the tradition impart the knowledge in accordance with their understanding?  the estion needs an answer. the idea is that knowledge of non-duality and perception of differences cannot co-exist. if it be replied by advaitins holding the bimba-pratibimba (the original and reflections) theory that teachers give instructions to their own reflections in the form of disciples such as arjuna, it would amount to an absurdity.  for, no one who is not out of his senses would undertake to give any instruction to his own reflections in mediums such as a precious stone, the blade of a sword or a mirror, knowing, as he does, that they are non-different from himself. the theory of the persistence of the sublated is thus impossible to maintain, as the knowledge of the unitary self destroys the beginningless ignorance in which differences falling outside the self are supposed to be rooted. 'the persistence of the sublated' does occur in cases such as the vision of the two moons, where the cause of the vision is the result of some real defect in eyesight, nor removable by the right understanding of the singleness of the moon. even though the perception of the two moons may continue, the sublated cognition is rendered inconseential on the strength of strong contrary evidence. for, it will not lead to any activity appropriate for a real experience.  but in the present context (i.e. the advaitic), the conception of difference, whose object and cause are admittedly unreal, is cancelled by the knowledge of reality. so the 'persistence of the sublated' can in no way happen. thus, if the supreme lord and the present succession of preceptors have attained the understanding of (non-dual) reality, their perception of difference and work such as teaching proceeding from that perception, are impossible. if, on the other hand, the perception of difference persists because of the continuance of ignorance and its cause, then these teachers are themselves ignorant of the truth, and they will be incapable of teaching the truth.  further, as the preceptor has attained the knowledge of the unitary self and thery the ignorance concerning brahman and all the effects of such ignorance are thus annihilated, there is no purpose in instructing the disciple. it it is held that the preceptor and his knowledge are just in the imagination of the disciple, the disciple and his knowledge are similarly the product of the imagination of the preceptor, and as such can not put an end to the ignorance in estion. if it is maintained that the disciple's knowledge destroys ignorance etc., because it contradicts the antecedent state of non-enlightenment, the same can be asserted of the preceptor's knowledge. the futility of such teachings is obvious. enough of these unsound doctrines which have all been refuted",
  "why are they not to be grieved for? because they are eternal. how? na tu eva, but certainly it is not (a fact) , that jatu, at any time , aham, i  , na asam, did not exist , on the contrary, i did exist. the idea is that when the bodies were born or died in the past, i existed eternally.

  "just as in this body the embodied (soul) passes into childhood, youth and old age, so also does it pass into another body , the firm man does not grieve thereat",
  "as the soul experiences in this body infancy, youth and old age, so finally it passes into another. the wise have no delusion about this",
  "just as the boyhood,  youth and old age come to the embodied soul in this body, in the same manner is the attaining of another body ,  the wise man is not deluded at that",
  "just as the self associated with a body passes through childhood, youth and old age (pertaining to that body), so too (at death) it passes into another body. a wise man is not deluded by that",
  "as are boyhood, youth and decrepitude to an embodied being in this (present) body, similar is the acisition of another body. this being so, an intelligent person does not get deluded",
  "as the self is eternal, one does not grieve, thinking that the self is lost, when an embodied self living in a body gives up the state of childhood and attains youth and other states. similarly, the wise men, knowing that the self is eternal, do not grieve, when the self attains a body different from the present body. hence the selves, being eternal, are not fit objects for grief.  this much has to be done here , the eternal selves because of their being subject ot beginningless karma become endowed with bodies suited to their karmas. to get rid of this bondage (of bodies), embodied beings perform duties like war appropriate to their stations in life with the help of the same bodies in an attitude of detachment from the fruits as prescribed by the scripture. even to such aspirants, contacts with sense-objects give pleasure and pain, arising from cold, heat and such other things. but these experiences are to be endured till the acts enjoined in the scriptures come to an end.  the lord explains the significance immediately afterwards:",
  " na hi etc. dehinah etc never indeed did i not exist, but i did exist [always].  likewise are you and these kings.  if there can be lamentability for one, on attaining change in physical form then why is one not lamented over when one attains the youth from the boyhood ?  he, who is wise, does not lament.  but, wisdom is easily attainable for him whose concern is not even for this [present] body.  therefore you must seek wisdom",
  "as to that, to show how the self is eternal, the lord cites an illustration by saying,'৷৷.of the embodied,' etc. yatha, as are, the manner in which , kaumaram, boyhood , yauvanam, youth, middle age , and jara, decrepitude, advance of age , dehinah, to an embodied being, to one who possesses a body (deha), to the self possessing a body , asmin, in this, present , dehe, body . these three states are mutually distinct. on these, when the first state gets destroyed the self does not get destroyed , when the second state comes into being it is not born. what then? it is seen that the self, which verily remains unchanged, acires the second and third states. tatha, similar, indeed , is its, the unchanging self's dehantarapraptih, acisition of another body, a body different from the present one. this is the meaning. tatra, this being so , dhirah, an intelligent person , na, does not , muhyati, get deluded",

  "matra etc.  but the unwise lament even over those passing situations of cold and heat, pleasure and pain that are created by those touches i.e., the contacts of the sense-objects-referable with the term matra - with the soul through the door of the sense-organs , but the wise do not do so.  thus says [the lord].  or, the passage may be interpreted as :  the touches (contacts) of these objects are with the matras, i.e., with the sense-organs, and not directly with the supreme self,  coming : birth.  going : destruction, those situations that have these two you must forbear i.e., put up with",
  "'in the case of a man who knows that the self is eternal, although there is no possibility of delusion concerning the destruction of the self, still delusion, as of ordinary people, caused by the experience of cold, heat, happiness and sorrow is noticed in him. delusion arises from being deprived of happiness, and sorrow arises from contact with pain etc.' apprehending this kind of a talk from arjuna, the lord said, 'but the contacts of the organs,' etc. matra-sparsah, the contacts of the organs with objects , are sita-usna-sukha-duhkha-dah, producers of cold, heat, happiness and sorrow. matrah means those by which are marked off (measured up) sounds etc., i.e. the organs of hearing etc. the sparsah, contacts, of the organs with sound etc. are matra-sparsah. or, sparsah means those which are contacted, i.e. objects, viz sound etc. matra-sparsah, the organs and objects, are the producers of cold, heat, happiness and sorrow. cold sometimes produces pleasure, and sometimes pain. similarly the nature of heat, too, is unpredictable. on the other hand, happiness and sorrow have definite natures since they do not change. hence they are mentioned separately from cold and heat. since they, the organs, the contacts, etc., agamapayinah, have a beginning and an end, are by nature subject to origination and destruction , therefore, they are anityah, transient. hence, titiksasva, bear , tan, them  cold, heart, etc., i.e. do not be happy or sorry with regard to them",
  "that firm man whom, surely, these afflict not, o chief among men, to whom pleasure and pain are the same, is fit for attaining immortality",
  "the hero whose soul is unmoved by circumstance, who accepts pleasure and pain with equanimity, only he is fit for immortality",
  "o the best among persons !  that wise person becomes immortal whom these (situations) do not trouble and to whom the pleasure and pain are eal",
  "for, he whom these do not affect, o chief of men, and to whom pain and pleasure are the same - that steadfast man alone is worthy of immortality",
  "o (arjuna, who are) foremost among men, verily, the person whom these do not torment, the wise man to whom sorrow and happhiness are the same  he is fit for immortality",
  "that person endowed with courage, who considers pain as inevitable as pleasure, and who performs war and such other acts suited to his station in life without attachment to the results and only as a means of attaining immortality - one whom the impact of weapons in war etc., which involve soft or harsh contacts, do not trouble, that person only attains immortality, not a person like you, who cannnot bear grief. as the selves are immortal, what is to be done here, is this much only. this is the meaning.  because of the immortality of the selves and the natural destructibility of the bodies, there is no cause for grief. it was told (previously):  'the wise grieve neither for the dead nor for the living' (2. 11). now the lord elucidates the same view",
  "but, because all these different situations are of the nature of coming and going, on that account itself are they not to be lamented on ?  it is not so.  as for instance :  what is this which is termed  'coming' ?  if it is  'birth', what is that  'birth' itself ?  it is wrong to say that is the same as gaining the self by what is non-existent.  for, to be of the nature of non-existence, is indeed to be devoid of every inherent nature and to be devoid of the very self.  if a thing is devoid of the self and devoid of every nature, how is it possible to convert it into what has an intrinsic nature ?  surely, it is impossible to  convert  the non-blue into blue.  for, it is faulty and undesirable to covert  the non-blue into blue. for, it is faulty and undesirable to conclude that a thing  with certain in nature changes to be of a different nature.  hence the scritpure goes -  'the intrinsic nature of beings would not cease to exist, e.g., the heat of the sun'.   on the other hand, if the 'birth' signifies the gaining of self just by what [really] exists, even then, why the lamentability on its coming ?  for, what has gained a self, could never be non-existent and conseently it would be eternal.   likewise, is the act of  'going' also meant for the existent or the non-existent ?  what is non-existent is just non-existent  [for ever.]  how can there be a non-existence-nature even in the case of  that which is of the existence-nature ?  if it is said that it is of the non-existence-nature in the second moment , [since its birth], then it should be so even in the first moment , and so nothing would be existent.  for, the intrinsic nature  [ever] remains unabandoned.   but is it not that the destruction of it  (i.e., of a given thing, like a pot) is brought about by the stroke of a hammer etc.?  yet, if that destruction is altogether different [from the existent one i.e. the pot], then what does it matter for what is existent ?  but, it is not be seen  [at that time] ?  yet, what is actually existent (pot) may not be seen just as when it is covered with a cloth , but it has not turned to be altogether different.  in fact, it has been said [in the scriptures] that this is not different  [from the existent].  summarising all these, [the lord] says -",

'the real,' that is, the self, can never cease to be. the finale about these, the body and the self, which can be experienced, has been realised correctly by the seers of the truth. as analyis ends in conclusion, the term 'finale' is here used. the meaning is this:  non-existence (i.e., perishableness) is the real nature of the body which is in itself insentient. existence (i.e., imperishableness) is the real nature of the self, which is sentient. [what follows is the justification of describing the body as 'unreal' and as having 'never come into being.']  non-existence has, indeed, the nature of perishableness, and existence has the nature of imperishableness, as bhagavan parasara has said:  'o brahmana, apart from conscious entity there does not exist any group of things anywhere and at any time. thus have i taught you what is real existence - how conscious entity is real, and all else is unreal' (v. p., 2.12.43 - 45). 'the supreme reality is considered as imperishable by the wise. there is no doubt that what can be obtained from a perishable substance is also perishable' (ibid., 2.14.24). 'that entity which even by a change in time cannot come to possess a difference through modification etc., is real. what is that entity, o king?  (it is the self who retains its knowledge)' (ibid., 2.13.100).  it is said here also:  'these bodies ৷৷. are said to have an end' (2.18) and 'know that (the atman) to be indestructible' (2.17). it is seen from this that this (i.e., perishableness of the body and imperishableness of the self) is the reason for the designating the atman as 'existence' (sattva) and body as 'non-existence' (asvattva). this verse has no reference to the doctrine of satkaryavada (i.e., the theory that effects are present in the cause), as such a theory has no relevance here. arjuna is deluded about the true nature of the body and the self , so what ought to be taught to him in order to remove his delusion, is discrimination between these two - what is alified by perishablenss and what, by imperishableness. this (declaration) is introduced in the following way:  'for the dead, or for the living' (2.11).  again this poin is made clear immediately (by the words), 'know that to be indestructible ৷৷.' (2.17) and 'these bodies ৷৷. are said to have an end' (2.18).  how the imperishableness of the self is to be understood, sri krsna now teaches:",
  "nasatah etc. and then, also following the common worldly practice [the lord] says this :  there is no [real] existence for what is non-existent i.e., the body [etc.], that is continuously perishing , for it is changing incessantly by stages.  again, never there is destruction for the ever existing supreme self, because of its unchanging nature.  so says the veda too :     'lo ! this soul is of unchanging nature and [hence]         is destructions' (the br. u, iv, v. 14).    of  these two : of what is existent and what is non-existent.   finality :  the point of  boundary  where they come to an end.\t    but is this permanent or transient which is perceived by persons who are prone to see the truth ?  having raised this doubt,  [the lord] says :",
  "since 'the unreal has no being,' etc., for this reason also it is proper to bear cold, heat, etc. without becoming sorrowful or deluded. asatah, of the unreal, of cold, heat, etc. together with their causes , na vidyate, there is no , bhavah, being, existence, reality , because heat, cold, etc. together with their causes are not substantially real when tested by means of proof. for they are changeful, and whatever is changeful is inconstant. as configurations like pot etc. are unreal since they are not perceived to be different from earth when tested by the eyes, so also are all changeful things unreal because they are not perceived to be different from their (material) causes, and also because they are not perceived before (their) origination and after destruction. objection: if it be that [here ast. has the additional words 'karyasya ghatadeh, the effect, viz pot etc. (and)'.-tr.] such (material) causes as earth etc. as also their causes are unreal since they are not perceived differently from their causes, in that case, may it not be urged that owing to the nonexistence of those (causes) there will arise the contingency of everything becoming unreal [an entity cannot be said to be unreal merely because it is non-different from its cause. were it to be asserted as being unreal, then the cause also should be unreal, because there is no entity which is not subject to the law of cuase and effect.]? vedantin: no, for in all cases there is the experience of two awarenesses, viz the awareness of reality, and the awareness of unreality. [in all cases of perception two awarenesses are involved: one is invariable, and the other is variable. since the variable is imagined on the invariable, therefore it is proved that there is something which is the substratum of all imagination, and which is neither a cause nor an effect.] that in relation to which the awareness does not change is real , that in relation to which it changes is unreal. thus, since the distinction between the real and the unreal is dependent on awareness, therefore in all cases (of empirical experiences) everyone has two kinds of awarenesses with regard to the same substratum: (as for instance, the experiences) 'the pot is real', 'the cloth is real', 'the elephant is real'  (which experiences) are not like (that of) 'a blue lotus'. [in the empirical experience, 'a blue lotus', there are two awarenesses concerned with two entities, viz the substance (lotus) and the ality (blueness). in the case of the experience, 'the pot is real', etc. the awarenesses are not concerned with substratum and alities, but the awareness of pot,of cloth, etc. are superimposed on the awareness of 'reality', like that of 'water' in a mirage.] this is how it happens everywhere. [the coexistence of 'reality' and 'pot' etc. are valid only empirically  according to the non-dualists , whereas the coexistence of 'blueness' and 'lotus' is real according to the dualists.] of these two awareness, the awareness of pot etc. is inconstant , and thus has it been shown above. but the awareness of reality is not (inconstant). therefore the object of the awareness of pot etc. is unreal because of inconstancy , but not so the object of the awareness of reality, because of its constancy. objection: if it be argued that, since the awareness of pot also changes when the pot is destroyed, therefore the awareness of the pot's reality is also changeful? vedantin: no, because in cloth etc. the awareness of reality is seen to persist. that awareness relates to the odjective (and not to the noun 'pot'). for this reason also it is not destroyed. [this last sentence has been cited in the f.n. of a.a.-tr.] objection: if it be argued that like the awareness of reality, the awareness of a pot also persists in other pots? vedantin: no, because that (awareness of pot) is not present in (the awareness of) a cloth etc. objection: may it not be that even the awareness of reality is not present in relation to a pot that has been destroyed? vedantin: no, because the noun is absent (there). since the awareness of reality corresponds to the adjective (i.e. it is used adjectivelly), therefore, when the noun is missing there is no possibility of its (that awareness) being an adjective. so, to what should it relate? but, again, the awareness of reality (does not cease) with the absence of an object৷৷ [even when a pot is absent and the awareness of reality does not arise with regare to it, the awareness of reality persists in the region where the pot had existed.  some read nanu in place of na tu ('but, again'). in that case, the first portion (no,৷৷.since৷৷.adjective. so,৷৷.relate?) is a statement of the vedantin, and the objection starts from nanu punah sadbuddheh, etc. so, the next objection will run thus: 'may it not be said that, when nouns like pot etc. are absent, the awareness of existence has no noun to alify, and therefore it becomes impossible for it (the awareness of existence) to exist in the same substratum?'-tr.] objection: may it not be said that, when nouns like pot etc. are absent, (the awareness of existence has no noun to alify and therefore) it becomes impossible for it to exist in the same substratum? [the relationship of an adjective and a noun is seen between two real entities. therefore, if the relationship between 'pot' and 'reality' be the same as between a noun and an adjective, then both of them will be real entities. so, the coexistence of reality with a non-pot does not stand to reason.] vedantin: no, because in such experiences as, 'this water exists', (which arises on seeing a mirage etc.) it is observed that there is a coexistence of two objects though one of them is non-existent. therefore, asatah, of the unreal, viz body etc. and the dualities (heat, cold, etc.), together with their causes , na vidyate, there is no , bhavah, being. and similarly, satah, of the real, of the self , na vidyate, there is no , abhavah, nonexistence, because it is constant everywhere. this is what we have said. tu, but , antah, the nature, the conclusion (regarding the nature of the real and the unreal) that the real is verily real, and the unreal is verily unreal , ubhayoh api, of both these indeed, of the self and the non-self, of the real and the unreal, as explained above , drstah, has been realized thus , tattva-darsibhih, by the seers of truth. tat is a pronoun (sarvanama, lit. name of all) which can be used with regard to all. and all is brahman. and its name is tat. the abstraction of tat is tattva, the true nature of brahman. those who are apt to realize this are tattva-darsinah, seers of truth. therefore, you too, by adopting the vision of the men of realization and giving up sorrow and delusion, forbear the dualities, heat, cold, etc.  some of which are definite in their nature, and others inconstant , mentally being convinced that this (phenomenal world) is changeful, verily unreal and appears falsely like water in a mirage. this is the idea. what, again, is that reality which remains verily as the real and surely for ever? this is being answered in, 'but know that', etc",

(the lord) now says that the bodies are perishable:",
  "avinasi etc  [here]  tu is in the sense of ca 'and'.  so, 'and' the soul is not of perishing nature",

  "the root 'dih' means 'to grow.' hence these bodies (dehas) are characterised by complexity. they have an end - their nature is perishablity. for, jugs and such other things which are characterised by complexity are seen to have an end. the bodies of the embodied self, which are made of conglomerated elements, serve the purpose of experiencing the effects of karmas, as stated in brh. u. iv. 4.5, 'auspicious embodiments are got through good actions.' such bodies perish when karmas are exhausted. further the self is imperishable. why?  because it is not measurable. neither can it be conceived as the object of knowledge, but only as the subject (knower). it will be taught later on:  'he who knows it is called the knower of the field by those who know this (13.1).  besides, the self is not seen to be made up of many (elements). because in the perception 'i am the knower' throughout the body, only something other than the body is understood as possessing an invariable form as the knower. further, this knower cannot be dismembered and seen in different places as is the case with the body. therefore the self is eternal, for (1) it is not a complex being of a single form , (2) it is the knowing subject , and (3) it pervades all. on the contrary, the body is perishable, because (1) it is complex , (2) it serves the purpose of experiencing the fruits of karma by the embodied self , (3) it has a plurality of parts and (4) it can be pervaded. therefore, as the body is by nature perishable and the self by nature is eternal, both are not objects fit for grief. hence, bearing with courage the inevitable strike of weapons, sharp or hard, liable to be received by you and others, begin the action called war without being attached to the fruits but for the sake of attaining immortality",
  "antavantah etc.  the bodies, at the time of their attaining the unobservable stage,  meet their apparent destruction.  this would be impossible if they do not suffer the peculiar destruction,  that it to say they undergo changes every moment.  for, it has been said-   'by observing the dilapidated condition of beings at their last moment, the loss of newness is very moment is inferred'   the same has been said by the sage (vyasa) also as-   'in every being, in every moment, there is mutual difference between its tiny parts that have different purposes.  but on account of its subtlity, it is not cleary comprehended (mb, santi.,  moksa. ch. 308, verse 121).   [in theabove passage] having different purposes amounts to say 'because they perform different acts having their own respective special purposes. ,    now, the bodies have thier end and are ever changing.  on the other hand, the self is destructionless,  because it is incomprehensible.  changing nature belongs only to the insentient thing which is comprehensible, but not to what is non-insentient and is exclusively consciousness in nature.  because, it is not possible [for one]  to gain an altogether different nature.  thus, the bodies meet permanently their end and hence they cannot be lamented for ,  the self ever remains without destruction (or without changing)  and hence need not be lamented for.  thus a single  krtya-suffix  has been employed on both the senses simultaneously by the sage in the expression asocyan",
  "ime, these , antavantah, destructible , dehah, bodies  as the idea of reality which continues with regard to water in a mirage, etc. gets eliminated when examined with the means of knowledge, and that is its end, so are these bodies and they have an end like bodies etc. in dream and magic  , uktah, are said, by discriminating people , to belong nityasya, to the everlasting , anasinah, the indestructible , aprameyasya, the indeterminable , sarirnah, embodied one, the self. this is the meaning. the two words 'everlasting' and 'indestructible' are not repetitive, because in common usage everlastingness and destructibility are of two kinds. as for instance, a body which is reduced to ashes and has disappeared is said to have been destoryed. (and) even while existing, when it becomes transfigured by being afflicted with diseases etc. it is said to be 'destroyed'. [here the a.a. adds 'tatha dhana-nase-apyevam, similar is the case even with regard to loss of wealth.'-tr.] that being so, by the two words 'everlasting' and 'indestructible' it is meant that it is not subject to both kinds of distruction. otherwise, the everlastingness of the self would be like that of the earth etc. therefore, in order that this contingency may not arise, it is said, 'of the everlasting, indestructible'. aprameyasya, of the indeterminable, means 'of that which cannot be determined by such means of knowledge as direct perception etc.' objection: is it not that the self is determined by the scriptures, and before that through direct perception etc.? vedantin: no, because the self is self-evident. for, (only) when the self stands predetermined as the knower, there is a search for a means of knolwedge by the knower. indeed, it is not that without first determining oneself as, 'i am such', one takes up the task of determining an object of knowledge. for what is called the 'self' does not remain unknown to anyone. but the scripture is the final authority [when the vedic text establishes brahman as the innermost self, all the distinctions such as knower, known and the means of knowledge become sublated. thus it is reasonable that the vedic text should be the final authority. besides, its authority is derived from its being faultless in as much as it has not originated from any human being.]: by way of merely negating superimposition of alities that do not belong to the self, it attains authoritativeness with regard to the self, but not by virtue of making some unknown thing known. there is an upanisadic text in support of this: '৷৷.the brahman that is immediate and direct, the self that is within all' (br. 3.4.1). since the self is thus eternal and unchanging, tasmat, therefore , yudhyasva, you join the battle, i.e. do not desist from the war. here there is no injunction to take up war as a duty, because be (arjuna), though he was determined for war, remains silent as a result of being overpowered by sorrow and delusion. therefore, all that is being done by the lord is the removal of the obstruction to his duty. 'therefore, join the battle' is only an approval, not an injunction. the scripture gita is intended for eradicating sorrow, delusion, etc. which are the cases of the cycle of births and deaths , it is not intended to enjoin action. as evidences of this idea the lord cites two vedic verses: [ka. 1.2.19-20. there are slight verbal differences.-tr.]",
  "he who takes the self to be the slayer and he who thinks it is slain, neither of them ï1knowsï1. it slays not, nor is it slain",
  "he who thinks that the spirit kills, and he who thinks of it as killed, are both ignorant. the spirit kills not, nor is it killed",
  "whosoever views this to be the slayer and whosoever believes  this to be the slain,  both these do not understand :  this does not slay,  nor is this slain",
  "he who deems it (the self) a slayer, and he who thinks of it as slain - both are ignorant. for, the self neither slays nor is slain",
  "he who thinks of this one as the killer, and he who thinks of this one as the killed  both of them do not know. this one does not kill, nor is it killed",
  "with regard to 'this' viz., the self, whose nature has been described above, he who thinks of it as the slayer, i.e., as the cause of slaying, and he who thinks 'this' (self) as slain by some cause or other - both of them do not know. as this self is eternal for the reasons mentioned above, no possible cause of destruction can slay it and for the same reason, it cannot be slain. though the root 'han' (to slay) has the self for its object, it signifies causing the separation of the body from the self and not destruction of the self. scriptural texts like 'you shall not cause injury to beings' and 'the brahmana shall not be killed'?  (k. sm. 8.2) indicate unsanctioned actions, causing separation of the body from the self. [in the above otes, slaughter in an ethical sense is referred to, while the text refers to killing or separating the self from the body in a metaphsyical sense. this is made explicit in the following verse]",

  "in the mantra, 'he who thinks of this one as the killer,' having declared that (the self) does not become the agent or the object of the actof killing, and then in the mantra, 'never is this one born,' etc., having stated the reasons for (its) changelessness, the lord sums up the purport of what was declared above: he who knows this one as indestructible, etc. yah, he who , veda, knows  yah is to be thus connected with veda  , enam, this one, possessing the characteristics stated in the earlier mantra , as avinasinam, indestructible, devoid of the final change of state , nityam, eternal, devoid of transformation , ajam, birthless , and avyayam, undecaying , katham, how, in what way , (and kam, whom ,) does sah, that man of realization , purusah, the person who is himself an authority [i.e. above all injunctions and prohibitions. see 18.16.17.-tr.] , hanti, kill, undertake the act of killing , or how ghatayati, does he cause (others) to be killed, (how does he) instigate a killer! the intention is to deny both (the acts) by saying, 'in no way does he kill any one, nor does he cause anyone to be killed', because an interrogative sense is absurd (here). since the implication of the reason [the reason for the denial of killing etc. is the changelessness of the self, and this reason holds good with regard to all actions of the man of realization.-tr.], viz the immutability of the self, [the a.a. omits 'viz the immutability of the self'.-tr.] is common (with regard to all actions), therefore the negation of all kinds of actions in the case of a man of realization is what the lord conveys as the only purport of this context. but the denial of (the act of) killing has been cited by way of an example. objection: by noticing what special reason for the impossibility of actions in the case of the man of realization does the lord deny all actions (in his case) by saying, 'how can that person,' etc.? vedantin: has not the immutability of the self been already stated as the reason [some readings omit this word.-tr.] , the specific ground for the impossibility of all actions? objection: it is true that it has been stated , but that is not a specific ground, for the man of realization is different from the immutable self. indeed, may it not be argued that action does not become impossible for one who has known as unchanging stump of a tree?! vedantin: no, because of man of knowledge is one with the self. enlightenment does not belong to the aggregate of body and senses. therefore, as the last laternative, the knower is the immutable and is the self which is not a part of the aggregate. thus, action being impossible for that man of knowledge, the denial in, 'how can that person৷৷.,' etc. is reasonable. as on account of the lack of knowledge of the distinction between the self and the modifications of the intellect, the self, though verily immutable, is imagined through ignorance to be the perceiver of objects like sound etc. presented by the intellect etc., in this very way, the self, which in reality is immutable, is said to be the 'knower' because of its association with the knowledge of the distinction between the self and non-self, which (knowledge) is a modification of the intellect [by buddhi-vrtti, modification of the intellect, is meant the transformation of the internal organ into the form of an extension upto an object, along with its past impressions, the senses concerned, etc., like the extension of the light of a lamp illuminating an object. consciousness reflected on this transformation and remaining indistinguishable from that transformation revealing the object, is called objective knowledge. thery, due to ignorance, the self is imagined to be the perceiver because of its connection with the vrtti, modification. (-a.g.) the process is elsewhere described as follows: the vrtti goes out through the sense-organ concerned, like the flash of a torchlight, and along with it goes the reflection of consciousness. both of them envelop the object, a pot for instance. the vrtti destroys the ignorance about the pot , and the reflection of consciousness, becoming unified with only that portion of it which has been delimited by the pot, reveals the pot. in the case of knowledge of brahman, it is admitted that the vrtti in the form, 'i am brahman', does reach brahman and destroys ignorance about brahman, but it is not admitted that brahman is revealed like a 'pot', for brahman is self-effulgent.-tr.] and is unreal by nature. from the statement that action is impossible for man of realization it is understood that the conclusion of the lord is that, actions enjoined by the scriptures are prescribed for the unenlightened. objection: is not elightenment too enjoined for the ignorant? for, the injunction about enlightenment to one who has already achieved realization is useless, like grinding something that has already been ground! this being so, the distinction that rites and duties are enjoined for the unenlightened, and not for the enlightened one, does not stand to reason. vedantin: no. there can reasonable be a distinction between the existence or nonexistence of a thing to be performed. as after the knowledge of the meaning of the injunction for rites like agnihotra etc. their performance becomes bligatory on the unenlightened one who thinks, 'agnihotra etc. has to be performed by collecting various accessories , i am the agent, and this is my duty',  unlike this, nothing remains later on to be performed as a duty after knowing the meaning of the injunction about the nature of the self from such texts as, 'never is this one born,' etc. but apart from the rise of knowledge regarding the unity of the self, his non-agency, etc., in the form, 'i am not the agent, i am not the enjoyer', etc., no other idea arises. thus, this distinction can be maintained. again, for anyone who knows himself as, 'i am the agent', there will necessarily arise the idea, 'this is my duty.' in relation to that he becomes eligible. in this way duties are (enjoined) [ast. adds 'sambhavanti, become possible'.-tr.] for him. and according to the text, 'both of them do not know' (19), he is an unenlightened man. and the text, 'how can that person,' etc. concerns the enlightened person distinguished above, becuase of the negation of action (in this text). therefore, the enlightened person distinguished above, who has realized the immutable self, and the seeker of liberation are alified only for renunciation of all rites and duties. therefore, indeed, the lord narayana, making a distinction between the enlightened man of knowledge and the unenlightened man of rites and duties, makes them take up the two kinds of adherences in the text, 'through the yoga of knowledge for the men of realization , through the yoga of action for the yogis' (3.3). similarly also, vyasa said to his son, 'now, there are these two paths,' etc. ['now, there are these two paths on which the vedas are based. they are thought of as the dharma characterized by engagement in duties, and that by renunciation of them' (mbh. sa. 241.6).-tr.] so also (there is a vedic text meaning): 'the path of rites and duties, indeed, is the earlier, and renunciation comes after that.' [ast. says that this is not a otation, but only gives the purport of tai, ar. 10.62.12.-tr.] the lord will show again and again this very division: 'the unenlightened man who is deluded by egoism thinks thus: 'i am the doer' , but the one who is a knower of the facts (about the varieties of the gunas) thinks, 'i do not act'' (cf. 3.27,28). so also there is the text, '(the embodied man of selfcontrol,) having given up all actions mentally, continues (happily in the town of nine gates)' (5.13) etc. with regard to this some wiseacres say: in no person does arise the idea, 'i am the changeless, actionless self, which is one and devoid of the six kinds of changes beginning with birth to which all things are subject', on the occurrence of which (idea alone) can renunciation of all actions be enjoined. that is not correct, because it will lead to the needlessness of such scriptural instructions as, 'never is this one born,' etc. (20). they should be asked: as on the authority of scripural instructions there arises the knowledge of the existence of virtue and vice and the knowledge regarding an agent who gets associated with successive bodies, similarly, why should not there arise from the scriptures the knowledge of unchangeability, non-agentship, oneness, etc. of that very self? objection: if it be said that this is due to its being beyond the scope of any means (of knowledge)? vedantin: no, because the sruti says, 'it is to be realized through the mind alone, (following the instruction of the teacher)' (br. 4.4.19). the mind that is purified by the instructions of the scriptures and the teacher, control of the body and organs, etc. becomes the instrument for realizing the self. again, since there exist inference and scriptures for its realization, it is mere bravado to say that knowledge does not arise. and it has to be granted that when knowledge arises, it surely eliminates ignorance, its opposite. and that ignorance has been shown in, 'i am the killer', 'i am killed', and 'both of them do not know' (see 2.19). and here also it is shown that the idea of the self being an agent, the object of an action, or an indirect agent, is the result of ignorance. also, the self being changeless, the fact that such agentship etc. are cuased by ignorance is a common factor in all actions without exception, because only that agent who is subject to change instigates someone else who is different from himself and can be acted on, saying, 'do this.' thus, with a view to pointing out the absence of fitness for rites and duties in the case of an enlightened person, the lord [ast, adds vasudeva after 'lord'.-tr.] says, 'he who knows this one as indestructible,' 'how can that person,' etc.  thery denying this direct and indirect agentship of an enlightened person in respect of all actions without exception. as regards the estion, 'for what, again, is the man of enlightenment alified?', the answer has already been give earlier in, 'through the yoga of knowledge for the men of realization' (3.3). similarly, the lord will also speak of renunication of all actions in, 'having given up all actions mentally,' etc.(5.13). objection: may it not be argued that from the expression, 'mentally', (it follows that) oral and bodily actions are not to be renounced? vedantin: no, because of the categoric expression, 'all actions'. objection: may it not be argued that 'all actions' relates only to those of the mind? vedantin: no, because all oral and bodily actions are preceded by those of the mind, for those actions are impossible in the absence of mental activity. objection: may it not be said that one has to mentally renounce all other activities except the mental functions which are the causes of scriptural rites and duties performed through speech and body? vedantin: no, because it has been specifically expressed: 'without doing or causing (others) to do anything at all' (5.13). objection: may it not be that this renunciation of all actions, as stated by the lord, is with regard to a dying man, not one living? vedantin: no, because (in that case) the specific statement, 'the embodied man৷৷.continues happily in the town of nine gates' (ibid.) will become illogical since it is not possible for a dead person, who neither acts nor makes others act, [the words 'akurvatah akarayatah, (of him) who neither acts nor makes others act', have been taken as a part of the commentator's arguement. but a.g. points out that they can also form a part of the next objection. in that, case, the translation of the objection will be this: can it not be that the construction of the sentence (under discussion) is  neither doing nor making others do, he rest by depositing (sannyasya, by renouncing) in the body', but not 'he rests in the body by renouncing৷৷.'?] to rest in that body after renouncing all actions.   objection: can it not be that the construction of the sentence (under discussion) is, '(he rests) by depositing (sannyasya, by renouncing) in the body', (but) not 'he rests in the body by renouncing৷৷.'? vedantin: no, because everywhere it is categorically asserted that the self is changeless. besides, the action of 'resting' reires a location, whereas renunciation is independent of this. the word nyasa preceded by sam here means 'renunciation', not 'depositing'. therefore, according to this scripture, viz the gita, the man of realization is eligible for renunciation, alone, not for rites and duties. this we shall show in the relevant texts later on in the cotext of the knowledge of the self. and now we shall speak of the matter on hand: as to that, the indestructibility [indestructibility suggests unchangeability as well.] of the self, has been postulated. what is it like? that is being said in, 'as after rejecting wornout clothes,' etc",
  "just as a man casts off worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so also the embodied self casts off worn-out bodies and enters others which are new",
  "as a man discards his threadbare robes and puts on new, so the spirit throws off its worn-out bodies and takes fresh ones",
  "just as rejecting the tattered garments, a man takes other new ones,  in the same way,  rejecting the decayed bodies,  the embodied (self) rightly proceeds to other new ones",
  "as a man casts off worn-out garments and puts on others that are new, so does the embodied self cast off its worn-out bodies and enter into others that are new",
  "as after rejecting wornout clothes a man takes up other new ones, likewise after rejecting wornout bodies the embodied one unites with other new ones",
  "that those who give up their bodies in a righteous war get more beauteous bodies than before, is known through the scriptures. casting off worn-out garments and taking new and beautiful ones, can be only a cause of joy, as seen here in the world in the case of new garments.  once again sri krsna emphasises for easy understanding the indestructibility of the self, taught before:  'know that to be indestructible by which all this is pervaded' (ii.17) and confirms it thus:",

[it may be argued that the self is the object of egoism. the answer is: although the individualized self is the object of egoism, the absolute self is not.] this is being answered in, 'someone visualizes it as a wonder,' etc. kascit, someone , pasyati, visualizes , enam, it, the self , ascaryavat, as a wonder, as though it were a wonder  a wonder is something not seen before, something strange, something seen all on a sudden , what is comparable to that is ascarya-vat , ca, and , tatha, similarly , eva, indeed , kascit, someone , anyah, else , vadati, talks of it as a wonder. and someone else srnoti, hears of it as a wonder. and someone, indeed, na, does not , veda, realize it , api, even , srutva, after hearing, seeing and speaking about it. or, (the meaning is) he who sees the self is like a wonder. he who speaks of it and the who hears of it is indeed rare among many thousands. therefore, the idea is that the self is difficult to understand. now, in the course of concluding the topic under discussion, [viz the needlessness of sorrow and delusion,from the point of view of the nature of things.] he says, 'o descendant of bharata, this embodied self', etc",

  "o descendant of bharata, this embodied self existing in everyone's body can never be killed. therefore you ought not to grieve for all (these) beings",
  "the self within the body of everyone such as gods etc., must be considered to be eternally imperishable, though the body can be killed. therefore, all beings from gods to immovable beings, even though they possess different forms, are all uniform and eternal in their nature as described above. the ineality and the perishableness pertain only to the bodies. therefore, it is not fit for you to feel grief for any of the beings beginning from gods etc., and not merely for bhisma and such others",

  "further, having regard to thy duty, shouldst not waver, for there is nothing higher for a kshatriya than a righteous war",
  "thou must look at thy duty. nothing can be more welcome to a soldier than a righteous war. therefore to waver in this resolve is unworthy, o arjuna!",

  "further, considering also your own duty, it does not befit you to waver. for, to a ksatriya, there is no greater good than a righteous war",
  "even considering your own duty you should not waver, since there is nothing else better for a ksatriya than a righteous battle",
  "further, even though there is killing of life in this war which has begun, it is not fit for you to waver, considering your own duty, as in the agnisomiya and other sacrifices involving slaughter. to a ksatriya, there is no greater good than a righteous war, begun for a just cause. it will be declared in the gita:  'valour, non-defeat (by the enemies), fortitude, adroitness and also not fleeing from battle, generosity, lordliness - these are the duties of the ksatriya born of his very nature.' (18.43).  in agnisomiya etc., no injury is caused to the animal to be immolated , for, according to the vedic text, the victim, a he-goat, after abandoning an inferior body, will attain heaven etc., with a beautiful body. the text pertaining to immolation declares:  'o animal, by this (immolation) you will never die, you are not destroyed. you will pass through happy paths to the realm of the gods, where the virtuous only reach and not the sinful. may the god savitr give you a proper place.' (yaj. 4.6.9.46). likewise the attainment of more beautiful bodies by those who die here in this war has been declared in the gita, 'as a man casts off worn-out garments and takes others that are new ৷৷.' (2.22). hence, just as lancing and such other operations of a surgeon are for curing a patient, the immolation of the sacrificial animal in the agnisomiya etc., is only for its good",

  "why, again, does that battle become a duty? this is being answered (as follows) [a specific rule is more authoritative than a general rule. non-violence is a general rule enjoined by the scriptures, but the duty of fighting is a specific rule for a ksatriya.]: partha, o son of partha , are not those ksatiryas sukhinah, happy [happy in this world as also in the other.] who labhante, come across , a yuddham, battle , idrsam, of this kind , upapannam, which presents itself , yadrcchaya, unsought for , and which is an apavrtam, open , svarga-dvaram, gate to heaven?

[the context here is that of the philosophy of the supreme reality. if fighting is enjoined in that context, it will amount to accepting combination of knowledge and actions. to avoid this contingency the commentator says, 'incidental'. that is to say, although the context is of the supreme reality, the advice to fight is incidental. it is not an injunction to combine knowledge with actions, since fighting is here the natural duty of arjuna as a ksatriya.]. the generally accepted argument for the removal of sorrow and delusion has been stated in the verses beginning with, 'even considering your own duty' (31), etc., but this has not been presented by accepting that as the real intention (of the lord). the real context here (in 2.12 etc.), however, is of the realization of the supreme reality. now, in order to show the distinction between the (two) topics dealt with in this scripture, the lord concludes that topic which has been presented above (in 2.20 etc.), by saying, 'this (wisdom) has been imparted,' etc. for, if the distinction between the topics of the scripute be shown here, then the instruction relating to the two kinds of adherences   as stated later on in, 'through the yoga of knowledge for the men of realization , through the yoga of action for the yogis' (3.3)  will proceed again smoothly, and the hearer also will easily comprehend it by keeping in view the distinction between the topics. hence the lord says:",

  "'sankhya' means 'intellect,' and the truth about the atman, which is determinable by the intellect, is 'sankhyam'. concerning the nature of the self which has to be known, whatever buddhi has to be taught, has been taught to you in the passage beginning with, 'it is not that i did not exist' (ii.12) and ending with the words, 'therefore, you shall not grieve for any being' (ii.30). the disposition of mind (buddhi) which is reired for the performance of works preceded by knowledge of the self and which thus constitutes the means of attaining release, that is here called by the term yoga. it will be clearly told later on, 'work done with desire for fruits is far inferior to work done with evennes of mind' (ii. 49). what buddhi or attitude of mind is reired for making your act deserve the name of yoga, listen to it now. endowed with that knowledge, you will be able to cast away the bondage of karma. 'karma-bandha' means the bondage due to karma i.e., the bondage of samsara.  now sri krsna explains the glory of works associated with the buddhi to be described hereafter:",
  "esa te etc.  and this knowledge in th form of determination has been declared [to you] for your sankhya, i.e., perfect  knowledge.  now, how the self-same determinate knowledge is also taught for the yoga  i.e., dexerity in action -  in that manner only you must listen to by means of which determinate knowledge you shall avoid the binding nature of the actions.  truely, the actions do not themselves bind as they are insentient.  hence, it is the self which binds itself by means of the actions in the form of mental impressions",

  " arjuna said  again arjuna, being moved by love, compassion and fear, mistaking unrighteousness for righteousness, and not understanding, i.e., not knowing the beneficial words of sri krsna, said as follows:  'how can i slay bhisma, drona and others worthy or reverence?  after slaying those elders, though they are intensely attached to enjoyments, how can i enjoy those very pleasures which are now being enjoyed by them?  for, it will be mixed with  their blood",
  "in this there is no loss of effort, nor is there any harm (production of contrary results or transgression). even a little of this knowledge (even a little practice of this yoga) protects one from great fear",
  "on this path, endeavour is never wasted, nor can it ever be repressed. even a very little of its practice protects one from great danger",
  "here there is no loss due to transgression,  and there exists no  contrary downward course (sin) ,  even a little of this righteous thing saves [one] from great danger",
  "here, there is no loss of effort, nor any accrual of evil. even a little of this dharma (called karma yoga) protects a man from the great fear",
  "here there is no waste of an attempt , nor is there (any) harm. even a little of this righteousness saves (one) from great fear",
  "here, in karma yoga, there is no loss of 'abhikrama' or of effort that has been put in , 'loss' means the loss of efficacy to bring about the fruits. in karma yoga if work is begun and left unfinished, and the continuity is broken in the middle, it does not remain fruitless, as in the case of works undertaken for their fruits. no evil result is acired if the continuity of work is broken. even a little of this dharma known as karma yoga or niskama karma (unselfish action without desire for any reward) gives protection from the great fear, i.e., the fear of transmigratory existence.  the same purport is explained later thus:  'neither in this world nor the next, o arjuna, there is annihilation for him' (6.40). but in works, vedic and secular, when there is interruption in the middle, not only do they not yield fruits, but also there is accrual of evil.  now, sri krsna distinguishes the buddhi or mental disposition concerned with those acts which constitute a means for attaining release from those which are concerned with the acts meant for gaining the desired objects:",
  "neha etc.  here in this determinate knowledge there arises no loss through transgression, an offence due to negligence , because negligence is [itself] absent there.  and just as a burning oil in the boiler get cooled soon, due to a limited antity of sandal (put in it), in the same way due to this knowledge of yoga-eventhough it is very little-the great danger in the form of the cycle of birth-and-death perishes completely.\t  and this knowledge is not introduced as a new thing.  then what ?",
  "moreover, iha, here, in the path to liberation, viz the yoga of action (rites and duties) , na, there is no , abhikrama-nasah, waste of an attempt, of a beginning, unlike as in agriculture etc. the meaning is that the result of any attempt in the case of yoga is not uncertain. besides, unlike as in medical care, na vidyate, nor is there, nor does there arises , any pratyavayah, harm. but, svalpam api, even a little , asya, of this , dharmasya, righteousness in the form of yoga (of action) , when pracised, trayate, saves (one) , mahato bhayat, from great fear, of mundance existence characterized by death, birth, etc",

  "o source of joy to the kurus !   the knowledge in the form of determination is just one ,  [but] the knowledge (thoughts) of those who do not have determination, has many branches and has no end",
  "in this (karma yoga), o arjuna, the resolute mind is one-pointed , the minds of the irresolute are many-branched and endless",
  "o scion of the kuru dynasty, in this there is a single, one-pointed conviction. the thoughts of the irresolute ones have many branches indeed, and are innumerable",
  "here, i.e., in every ritual sanctioned by the scriptures, the buddhi or disposition of mind marked by resolution, is single. the buddhi marked by resolution is the buddhi concerned with acts which must be performed by one desirous of release (and not any kind of work). the term 'vyavasaya' menas unshakable conviction:  this buddhi (disposition of mind) comes out of prior determination about the true nature of the self. but the buddhi concerning the performance of rituals of fulfill certain desires, is marked by irresolution , because here only this much knowledge of the self is sufficient - 'the self (as an entity) exists differently from the body.' such a general understanding is sufficient to alify for performing acts giving fulfilment of certain desires. it does not reire any definite knowledge about the true nature of the self. for, even if there is no such knowledge, desires for heaven etc., can arise, the means for their attainment can be adopted, and the experience of those fruits can take place. for this reason there is no contradiction in the teaching of the scriptures. [the contradiction negated here is how can the same scriptural acts produce different results - fulfilment of desires and liberation. the difference in the disposition of the mind accouts of it.]  the buddhi (mental disposition) marked by resolution has a single aim, because it relates to the attainment of a single fruit. for, as far as one desiring release is concerned, all acts are enjoined only for the accomplishment of that single fruit. therefore, since the purpose of the scriptures here is one only (i.e., liberation), the buddhi regarding all rituals taught in the scriptures too is only one, as far as liberation-seekers are concerned. for example, the set of six sacrifices, beginning with agneya with all their subsidiary processes (though enjoined in different passages) forms the subject of a single injunction, as they are all for the attainment of a single fruit. conseently the buddhi concerning these is one only. the meaning of the verse under discussion must be construed in the same manner. but the buddhi of the irresolute ones who are engaged in rituals for winning such fruits as heaven, sons, cattle, food etc., are endless, frutis being endless. in rituals like darsapurnamasa (new moon and full moon sacrifice), even though attainment of a single fruit (heaven) is enjoined, there accrues to these the character of having many branches on account of the mention of many secondary fruits as evidenced by such passages as, 'he desires a long life.' therefore the buddhi of irresolute ones has many branches and are endless.  the purport is:  in performing obligatory and occasional rituals, all fruits, primary and secondary, promised in the scriptures, should be abandoned, with the idea that release or salvation is the only purpose of all scripture-ordained rituals. these rituals should be performed without any thought of selfish gains. in addition, acts motivated by desires (kamya-karmas) also should be performed according to one's own capacity, after abandoning all desire for fruits and with the conviction that they also, when performed in that way, form the means for attainment of release. they should be looked upon as eal to obligatory and occasional rites suited to one's own station and stage in life.  sri krsna condemns those who perform acts for the attainment of objects of desire:",

  "the word traigunya means the three gunas - sattva, rajas and tamas. here the term traigunya denotes persons in whom sattva, rajas and tamas are in abundance. the vedas in prescribing desire-oriented rituals (kamya-karmas) have such persons in view. because of their great love, the vedas teach what is good to those in whom tamas, rajas and sattva preponderate. if the vedas had not explained to these persons the means for the attainment of heaven etc., according to the gunas, then those persons who are not interested in liberation owing to absence of sattva and preponderance of rajas and tamas in them, would get completely lost amidst what should not be resorted to, without knowing the means for attaining the results they desire. hence the vedas are concerned with the gunas. be you free from the three gunas. try to acire sattva in abundance , increase that alone. the purport is:  do not nurse the preponderance of the three gunas in their state of inter-mixture , do not cultivate such preponderance.  be free from the pairs of opposites , be free from all the characteristics of worldly life. abide in pure sattva , be established in sattva, in its state of purity without the admixture of the other two gunas. if it is estioned how that is possible, the reply is as follows. never care to acire things nor protect what has been acired. while abandoning the acisition of what is not reired for self-realisation, abandon also the conservation of such things already acired. you can thus be established in self-control and thery become an aspirant after the essentail nature of the self. 'yoga' is acisition of what has not been acired , 'ksema' is preservation of things already acired. abandoning these is a must for an aspirant after the essential nature of the self. if you conduct yourself in this way, the preponderance of rajas and tamas will be annihilated, and pure sattva will develop.  besides, all that is taught in the vedas is not fit to be utilised by all",
  "traigunya-etc.  the vedas bind  very much [only] by means of the three strands and they do not bind on their own accord.  for, the rituals prescribed in the vedas, create bondage if they are performed with an intention of pleasure, or of (avoiding) pain, or with an illlusion of attachment.  hence the traid of strands in the form of desire (or in a pleasing form) must be abandoned.   if the present passage were intended to condemn the vedas, then the act of fighting the battle in estion would be spoiled, because there is nothing other than the vedas do not bind those, from whom the desire for fruit has completely gone.\t  because the vedas alone are useful for proper knowledge in the case of those persons [free from the strands] hence [the lord] says-",

[there is a seeming conflict between the advices to be free from the three alities and to be ever-poised in the ality of sattva. hence, the commentator takes the phrase nistraigunya to mean niskama, free from desires.] (be) nirdvandvah, free from the pairs of duality  by the word dvandva, duality, are meant the conflicting pairs [of heat and cold, etc.] which are the causes of happiness and sorrow , you become free from them. [from heat, cold, etc. that is, forbear them.] you become nitya-sattvasthah, ever-poised in the ality of sattva , (and) so also niryoga-ksemah, without (desire for) acisition and protection. yoga means acisition of what one has not, and ksema means the protection of what one has. for one who as 'acisition and protection' foremost in his mind, it is difficult to seek liberation. hence, you be free from acisition and protection. and also be atmavan, self-collected, vigilant. this is the advice given to you while you are engaged in your own duty.

  "if action is not to be undertaken by one who is under the impulsion of the fruits of action, how then are they to be undertaken? this is being stated: yogasthah, by becoming established in yoga , o dhanajaya, kuru, undertake , karmani, actions, for the sake of god alone , even there, tyaktva, casting off , sangam, attachment, in the form, 'god will be pleased with me.' ['undertake work for pleasing god, but not for propitiating him to become favourable towards yourself.'] undertake actions bhutva, remaining , samah, eipoised , siddhi-asidhyoh, in success and failure  even in the success characterized by the attainment of knowledge that arises from the purification of the mind when one performs actions without hankering for the results, and in the failure that arises from its opposite. [ignorance, arising from the impurity of the mind.] what is that yoga with regard to being established in which it is said, 'undertake'? this indeed is that: the samatvam, eanimity in success and failure , ucyate, is called , yogah, yoga",
  "far lower than the yoga of wisdon is action, o arjuna. seek thou refuge in wisdom , wretched are they whose motive is the fruit",
  "physical action is far inferior to an intellect concentrated on the divine. have recourse then to pure intelligence. it is only the petty-minded who work for reward",
  "o dhananjaya !  the inferior action stays away at a distance due to yoga of (one's contact with)  determining faculty ,  in the determining faculty you must seek refuge , wretched are those who constitute the causes for the fruits of action",
  "action with attachment is far inferior, o arjuna, to action done with evenness of mind. seek refuge in evenness of mind. miserable are they who act with a motive for results",
  "o dhananjaya, indeed, action is ite inferior to the yoga of wisdom. take resort to wisdom. those who thirst for rewards are pitiable",
  "all other kinds of action are far inferior to those done with evenness of mind, which consists in the renunciation of the main result and with eanimity towards success or failure in  respect of the secondary results. between the two kinds of actions, the one with eanimity and the other with attachment, the former associated with eanimity removes all the sufferings of samsara and leads to release which is the highest object of human existence. the latter type of actions, which is pursued with an eye on results, leads one to samsara whose character is endless suffering. thus when an act is being done, take refuge in buddhi (evenness of mind). refuge means abode. live in that buddhi, is the meaning. 'miserable are they who act with a motive for results':  it means, 'those who act with attachment to the results, etc., are miserable, as they will continue in samsara.'",
  "durena etc. due to the contact  (one has) with determining faculty  [one's]  inferior action i.e.,  the action that bears bad fruits and is empty, remains far away [from him].  therefore seek i.e., pray for a refuge in the determining faculty of that nature, on account of which that determining faculty is gained",
  "then again, o dhananjaya, as against action performed with eanimity of mind for adoring god, karma, action undertaken by one longing for the results , is, hi, indeed , durena, ite, by far , avaram, inferior, very remote , buddhi-yogat, from the yoga of wisdom, from actions undertaken with eanimity of mind, because it (the former) is the cause of birth, death, etc. since this is so, therefore, saranam anviccha, take resort to, seek shelter , buddhau, under wisdom, which relates to yoga, or to the conviction about reality that arises from its (the former's) maturity and which is the cause of (achieving) fearlessness. the meaning is that you should resort to the knowledge of the supreme goal, because those who under take inferior actions, phala-hetavah, who thirst for rewards, who are impelled by results , are krpanah, pitiable, according to the sruti, 'he, o gargi, who departs from this world without knowing this immutable, is pitiable' (br. 3.8.10). [see note under 2.7.-tr.]",
  "better it is, indeed, in this world to accept alms than to slay the most noble teachers. but if i kill them, even in this world all my enjoyments of wealth and fulfilled desires will be stained with (their) blood",
  "rather would i content myself with a beggar's crust that kill these teachers of mine, these precious noble souls! to slay these masters who are my benefactors would be to stain the sweetness of life's pleasures with their blood",
  "it is good indeed even to go about begging in this world without killing the elders of great dignity ,  but with greed for wealth,  i would not enjoy,  by killing my elders,  the blood-stained objects of pleasures",
  "it is better even to live on a beggar's fare in this world than to slay these most venerable teachers. if i should slay my teachers, though degraded they be by desire for wealth, i would be enjoying only blood-stained pleasures here",
  "rather than killing the noble-minded elders, it is better in this world to live even on alms. but by killing the elders we shall only be enjoying here the pleasures of wealth and desireable things drenched in blood",
  " arjuna said  again arjuna, being moved by love, compassion and fear, mistaking unrighteousness for righteousness, and not understanding, i.e., not knowing the beneficial words of sri krsna, said as follows:  'how can i slay bhisma, drona and others worthy or reverence?  after slaying those elders, though they are intensely attached to enjoyments, how can i enjoy those very pleasures which are now being enjoyed by them?  for, it will be mixed with  their blood",
  "endowed with wisdom (evenness of mind), one casts off in this life both good and evil deeds , therefore, devote thyself to yoga , yoga is skill in action",
  "when a man attains to pure reason, he renounces in this world the results of good and evil alike. cling thou to right action. spirituality is the real art of living",
  "whosoever is endowed with determining faculty-he casts off both of these viz., the good action and the bad action.  therefore strive for yoga , yoga is proficiency is action",
  "a man with evenness of mind discards here and now good and evil. therefore endeavour for yoga. yoga is skill in action",
  "possessed of wisdom, one rejects here both virtue and vice. therefore devote yourself to (karma-) yoga. yoga is skilfulness in action",
  "he, who is established in evenness of mind in the performance of actions, relinishes good and evil karmas which have accumulated from time immemorial causing bondage endlessly. therefore acire this aforesaid evenness of mind (buddhi yoga). yoga is skill in action. that is, this evenness of mind when one is engaged in action, is possible through great skill, i.e., ability",
  "buddhiyuktah etc.  both indicates the mutual exclusion  [of the good and bad actions].  therefore [strive] for yoga etc. : working in that manner alone constitutes the supreme proficiency, by [working] in which manner the good action and the bad action perish.  this is the idea here",
  "listen to the result that one possessed of the wisdom of eanimity attains by performing one's own duties: buddhi-yuktah, possessed of wisdom, possessed of the wisdom of eanimity , since one jahati, rejects , iha, here, in this world , ubhe, both , sukrta-duskrte, virtue and vice (righteousness and unrighteousness), through the purification of the mind and acisition of knowledge , tasmat, therefore , yujyasva, devote yourself , yogaya, to (karma-) yoga, the wisdom of eanimity. for yoga is kausalam, skilfulness , karmasu, in action. skilfulness means the attitude of the skilful, the wisdom of eanimity with regard to one's success and failure while engaged in actions (karma)  called one's own duties (sva-dharma)  with the mind dedicated to god. that indeed is skilfulness which, through eanimity, makes actions that by their very nature bind give up their nature! therefore, be you devoted to the wisdom of eanimity",
  "the wise, possessed of knowledge, having abandoned the fruits of their actions, and being freed from the fetters of birth, go to the place which is beyond all evil",
  "the sages guided by pure intellect renounce the fruit of action , and, freed from the chains of rebirth, they reach the highest bliss",
  "by renouncing the fruit, born of action, the intelligent ones endowed with determining faculty and freed from the bond of birth,  go to the place that is devoid of illness",
  "the wise who possess evenness of mind, relinishing the fruits born of action, are freed from the bondage of birth, and go to the region beyond all ills",
  "because, those who are devoted to wisdom, (they) becoming men of enlightenment by giving up the fruits produced by actions, reach the state beyond evils by having become freed from the bondage of birth",
  "those who possess this evenness of mind while performing actions and relinish their fruits, are freed from the bondage of rirth, and go to the region beyond all ills. 'hi' means that this dictum or teaching is well known in all the upanisads",
  "karmajam etc.  the persons who are endowed with the determining faculty with regard to the yoga,  renounce the birth-bondage, by renouncing the fruit of actions , and they attain the brahman-existence",
  "the words 'phalam tyaktva, by giving up the fruits' are connected with the remote word 'karmajam, produced by actions'. hi, because , [because, when actions are performed with an attitude of eanimity, it leads to becoming freed from sin etc. therefore, by stages, it becomes the cause of liberation as well.] buddhi-yuktah, those who are devoted to wisdom, who are imbued with the wisdom of eanimity , (they) becoming manisinah, men of enlightenment , tyaktva, by giving up , phalam, the fruit, the acisition of desirable and undesriable bodies , [desirable: the bodies of gods and others , undesirable: the bodies of animals etc.] karmajam, produced by actions , gacchanti, reach , padam, the state, the supreme state of visnu, called liberation , anamayam, beyond evils, i.e. beyond all evils , by having become janma-bandha-vinirmuktah, freed from the bondage of birth  birth (janma) itself is a bondage (bandha) , becoming freed from that , even while living. or:  since it (buddhi) has been mentioned as the direct cause of the elimination of righteousness and unrighteousness, and so on, therefore what has been presented (in the three verses) beginning with, 'o dhananjaya,৷৷.to the yoga of wisdom' (49), is enlightenment itself, which consists in the realization of the supreme goal, which is comparable to a flood all around, and which arises from the purification of the mind as a result of karma-yoga. [in the first portion of the commentary buddhi has been taken to mean samattva buddhi (wisdom of eanimity) , the alternative meaning of buddhi has been taken as 'enlightenment'. so, action is to be performed by taking the help of the 'wisdom about the supreme reality' which has been chosen as one's goal.]",
  "when thy intellect crosses beyond the mire of delusion, then thou shalt attain to indifference as to what has been heard and what has yet to be heard",
  "when thy reason has crossed the entanglements of illusion, then shalt thou become indifferent both to the philosophies thou hast heard and to those thou mayest yet hear",

  "when your mind will go beyond the turbidity of delusion, then you will acire dispassion for what has to be heard and what has been heard",
  "if you act in this manner and get freed from impurities, your intellect will pass beyond the tangle of delusion. the dense impurity of sin is the nature of that delusion which generates attachment to infinitesimal results, of which you have already heard much from us and will hear more later on. you will then immediately feel, of your own accord, renunciation or feeling of disgust for them all.  sri krsna now teaches the goal called self-realisation (yoga) which results from the performance of duty as taught in the passage beginning with 'now, listen to this with regard to karma yoga' (2.39) which is based on the knowledge of the real nature of the self gained through the refinement of the mind",

  "when your determining faculty,  that had been [earlier] confused by your hearing [of scriptural declaration of fruits]  shall stand stable in concentration, at that time you shall attain the yoga",
  "when your intellect, well enlightened by hearing from me and firmly placed, stands unshaken in a concentrated mind, then you will attain the vision of the self",
  "when your mind that has become bewildered by hearing [s. takes the word sruti in the sense of the vedas.-tr.] will become unshakable and steadfast in the self, then you will attain yoga that arises from discrimination",
  "here 'sruti' means hearing (and not the veda). when your intellect, which, by hearing from us, has become specially enlightened, having for its object the eternal, unsurpassed and subtle self - which belongs to a class different from all other entities -, then the intellect is firmly fixed, i.e., in a single psychosis and stands unshaken. in such a concentrated mind, purified by the performance of duties without attachment, will be generated true yoga, which consists in the vision of the self. what is said is this:  karma yoga, which presupposes the knowledge of the real nature of the self obtained from the scriptures, leads to a firm devotion to knowledge known as the state of firm wisdom , and the state of 'firm wisdom ,' which is in the form of devotion to knowledge, generates the vision of the self , this vision is here called yoga.  arjuna, thus taught, estions about the nature of 'firm wisdom' which constitutes the means for the attainment of yoga and which itself is attainable through karma yoga which consists in work with detachment, and also about the mode of behaviour of a man of 'firm wisdom.'",

[for, it has no such force in it].  yet, the present estion is to make the etymological meaning-though it is already available-clear by explaining the basis for definition of special nature.   the expression sthira-dhih has for its imports both the expression [itself] and its meaning  'the fixed-minded'.  of  them, does the expression sthira-dhih denote that meaning alone which is indicated by the force of its components , or else does it denote the ascetic also ?  this is the second estion.   again, where would that firm-minded man-of-yoga abide i.e., what would he practise , or what would his firmness depend on ?  this is the third [estion].   and what world he achieve by practising ?  this is the fourth  [estion].   these four estions are decided one by one by the bhagavat [in the seel]",

  "the objects of the senses turn away from the abstinent man leaving the longing (behind) , but his longing also turns away on seeing the supreme",
  "the objects of sense turn from him who is abstemious. even the relish for them is lost in him who has seen the truth",
  "leaving their taste [behind],  the sense-objects retreat from the embodied who abstain from food ,  his taste too disappears when he sees the supreme",
  "the objects of senses, excepting relish for the objects, turn away from the abstinent dweller in the body. even the relish turns aswy from him when what is supreme over the senses i.e., the self, is seen",
  "the objects recede from an abstinent man, with the exception of the taste (for them). even the taste of this person falls away after realization the absolute",
  "the sense objects are the food of the senses. from the abstinent embodied being, i.e., from one who has withdrawn his senses from objects, these sense-objects, being rejected by him, turn away, but not the relish for them. relish means hankering. the meaning is that the hankering for the sense-objects does not go away by abstinence alone. but even this hankering will go away, when one sees that the essential nature of the self is superior to the sense-objects and that the realisation of this self gives greater happiness than the enjoyment of sense-objects",
  "visayah etc.  of course, in his (ascetic's) case there is no contact with sense-objects, colour and the rest that are enjoyable.  yet, the sense-obects  retreat [from him] leaving a taste in the form of longing  that exists in his internal organ.  hence he is not a man-of-stabilized-intellect.  some (commentators)  say that 'taste'  denotes the sweetness etc., of  the objects of experience.  but, in the case of a man of yoga there exists no longing as he has seen the supreme lord.  on the other hand, in the case of the other, i.e. an ascetic, this does not retreat (disappear)",
  "although visayah, the objects, (i.e.) the organs, figuratively implied and expressed by the word 'objects', or, the objects themselves , vinivartante, recede , niraharasya dehinah, from an abstinent man, from an embodied being, even from a fool who engages in painful austerity and abstains from objects , (still, they do so) rasavarjam, with the exception of the taste (for them), with the exception of the hankering that one has for objects. the word rasa is well known as referring to the sense of taste (hankering), as in such expressions as, 'sva-rasena pravrttah, induced by his own taste (i.e. willingly)', 'rasikah, a man of tastes', 'rasajnah, a connoisseur (of tastes)', etc. api, even that , rasah, taste of the nature of subtle attachment , asya, of this person, of the sannyasin , nivartate, falls away, i.e. his objective perception becomes seedless , when drstva, after attaining , param, the absolute, the reality which is the supreme goal, brahman, he continues in life with the realization, 'i verily am that (brahman).' in the absence of full realization there can be no eradication of the 'hankering'. the idea conveyed is that, one should therefore stabilize one's wisdom which is characterized by full realization. [if it be held that attachment cannot be eliminated without the knowledge of brahman, and at the same time that the knowledge of brahman cannot arise until attachment is eradicated, then we get involved in a vicious circle. in answer it is said that gross attachments are eliminated through discrimination which restrains the senses from being overpowered by objects. and the full knowledge arising thereof eliminates the subtle inclinations as well. hence there is no vicious circle involved.] since the organs have to be first brought under his own control by one who desires to establish firmly the wisdom which is characterized by full realization, therefore the lord speaks of the evil that arises from not keeping them under control:",
  "i can hardly tell which will be better, that we should  coner them or that they should coner us. even the sons of dhritarashtra, after slaying whom we do not wish to live, stand facing us",

  "whether we should coner [in the battle],  or they  should coner us-we do not know this viz.,  'which [of  those two] is better for us'.  [for],  having killed whom, we would not wish to live at all,  the same persons stand before us as dhrtarastra's men",
  "we do not know, which of the two is better for us - whether our vanishing them, or their vanishing us. the very sons of dhrtarastra, whom, if we slay, we should not wish to live, even they are standing in array against us",
  "we do not know this as well as to which is the better for us, (and) whether we shall win, or whether they shall coner us. those very sons of dhrtarastra, by killing whom we do not wish to live, stand in confrontation",
  " if you say, 'after beginning the war, if we withdraw from the battle, the sons of dhrtarastra will slay us all forcibly', be it so. i think that even to be killed by them, who do not know the difference between righteousness and unrighteousness, is better for us than gaining unrighteous victory by killing them. after saying so, arjuna surrendered himself at the feet of the lord, overcome with dejection, saying. 'teach me, your disciple, who has taken refuge in you, what is good for me.'",
  "  katham  etc. upto  dhartarastrah.   by the portion bhisma and drona in war' etc., and by the portion  'i would [not] enjoy the objects of  pleasure', the sage indicates that in arjuna's objection, the intention for a particular act and the intention for a particular result are the points deserving rejection.  by the portion  'we do not know this' etc., he speaks of  the intention for a particular action.   for, without intention no action is possible.  certainly one does not proceed on a war with an intention of getting defeated.  '[in the present war]  even our victory would be surely our misfortune.'  this he says by the portion  'it is good even to go about begging without killing the elders'.  it is also impossible to conclude  'whether we desire victory or defeat' ,  for even in the case of our victory our relatives would perish totally.'",
  "the turbulent senses, o arjuna, do violently carry away the mind of a wise man though he be striving (to control them)",
  "o arjuna! the mind of him, who is trying to conquer it, is forcibly carried away in spite of his efforts, by his tumultuous senses",

  "the turbulent senses, o arjuna, do carry away perforce the mind of even a wise man, though he is ever striving",
  "for, o son of kunti, the turbulent organs violently snatch away the mind of an intelligent person, even while he is striving diligently",
  "except by the experience of the self, the hankering for objects will not go away. when the hankering for the sense-objects does not go away, the senses of even a wise man, though he is ever striving to subdue them, become refractory, i.e., become violent and carry away perforce the mind. thus, the subduing of the senses depends on the vision of the self, and the vision of the self depends on the subduing of the senses. conseently, i.e., because of this mutual dependence, firm devotion to knowledge is difficult to achieve",
  "yattasyapi etc.  for, the mind of that ascetic too is carried away by the sense-organs.  or, the expression yattasya api denotes  'even of one who exerts'.  [so], it is but the mind that is to be subdued by a man of yoga.  thus the second [estion] is decided",

[the commentator says that api may be construed either with yatatah or with vipascitah purusasya.-tr.] indeed, the organs confound a person who is inclined towards objects, and after confounding him, violently carry away his mind endowed with discriminating knoweldge, even when he is aware of this. since this is so, therefore,",
  "having restrained them all he should sit steadfast, intent on me , his wisdom is steady whose senses are under control",
  "restraining them all, let him meditate steadfastly on me , for who thus conquers his senses achieves perfection",
  "restraining them (the same-organs) by mind, the master of yoga would sit making me his goal , for, the intellect of that person is stabilized whose sense-organs are under control",
  "having controlled all the senses, let him remain in contemplation, regarding me as supreme , for, his knowledge is firmly set whose senses are under control",
  "controlling all of them, one should remain concentrated on me as the supreme. for, the wisdom of one whose organs are under control becomes steadfast",
  "with a desire to overcome this mutual dependence between the subduing of the senses and vision of the self, one has to coner the senses which are difficult to subdue on account of their attachment to sense-objects. so, focussing the mind on me who am the only auspicious object for meditation, let him remain steadfast. when the mind is focussed on me  as its object, then such a mind, purified by the burning away of all impurities and devoid of attachment to the senses, is able to control the senses. then the mind with the senses under control will be able to experience the self. as said in visnu purana, 'as the leaping fire fanned by the wind burns away a forest of dry trees, so visnu, who is in the hearts of all the yogins, destroys all the sins.' sri krsna teaches the same here:  'he whose senses are under control, his knowledge is firmly set.'  sri krsna says:  'one who endeavours to subdue the senses, depending on one's own exertions, and does not focus the mind on me in this way, becomes lost.'",

'from such desire arises anger.' when a desire exists without its object being nearby, anger arises against persons nearby under the following. 'our desire is thwarted by these persons.'  'from anger there comes delusion'. delusion is want of discrimination between what ought to be done and what ought not to be done. not possessing that discrimination one does anything and everything. then there follows the failure of memory, i.e., of the impressions of the earlier efforts of sense control, when one strives again to control the senses",

  "ya nisa etc.  infatuating is the illusion which is night for all beings.  in that , the sage is awake (vigilant) with the thought  'how it could be avoided'  the stage where the worldly men keep awake i.e., perform multifarious  [worldly]  activities, that stage is the night for the sage, as he is ignorant regarding the worldly activities.   it amounts to this statement :  what is well-known as illusion, its nature is indeed two-ford, viz., to delude and also to wear a deceptive appearance of spinning pleasure.  of them (the two natures),  the worldly man, not considering its former nautre, remains with a memory well teid to the second nature.  on the other hand, the man of yoga, who is contrary to the other,  observes its deluding nature in order to root it out.  thus the man of perfect knowledge, while seeing  [properly],  pays no attention to its nature of spinning pleasure.   his indifference to its nature of spinning pleasure is due to the destruction of his false knowledge.  that stage is night to him, even while he sees.  hence this is strange.  the man of yoga is  awake (or understands)  in the field of wisdom, where everyone else is unconscious (or totally perplexed) ,  but in  [the field]  of ignorance he is not awake  (or does not understand),  where ordinary man is awake (or understands well).  this is also strange.  that is why-",
  "ya, that which , sarva-bhutanam, for all creatures , is nisa, night  which being darkness (tamah) by nature, obliterates distinctions among all things , what is that? that is the reality which is the supreme goal, accessible to the man of steady wisdom. as that which verily appears as day to the nocturnal creatures is night for others, similarly the reality wich is the supreme goal appears to be night, as it were, to all unenlightened beings who are comparable to the nocturnal creatures, because it is beyond the range of vision of those who are devoid of that wisdom. samyami, the self-restrained man, whose organs are under control, i.e. the yogi [the man of realization.] who has arisen from the sleep of ignorance , jagarti, keeps awake , tasyam, in that (night) characterized as the reality, the supreme goal. that night of ignorance, characterized by the distinctions of subjects and objects, yasyam in which , bhutani, the creatures, who are really asleep , are said to be jagrati, keeping awake, in which night they are like dreamers in sleep , sa nisa, it is night , pasyatah, to the seeing , muneh, sage, who perceives the reality that is the supreme goal, because that (night) is ignorance by nature. therefore, rites and duties are enjoined only during the state of ignorance, not in the state of enlightenment. for, when knowledge dawns, ignorance becomes eradicated like the darkness of night after sun-rise. [it may be argued that even after illumination the phenomenal world, though it is known to be false, will continue to be perceived because of the persistence of past impressions , therefore there is scope for the validity of the scriptural injunctions even in the case of an illumined soul. the answer is that there will be no scope for the injunctions, because the man of realization will then have no ardent leaning towards this differentiated phenomenal world which makes an injunction relevant.] before the rise of knowledge, ignorance, accepted as a valid means of knowledge and presenting itself in the different forms of actions, means and results, becomes the cause of all rites and duties. it cannot reasonably become the source of rites and duties (after realization) when it is understood as an invalid means of knowledge. for an agent becomes engaged in actions when he has the idea, 'actions have been enjoined as a duty for me by the vedas, which are a valid means of knowledge' , but not when he understands that 'all this is mere ignorance, like the night'. again, the man to whom has come the knowledge that all these differences in their totality are mere ignorance like the night, to that man who has realized the self, there is eligibility only for renouncing all actions, not for engaging in actions. in accordance with this the lord will show in the verse, 'those who have their intellect absorbed in that, whose self is that' (5.17) etc., that he has competence only for steadfastness in knowledge. objection: may it not be argued that, there will be no reason for being engaged even in that (steadfastness in knowledge) if there be no valid means of knowledge [vedic injunctions.] to impel one to that. [because, without an injunction nobody would engage in a duty, much less in steadfastness to knowledge.] answer: no, since 'knowledge of the self' relates to one's own self. indeed, by the very fact that it is the self, and since the validity of all the means of knowledge culminates in it, [the validity of all the means of knowledge holds good only so long as the knowledge of the self has not arisen.] therefore the self does not depend on an injunction to impel it towards itself. [does the injunction relate to the knowledge of the self. or to the self itself? the first alternative is untenable because a valid means of knowledge reveals its objects even without an injunction. the second alternative also is untenable because the self is self-revealing, whereas an injunction is possible in the case of something yet to be achieved. and one's own self is not an object of that kind.] surely, after the realization of the true nature of the self, there is no scope again for any means to, or end of, knowledge. the last valid means of (self-) knowledge eradicates the possibility of the self's becoming a perceiver. and even as it eradicates, it loses its own authoritativeness, in the same way as the means of knowledge which is valid in dream becomes unauthoritative during the waking state. in the world, too, after the preception of an abject, the valid means of that perception is not seen to be a cause impelling the knower (to any action with regard to that object). hence, it is established that, for an knower of the self, there remains no eligibility for rites and duties. the attainment of liberation is only for the sannyasin [liberation is attained only by one who, after aciring an intellectual knowledge of the self in a general way, is endowed with discrimination and detachment, has arisen above all desires, has become a monk in the primary sense, and has directly realized the self by going through the process of sravana (understanding of upanisadic texts about the self), etc.], the man of enlightenment, who has renounced all desires and is a man of steady wisdom , but not for him who has not renounced and is desirious of the objects (of the senses). such being the case, with a view to establishing this with the help of an illustration, the lord says:",

  "the river waters enter into the sea which is full by itself and is thus the same, i.e., unchanging in shape. the sea exhibits no special increase or decrease, whether the waters or rivers enter it or not. even so do all objects of desire, i.e., objects of sense perception like sound etc., enter into a self-controlled one, i.e., they produce only sensorial impressions but no reaction from him. such a person will attain peace. the meaning is that he alone attains to peace, who by reason of the contentment coming from the vision of the self, feels no disturbance when objects of sense like sound, etc., come within the ken of the senses or when they do not come. this is not the case with one who runs after desires. whoever is agitated by sound and other objects, never attains to peace",
  "apuryamanam etc.   the man of  yoga does not run out for the sake of pleasure ,  but, rather just as the floods of the rivers enter into the sea, the objects of pleasure  [themselves]  continuously enter into him on account of their being peculiar attributes of the sense-organs ,  and they do not create in him waves  [of agitation].  thus the third estion is decided",

  "this is the brahmic seat (eternal state), o son of pritha. attaining to this, none is deluded. being established therein, even at the end of life, one attains to oneness with brahman",

  "this state of performing disinterested work which is preceded by the knowledge of the eternal self and which is characterised by firm wisdom, is the brahmi-state, which secures the attainment of the brahman (the self). after attaining such a state, he will not be deluded, i.e., he will not get again the mortal coil. reaching this state even during the last years of life, he wins the blissful brahman (the self) i.e., which is full of beatitude. the meaning is that he attains the self which is constituted of nothing but bliss.  thus in the second chapter, the lord wanted to remove the delusion of arjuna, who did not know the real nature of the self and also did not realize that the activity named 'war' (here an ordained duty) is a means for attaining the nature of sankhya or the self. arjuna was under the delusion that the body is itself the self, and dominated by that delusion, had retreated from battle. he was therefore taught the knowledge called 'sankhya' or the understanding of the self, and yoga or what is called the path of practical work without attachment. these together have as their objective the attainment of steady wisdom (sthitaprajnata)  this has been explained in the following verse by sri yamunacarya:  sankhya and yoga, which comprehend within their scope the understanding of the eternal self and the practical way of disinterested action respectively, were imparted in order to remove arjuna's delusion.  through them the state of firm wisdom can be reached",

  " if you say, 'after beginning the war, if we withdraw from the battle, the sons of dhrtarastra will slay us all forcibly', be it so. i think that even to be killed by them, who do not know the difference between righteousness and unrighteousness, is better for us than gaining unrighteous victory by killing them. after saying so, arjuna surrendered himself at the feet of the lord, overcome with dejection, saying. 'teach me, your disciple, who has taken refuge in you, what is good for me.'",

  "sanjaya said  having spoken thus to hrsikesa (krsna), gudakesa (arjuna), the afflictor of foes, verily became silent, telling govinda, 'i shall not fight.' fight.'",
  " sanjaya said  thus, the lord, the supreme person, introduced the sastra regarding the self for the sake of arjuna - whose natural courage was lost due to love and compassion in a misplaced situation, who thought war to be unrighteous even though it was the highest duty for warriors (ksatriyas), and who took refuge in sri krsna to know what his right duty was -, thinking that arjuna's delusion would not come to an end except by the knowledge of the real nature of the self, and that war was an ordained duty here which, when freed from attachment to fruits, is a means for self-knowledge. thus,  has it been said by sri yamunacarya: 'the introduction to the sastra was begun for the sake of arjuna, whose mind was agitated by misplaced love and compassion and by the delusion that righteousness was unrighteousness, and who took refuge in sri krsna.'   the supreme person spoke these words as if smiling, and looking at arjuna, who was thus overcome by grief resulting from ignorance about the real nature of the body and the self, but was nevertheless speaking about duty as if he had an understanding that the self is distinct from the body, and while he (arjuna), torn between contradictory ideas, had suddenly become inactive standing between the two armies that were getting ready to fight. sri krsna said, as if in ridicule, to arjuna the words beginning with, 'there never was a time when i did not exist' (ii. 12), and ending with 'i will release you from all sins , grieve not!' (xviii. 66) - which have for their contents the real nature of the self, of the supreme self, and of the paths of work (karma), knowledge (jnana) and devotion (bhakti) which constitute the means for attaining the highest spiritual fulfilment",
  "arjuna said  if thou thinkest that knowledge is superior to action, o krishna, why then, o kesava, dost thou ask me to engage in this terrible action?",
  "'arjuna questioned: my lord! if wisdom is above action, why dost thou advise me to engage in this terrible fight?",
  "arjuna said  o janardana,  if  knowledg is held to be superior to action by you,  then why do you engage me in action that is terrible,  o kesava ?",
  "arjuna said  if, o krsna, you consider that buddhi (knowledge) is superior to works, why do you engage me in this terrible deed?",
  "arjuna said  o janardana (krsna), if it be your opinion that wisdom is superior to action, why they do you urge me to horrible aciton, o kesava ?",
  "'arjuna said  if you consider that knowledge is superior to works, why do you engage me in this terrible deed?' what is said here is this:  if the firm adherence to knowledge is the only means to the vision of the self, then how can one accept the idea that devotion to works (karma) leads to it?  it was said before that this firm devotion to knowledge, which forms the means for the vision of the self, could arise by the cessation of the activities of all the senses and the mind in relation to their respective objects such as sound. if the vision of the self is to be attained, which arises by the cessation of the activities of the senses, i should be guided to engage myself solely to acire firm devotion to knowledge, which is preceded by the abandoning of all works. for what purpose, then, do you engage me in this terrible deed, which consists in the activities of all the senses, and is thus an obstacle for the vision of the self?",
  "o janardana, cet, if it be , te, your , mata, opinion, intention , that buddhih, wisdom , jyayasi, is superior , karmanah, to action-. if the combination of wisdom and action be intended (by the lord), then the means to liberation is only one. [the path combining wisdom and action.] in that case, arjuna would have done something illogical in separating wisdom from action by saying that wisdom is superior to action. for, that (wisdom or action, which is a constituent of the combination) cannot be greater than that (combination, even) from the point of view of the result. [since what is intended is a combination, therefore, the separation of knowledge from action, from the point of view of the result, is not justifiable. when knowledge and action are considered to form together a single means to liberation, in that case each of them cannot be considered separately as producing its own distinct result. arjuna's estion can be justified only if this separation were possible.] similarly, what arjuna said by way of censuring the lord, as it were, in, 'it has been stated by the lord that wisdom is superior to action, and he exhorts me saying, 'undertake action,' which is a source of evil! what may be the reason for this?', and also in, 'tatkim, why then, o kesava , niyojayasi, do you urge , mam, me , to ghore, horrible, cruel , karmani, action , involving injury?'-that (censure) also does not become reasonable. on the other hand, [if the opponent's view be that knowledge is to be combined with rites and duties sanctioned by the vedas and the smrtis in the case of the householders only, whereas for others those sanctioned by the smrtis alone are to be combined with knowledge৷৷., then৷৷.] if it be supposed that the combination (of knowledge) with action sanctioned only by the smrtis has been enjoined for all by the lord, and arjuna also comprehended (accordingly), then, how can the statement, 'why then do you urge me to horrible action', be rational? besides,",

  "from food come forth beings , from rain food is produced , from sacrifice arises rain and sacrifice is born of action",

  "from food are born the creatures , the origin of food is from rainfall , rainfall originates from sacrifice , sacrifice has action as its origin",
  "from food arise all beings , from rain food is produced. these two facts are matters of common experience. 'from sacrifice comes rain' this is known from the scriptures such as, 'the oblations offered in fire reach the sun, and from the sun comes rain' (manu, 6.76), and sacrifice is born out of activities in the form of collecting materials, etc., by the agent. and activity arises from 'brahman', the body born of prakrti",
  "it is a matter of direct perception that annat, from food, which is eaten and is transformed into blood and semen , bhavanti, are born , bhutani, the creatures. anna-sambhavah, the origin of food , is parjanyat, from rainfall. parjanyah, rainfall , bhavati, originates , from yajnat, from sacrifice. this accords with the smrti, 'the oblations properly poured into fire reaches the sun. from the sun comes rain, from rain comes food, and from the sun comes rain, from rain comes food, and from that the creatures' (ma.sm.3.76). (here) sacrifice means its unie [also termed as the unseen result (adrsta).-tr.] result. and that sacrifice, i.e. the unie result, which arises (samudbhavah) from action (karma) undertaken by the priest and the sacrificer, is karma-samudbhavah , it has action for its origin",
  "know thou that action comes from brahma and brahma comes from the imperishable. therefore, the all-pervading (brahma) ever rests in sacrifice",
  "all action originates in the supreme spirit, which is imperishable, and in sacrificial action the all-pervading spirit is consciously present",
  "action arises from the brahman,  you should know this ,  the brhaman arises from what does not stream forth ,  therefore the all-pervading brahman is permanently based on the sacrifice",
  "know that activity springs from 'brahman', i.e., the physical body, 'brahman' arises from the imperishable (self) , therefore the all-pervading 'brahman' is ever established in sacrifice",

  "here ther term, 'brahman' connotes the physical body consisting of modifications of the prakrti , for the prakrti is denoted here by the term 'brahman', as in the scriptural text:  'from him arises, this brahman and this 'brahman' becomes name, form and food' (mun. u., 1.1.9). here also it will be said by sri krsna:  'this great 'brahman' is my womb' (14.3). therefore, the words that 'activity springs from 'brahman' teaches that activity is produced by the physical body which is of the nature of the modification of prakrti. the 'brahman' arises from the imperishable self. here the term, 'imperishable', indicates the individual self. the physical body, which is inhabited by the self who is satisfied by food and drink, is fit for action , hence the physical body which constitutes the instrument of activity is said to be from the imperishable. therefore the 'all-pervading brahman' means here the bodies of all persons of diverse kinds which are the products of prakrti which comprises all material entities, and is hence all-pervading. they, the bodies, are established in sacrifice. the meanig is that the bodies have roots in sacrifice",
  " annat etc.  karma etc.  the things, that are born and are of diversified nature, arise from the food viz , the one which is of the nature of being undifferentiated objct of enjoyment, and which is somehow called by different synonyms like maya, vidya,  kala etc.  the said food also  [arises]  from the 'rain-cloud' i.e., the self, which is of the nature of uninterrupted consciousness.  for, the state of being an object of enjoyment  gains its existence depending on the enjoyer.  that 'rain-cloud'  too viz.,  the enjoyer,  [arises]  from the sacrifice  (yajna) i.e.,  the act  of  enjoying.   for, the state of being an enjoyer depends on the act of enjoying.  and the act of enjoying  [arises]  from action, i.e., from the strength of freedom of action-energy  (freedom in assuming any and every from).   the said freedom also,  though it is uninterrupted,  [arises]  due to the good touch of the brahman  which is full of  freedom and of forms that are conditioned and are many,  (or which is full of freedom and of many forms and is not conditioned) ,  and which is the supreme  soul,  brahman assuming the beings  (tattvas),  viz.,   the mighty isvara  (or mahesvara)  [and the sadasiva]  skipping high on it (brahman).  that brahman, having the rising lord-ship  (or might)  that is pure and unvieled, arises from  what does not stream forth viz.,  the pure supreme  consciousness in which the entire  waves of might  and lordship  have totally calmed  down.  thus, the sacrifice well established  [as an exil] in this manner,  causing a six spoked wheel  to rotate , spins the [two-fold]  yarns - the yarn of emancipation by employing that part fitted with three spokes, and the yarn of  [birth-and-death]  activity by looming with the part of the  [other]  three spokes. thus, the brahman  which is charming with rolling waves of wisdom and ignorance, is established on nothing but the sacrifice.   but certain other commentators  [interpret the passage as ] :  the food is indeed the cause of beings through its graded chages into semen verile and blood ,  the food arises from the rain-cloud  through the rains ,  that rains too arises from the [vedic] sacrifice according to the principle :        'the oblation offered into the [sacrificial] fire, pro-           perly  reaches the sun etc.  (manu. iii, 76).    the  sacrifice  [arises]  from the action ,  the action follows the knowledge, and the knowledge  is from the imperishable.   still others [explain]  differently :  the food that is being enjoyed is the pentad of sense-objects , depending on it, the bhutas (elements) i.e.,  the sense-organs, act , the objects are of the nature of the sparkles of the self.  therefore,  it is only  the self  that is being nourished by enjoying sense-objects.  hence the all-pervading  brahman is established in action.  for it is identical with that",
  "again, [a different reading in place of this is: 'tat ca vividham karma kuto jatamityaha, from where did those various kinds of action originate? in reply the lord says৷৷.' still another reading is: 'tat ca karma brahmodbhavam iti aha, and the lord says: that action has the vedas as its origin.'-vide a.a., 1936, p. 116). astekar's reading is: tat ca evam vidham karma kuto jatamityaha, and from where has this kind of aciton originated? the answers this.'-tr.] viddhi, know , that karma, action , is brahmodbhavam, it has brahma, the veda, as its udbhavam, origin. [here ast. adds 'revealer'-tr.] further, brahma, called the veda, is aksara-samudbhavam, it has aksara, the immutable, brahman, the supreme self, as its source. this is the meaning. since the veda came out, like the breath of a man, from the supreme self itself, called the immutable, therefore the veda, being the revealer of everything, is sarva-gatam, all pervading. even though all-pervading, the veda is nityam, for ever , pratisthitam, based , yajne, on sacrifice, because the injunctions about sacrifices predominate in it",
  "he who does not follow here the wheel thus set revolving, who is of sinful life, rejoicing in the senses, he lives in vain, o arjuna",
  "thus he who does not help the revolving wheel of sacrifice, but instead leads a sinful life, rejoicing in the gratification of his senses, o arjuna, he breathes in vain",
  "whosoever does not roll forward the wheel, thus set in motion in this world, he is a man of sinful life rejoicing in the senses ,  and he lives in vain,  o son of  prtha !",
  "he who does not follow the wheel thus set in motion here, lives in sin, satisfying the senses, o arjuna. he lives in vain",
  "o partha, he lives in vain who does not follow here the wheel thus set in motion, whose life is sinful, and who indulges in the senses",
  "thus this wheel is set in motion by the supreme person:  from food arise embodied selves which are denoted by the word 'beings':  from rain food , from sacrifice rain , sacrifice from activities which constitute the exercise of an agent , and activity from the embodied self , and again the body endowed with life from food. in this manner there is a seence which revolves like a wheel through the mutual relations of cause and effect.  hence, he who is engaged in spiritual practice - whether one is alified for karma yoga or jnana yoga - if he does not follow, i.e., does not keep in motion the wheel which revolves in a circle through mutual relation of cause and effect - that person by not maintaining his bodily subsistence by means of the 'remainder of sacrifice,' lives in sin. his life begins in sin or develops in sin, or is of both these kinds , he lives the life of sin. thus he is a reveller in his senses and not in his self. the senses become the pleasure-gardens of one whose mind and body are not nourished by the 'remainders of sacrifices.' rajas and tamas preponderate in his body. being thus turned away from the vision of the self, he rejoices only in the enjoyment of the senses. therefore, even if he were to attempt for the vision of the self, it will be fruitless. so he lives in vain, o arjuna.  sri krsna now says that there is no need for the performance of the 'great sacrifices' etc., according to his station and stage of life, only in respect of a liberated person whose vision of the self does not depend on any external means",
  "evam etc. on the other hand,  he, who does not accept as stated above, is full of sins.  for, he enjoys  only in the sense-organs and not in the self",
  "o partha, sah, he , jivati, lives , mogham, in vain , yah, who, though competent for action , na anuvartayati, does not follow , iha, here, in the world , cakram, the wheel of the world , evam, thus , pravartitam, set in motion, by god, on the basis of the vedas and the sacrifices , aghayuh, whose life (ayuh) is sinful (agham), i.e. whose life is vile , and indriya-aramah, who indulges in the senses-who has his arama, sport, enjoyment, with objects, indriyaih, through the senses. therefore, the gist of the topic under discussion is that action must be undertaken by one who is alified (for action) but is unenlightened. in the verses beginning from, '(a person does not attain freedom from action by adstaining from action' (4) and ending with, 'you perform the obligatory duties৷৷.and, through inaction, even the maintenance of your body will not be possible' (8), it has been proved that before one attains fitness for steadfastness in the knowledge of the self, it is the bounden duty of a person who is alified for action, but is not enlightened, to undertake karma-yoga for that purpose. and then, also in the verses commencing from '(this man becomes bound) by actions other than that action meant for god' (9) and ending with 'o partha, he lives in vain,' many reasons [such as, that it pleases god, secures the affection of the gods, and so on.] have been incidentally stated as to why a competent person has to undertake actions , and the evils arising from their non-performance have also been emphatically declared. such being the conclusion, the estion arises whether the wheel thus set in motion should be followed by all, or only by one who is ignorant of the self and has not attained to the steadfastness which is fit to be practised by the sankhyas, the knowers of the self, through the yoga of knowledge only, and which is acired by one ignorant of the self through the means of the practice of karma-yoga mentioned above? either anticipating arjuna's estion to this effect, or in order to make the meaning of the scripture (gita) clearly understood, the lord, revealing out of his own accord that the following substance of the upanisads-becoming freed from false knowledge by knowing this very self, the brahmanas renounce what is a compulsory duty for those having false knoweldge, viz, desire for sons, etc., and then lead a mendicant life just for the purpose of maintaining the body , they have no duty to perform other than steadfastness in the knowledge of the self (cf. br. 3.5.1)-has been presented here in the gita, says:",
  "but for that man who rejoices only in the self, who is satisfied with the self and who is content in the self alone, verily there is nothing to do",

  "but the man,  who simply rejoices in the self ,  and who is satisfied in the self , and who delights in the self alone-there exists no action for him to be performed",
  "but the man whose delight is only in the self, who is satisfied with the self, who rejoices in the self, for him nothing remains to be accomplished",
  "but that man who rejoices only in theself and is satisfied with the self, and is contented only in the self-for him there is no duty to perform",
  "but for him, who is not in need of the means of jnana yoga and karma yoga, who finds delight in the self on his own, i.e., who is established in the self, who is satisfied by the self alone and not by food, drink and other things which are other than the self, who rejoices in the self alone and not in pleasure gardens, garlands, sandalpaste, vocal and instrumental music etc., and for whom everything, his subsistence, nourishment and enjoyment, is the self alone - for him nothing remains to be performed for the vision of the self, because the essential nature of the self is perpetually in  his unaided vision",

  "for him there is no interest whatever in what is done or what is not done , nor does he depend on any being for any object",
  "he has nothing to gain by the performance or non-performance of action. his welfare depends not on any contribution that an earthly creature can make",
  "no purpose is served for him by what he has done or by what he has not done.  for him there is  hardly any dependenc on any purpose among all beings",
  "he has no purpose to gain by work done or left undone, nor has he to rely on any end",
  "for him there is no concern here at all with performing action , nor any (concern) with nonperformance. moreover, for him there is no dependence on any object to serve any purpose",
  "thus, for such a one there is no purpose, i.e., nothing to be gained from work done as a means for the vision of the self, nor is he subject to any evil or calamity from work left undone, because his vision of the self does not rest on any external means. to such a person who has turned by himself away from non-intelligent matter which is different from the self, there is nothing acceptable as a purpose to be gained from the constituents of prakrti and their products , only if there were such a purpose, there would be the need for the means of retreat therefrom. for, the adoption of the means is only for effecting such a retreat. but he is verily liberated.  non-pursuit of the means for vision of the self is only for that person whose vision of the self no longer depends on any means. but karma yoga is better in gaining the vision of the self for one who is in pursuit of the means for that vision, because it is easy to perfom, because it is secure from possible error, because the contemplation of the true nature of the self is included in it, and because even for a jnana yogin the performance of minimum activity is necessary. for these reasons, karma yoga is better as a means for the vision of the atman",
  "moreover, tasya, for him, who rejoices in the supreme self , na, there is no , artham, concern , eva, at all , krtena, with performing action. objection: in that case, let there be some evil called sin owing to non-performance! reply: iha, here, in this world , na, nor is there , for him kascana, any (concern) , akrtena, with nonperfromance. certainly there is no evil in the form of incurring sin or in the form of self-destruction. ca, moreover , asya, for him , na asti, there is no , kascit artha-vyapasrayah sarva-bhutesu, dependence on any object, from brahma to an unmoving thing, to serve any purpose. vyapasrayah is the same as vyapasrayanam, dependence, which is possible of being created by action promted by necessity. (for him) there is no end to gain by depending on any praticular object, due to which there can be some action for that purpose. 'you (arjuna) are not established in this fullest realization which is comparable to a flood all around.'",
  "therefore without attachment, do thou always perform action which should be done , for by performing action without attachment man reaches the supreme",
  "therefore do thy duty perfectly, without care for the results, for he who does his duty disinterestedly attains the supreme",

  "do not bewilder the minds of ignorant aspirants by saying that there is, besides karma yoga, another way to the vision of the self. they cannot practise jnana yoga on account of their incomplete knowledge of the self, and attachment to action. they are alified for karma yoga because of their being fit only for activity on account of the subtle impressions of their beginningless karma. what then follows from this?  it is this:  even though one is alified for jnana yoga because of the complete knowledge of the self, one should do work, holding the view as said previously, that karma yoga by itself without jnana yoga is an independent means for the vision of the self. he should thus generate love for all types of activity among those who do not know the complete truth.  sri krsna declares (in the verses 27 to 30) the way in which the self is to be contemplated on as not being an agent as reired by karma yoga, after demonstrating the difference between the enlightened and unenlightened among those practising karma yoga",

  "the blessed lord said  o unblemished one, two kinds of steadfastness in this world were spoken of by me in the days of yore-through the yoga of knowledge for the men of realization , through the yoga of action for the yogis",
  "the lord said  you have not properly understood what i taught you before. in this world, full of people with varying degrees of alifications, i have taught in the days of yore two ways, that of knowledge (jnana yoga) and that of works, according to the alifications of aspirants. there is no contradiction in this. it is not possible for all people of the world in whom the desire for release has arisen, to become capable immediately for the practice of jnana yoga. but he who performs the worship of the supreme person without desire for fruits and thery gets completely rid of inner impurities and keeps his senses unagitated - he becomes competent for the path of knowledge.  that all activities are for performing the worship of the supreme person will be taught in the gita verse, 'he from `whom the activities of all beings arise and by whom all this is pervaded - by worshipping him with his duty man reaches perfection' (18.46). earlier also performance of activities without any attachment to the fruits is enjoined by the verse beginning with. 'you have the right to work alone ৷৷.' (2.47). next for those whose intellect has been redeemed by this kind of discipline, is enjoined jnana yoga by the words, 'when a man renounces all the desires ৷৷.' (2.55).  conseently, firm devotion to jnana yoga is taught only to the sankhyas, i.e., those persons who are competent to follow the discipline of the knowledge of the self, and karma yoga to yogins, i.e., to those competent for the path of work. sankhya means buddhi and those who are endowed with the buddhi (intellectual or mental disposition) having only the self for its object, are sankhyans. therefore those who are not fit for this are alified for karma yoga. those who are possessed of buddhi which is agitated by objects of the senses, are the persons alified for karma yoga, whereas those whose buddhi is not thus agitated, are alified for jnana yoga. therefore nothing contradictory and confusing is taught.  it is said in the next stanza that jnana yoga is difficult to practise all at once, even when the desire for release arises in any worldy person:",

'adhyatma-cetas' is that mind which is focussed on the self by knowledge of the essential nature of the self as declared in hundreds of vedic texts. that this individual self constitutes the body of the supreme self and is actuated by him, is taught by sruti texts like:  'he who has entered within, is the ruler of all beings and is the self of all' (tai. ar., 3.11), 'him who has entered inside and is the doer' (ibid., 3.23), 'he who, dwelling in the self, is within the self, whom the self does not know, whose body is the self, who controls the self from within - he is your internal ruler and immortal self' (br. u., 3.7.22). smrti texts also speak in the same manner:  'him who is the ruler of all' (manu, 12.122). sri krsna will say later on: 'and i am seated in the hearts of all , from me are memory, knowledge and the faculty of reason' (15.15) , 'the lord, o arjuna, lives in the heart of everything causing them to spin round and round by his power, as if set on a wheel' (18.61). hence, dedicate to me, the supreme person, all actions considering them as done by me, by contemplating on the self as actuated by me by reason of its constituting my body. and do every thing, considering the actions as my worship only , becoming free from desire for fruits and therefore free from selfishness as regards actions, engage in acts like war etc., devoid of 'fever', i.e., the excitement caused by passions like anger.  contemplate that the supreme person, lord of all, principal of all, gets done his own works only for the purpose of getting himself worshipped with his own instruments, namely, the individual selves which belong to him and are his agents. become free from selfish attachment to action. also be free from the feverish concern originating from such thoughts as 'what will become of me with an ancient, endless accumulation of evil arising from beginningless time?'  perform karma yoga with ease, for the supreme person himself, worshipped by acts, will free you from bondage. his lordship and principalship over all are settled by sruti texts like:  'him who is the supreme and great lord of lords, him the supreme divinity of divinities' (sve. u., 6.7), 'the lord of the universe' (tai. na., 11.3), 'the supreme ruler of rulers' (sve. u., 6.6-7). isvaratva is the same as sesitva, which means controllership.  sri krsna declares that this alone is the essential meaning of the upanisads:",

'all beings follow their nature.' beings in conjunction with non-conscient matter, all follow only subtle impressions which have continued to come from time immemorial. what can the control enjoined by sastras, do to these beings who follow their subtle impressions?  sri krsna expounds the way by which individuals are overpowered to follow their respective natures:",

  "an unavoidable attraction has been fixed for organs of sense like ear towards the objects like sound, and for organs of action like that of tongue towards their objects like tasty food. this longing is in the form of desire to experience these objects, which is caused by old subtle impressions. when their experience is thwarted, an unavoidable aversion is experienced. thus, these two, attachment and aversion, bring under their control one who aspires to follow jnana yoga, and forcibly engage him in actions appropriate to them, in spite of his having established some sort of control over the senses.  such an aspirant fails to get the experience of the self, and therefore becomes completely lost. so no one practising jnana yoga should come under the sway of attachment and aversion, which are ruinous. these two, attachment and aversion, are indeed his unconerable foes that deter him from the practice of jnana yoga",

  "therefore karma yoga is better than jnana yoga. for, it forms one's own duty, since it is natural to one and easy to perform, and though defective, is free from liability to interruption and fall. jnana yoga, on the other hand, though performed well for some time, constitutes the duty of another, as it is difficult to practise for one conjoined with prakrti. it is therefore liable to interruption. for a person who lives practising karma yoga - which is his duty because he is alified for it - even death without success in one birth does not matter. for, in the next birth with the help of the experience already gained in the previous birth, it will be possible for him to perform karma yoga without any impediments. jnana yoga is fraught with fear because of the possibility of errors for anyone who is conjoined to prakrti. it is another's duty, on account of it being not easily adoptable by him",

'knowledge arises৷৷.acts. one sees the self in oneself as does one (see oneself) in a cleaned surface of a mirror'.-tr.] (mbh. sa. 204.8). this is the import. from the statement that one does not attain freedom from action by abstaining from actions, it may be concluded that one attains freedom from action by following the opposite course of performing actions. what, again, is the reason that one does not attain freedom from action by abstaining from actions? the answer is: because performing actions is itself a means to freedom from action. indeed, there can be no attainment of an end without (its) means. and karma-yoga is the means to the yoga of knowledge characterized by freedom from action, because it has been so established in the upanisads and here as well. as for the upanisads, it has been shown in the texts, 'the brahmanas seek to know it through the study of the vedas, sacrifices, (charity, and austerity consisting in a dispassionate enjoyment of sense-objects)' (br. 4.4.22), etc. whch deal with the means of realizing the goal of knowledge under discussion, viz the realm of the self, that the yoga of karma is a means to the yoga of knowledge . and even here (in the gita), the lord will established that, 'but, o mighty-armed one, renunciation is hard to attain without (karma-)yoga' (5.6) , 'by giving up attachment, the yogis undertake work৷৷.for the purification of themselves' (5.11) , 'sacrifice, charity and austerity are verily the purifiers of the wise' (18.5), etc. objection: is it not that in such texts as-'extending to all creatures immunity from fear' (na. par. 5.43), (one should take recourse to freedom from action)-, it is shown that attainment of freedom from action follows even from the renunciation of obligatory duties? and in the world, too, it is a better known fact that freedom from action follows abstention from actions. hence also arises the estion, 'why should one who desires freedom from action undertake action?' reply: therefore the lord said: na ca, nor , samadhi-gacchati, does he attain , siddhim, fulfilment steadfastness in the yoga of knowledge, characterized by freedom from action , sannyasanat eva, merely through renunciation-even from the mere renunciation of actions which is devoid of knowledge. what, again, is the reason that by the mere giving up of actions which is not accompanied with knowledge, a person does not attain fulfulment in the form of freedom from actions? to this ery seeking to know the cause, the lord says:",

  "you perform the obligatory duties, for action is superior to inaction. and, through inaction, even the maintenance of your body will not be possible",
  "'obligatory' (niyatam) means 'concomitant' (vyaptam) , for action is concomitant with that which is conjoined with prakrti or the body. the contact with prakrti has arisen from beginingless subtle impressions (vasanas). you must perform work, because the performance of action is easy and may not cause accidents by reason of its being obligatory. action is superior to non-action, i.e., even to the devotee of jnana. because of the instruction at the beginning (of this context), 'no man experiences freedom from activity' (3.4), devotion to jnana alone is indicated by the word, 'non-action' (akarma). even in the case of one alified for devotion to jnana, devotion to karma indeed is better because jnana-nistha is difficult to perform and liable to accidents, as it has not been practised previoulsy and as it does not come to one naturally. subseently it will be described how, one with the knowledge of the true nature of the self can carry on actions along with that knowledge. conseently, we should take the meaning here to be that, because knowledge of the self too is included in karma yoga, this kind of yoga is superior.  this statement on the superiority of activity (karma yoga) over jnana yoga is valid even when there is competency for one to adopt jnana yoga. for, if you abandon all activities to alify yourself for jnana yoga, then, for you, who is thus inactive while following jnana yoga, even the nourishment of the body, which is necessary even for jnana-nistha, will not be achieved. the body has to be necessarily sustained until the means are executed to the full. performing 'great sacrifices' with the help of honestly earned wealth, the body should be sustained by consuming the remainders left after such sacrifices. this is made clear from scriptural texts like, 'when the food is pure, the sattva (mind or inner organ) becomes pure , when the sattva is pure, then the remembrance (meditation) will be steady' (cha. u., 7.26.2). sri krsna himself will declare:  'the sinful ones who cook food for their own sake eat sin (3.13).  conseently,even the sustenance of the body will not be possible in the case of one who practises jnana-nistha, and does not act. in other ways also karma yoga is superior to jnana yoga even in respect of one who is alified for jnana-nistha , for, obligatory and occasional rites like the 'great sacrifices' must be carried out by one who follows jnana yoga too, as he has to sustain the body until he attains perfection. besides, the understanding of the true nature of the self is incorporated in karma yoga, as it involves the contemplation of the self as being a non-agent. it is also in line with the nature of life (prakrti). karma yoga, is for these reasons easier and it is free from danger of downfall. therefore, you must perform karma yoga only. this is the purport of the verse.  if it is contended that any action such as earning money implies 'i-ness', 'my-ness' etc., and will therefore be disturbing to the senses, and that such a person devoted often to works will be in bondage through subtle impressions of his acts, sri krsna says:",

  "he who seeth inaction in action and action in inaction, he is wise among men , he is a yogi and performer of all actions",

  "he who finds inaction in action, and action in inaction, he is the wise one [possessed of the knowledge of brahman] among men , he is engaged in yoga and is a performer of all actions!",
  "here by the term 'non-action', the knowledge of the self, which is distinct from action and which forms the subject under consideration, is meant. 'he who sees non-action in action and also action in non-action,' denotes him who can perceive knowledge of the self even while action is being performed and who can also perceive action while engaged in non-action, i.e., knowledge of the self. what is the import of this saying?  what is taught here is this:  one can perceive, by constant contemplation on the truth about the self, that the action that is being performed in itself is a form of knowledge. one can also perceive that this knowledge is also of the form of karma because of its being contained in karma yoga. both these (i.e., action in the form of knowledge and knowledge in the form of actions) are accomplished by contemplation on the true nature of the self, even while work is being performed. thus, he who can see actions as included in contemplation on the reality of the self, is wise, i.e., he knows the full meaning of the sastras , he is fit among men, i.e., fit to attain release. he alone has fulfilled all actions, i.e., carried out the entire purpose of the sastras. [the purport is that no contradiction between knowledge and action is felt by one who knows the philosophy of the self].  how is the form of knowledge accomplished through works which are obviously activities that are being performed?  sri krsna explains:",
  "karmani etc :  he who finds the actions,  [seemingly]  of his own,  to be non-actions [of his], on account  of his being  non-performer  [of any action], because of his state of  total  tranility ,  and he who recognises  the non-actions  [of his]  i.e.,  the actions  performed  by others,  as actions  being performed  by himself  (or who  recognises the  non-actions undertaken by others as being undertaken   by himself), because  of his intrinsic  nature of the fully  risen  state ,  that person  alone  is a man of  intelligence in the  midst of all ,  and  he [alone]  performs  action fully i.e., in its entirity.  therefore  what fruit  should be  borne  for him by what action ?  this is  at the stage  of rising.  but, at  the stage  of  total  tranility  he injures, or cuts all actions.  thus he performs  all action  or performs  no action.  this is the secret  and sacred  knowledge,  got by sitting near  (by serving)  the feet  of the  preceptors.\t\t\t\t\t  therefore -",
  "since engagement and non-engagement (in action) depend on an agent, therefore, yah, he who , pasyet, ie. pasyati, finds , akarma, inaction, absence of action , karmani, in action-karma means whatever is done, action in general , in tha action- , and yah, who , finds karma, action , akarmani, in inaction, in the absence of action , sah, he , is buddhiman, a wise one , manusyesu, among men. all dealings involving an act, accessories, etc. exist certainly on the plane of ignorance, [both engagement and non-engagement presuppose agentship and an act of some kind. this, however, holds good on the plane of ignorance, but not on that of self-realization.] only so long as one has not attained to the reality. he is a yogi, yuktah, engaged in yoga , and a krtsna-karma-krt, performer of all actions. one who discriminates between action and actions. one who discriminates between action and inaction is praised thus. objection: well, what is meant by this contradictory statement, 'he who finds inaction in action', and 'action in inaction'? for action cannot become inaction, nor inaction action. that being so, how can a witness have (such) an incongruous perception? vedantin: is it not that [ast. reads na in place of nanu.-tr.] to an ordinary foolsih observer, that which is reality is inaction appears as action, and similarly, action itself as inaction? that being so, in order to show things as they are the lord says, 'he who finds inaction in action', etc. therefore there is no incongruity. besides, the alifications such as 'intelligent' etc. (thus) become logical. and by saying, 'there is something to be known', is implied the perception of things as they are. moreover, freedom from evil cannot follow from an erroneous perception , whereas it has been said, 'by knowing which you will become free from evil'. therefore, one account of action and inaction being perceived contrarily by the creatures, the lord's utterance, 'he who finds inaction in action,' etc. is for dispelling their contrary perception. not that in the empirical plane inaction has action as its receptacle, like a plum in a bowl! nor even has action inaction as its receptacle, because inaction is a negation of action. therefore, action and inaction are actually perceived contrarily by the ordinary persons-like seeing water in a mirage, or silver in nacre. objection: is it not that to every one action is action itself? never is there an exception to this.  vedantin: that is not so, becuase when a boat is moving, motionless trees on the bank appear to move in the opposite direction to a man on the boat , an absence of motion is noticed in distant moving things which are not near one's eyes. similarly, here also occurs the contrary perceptions, viz seeing action in inaction under the idea, 'i am doing', [ast. omits 'aham karomi iti, under the idea, 'i am doing''.-tr.] and seeing, inaction in acion,-because of which it is said, 'he who finds inaction in action,' etc. in order to eliminate them. as such, although this answer has been given more than once, still a man becomes repeatedly deluded under the influence of a totally opposite perception. and forgetting the truth that has been heard again and again, he repeatedly raises false issues and estions! and therefore, observing that the subject is difficult to understand, the lord gives his answer again and again. the absence of action in the self-well-known from the vedas, smrtis and logic, as stated in, '(it is said that) this is unmanifest , this is inconceivable' (2.25), 'never is this one born, and never does it die' (2.20 , ka. 1.2.18), etc.-has been and will be spoken of. the contrary perception of action in that actionless self, i.e. in inaction, is very deep-rooted, owing to which 'even the intelligent are confounded as to what is action and what is inaction.' and as a conseence of the superimposition of aciton pertaining to the body etc. on the self, there arises such ideas as, 'i am an agent , this is my action , its result is to be enjoyed by me.' similarly, with the idea, 'i shall remain iet, whery i shall be free from exertion, free from activity, and happy', and superimposing on the self the cessation of activities pertaining to the body and organs and the resulting happiness, a man imagines, 'i shall not do anything , i shall sit ietly and happily.' that being so, the lord says, 'he who finds inaction in action,' etc. with a view to removing this contrary understanding of man. and here in this world, though action belonging to the body and organs continues to be action, still it is superimposed by everyone on the acitonless, unchanging self, as a result of which even a learned person things, 'i act.' therefore, in action (karmani), which is universally considered by all people to be inherent in the self, like the perception of motion in the (stationary) trees on the bank of a river-(in that action) he who contrariwise finds the fact of inaction, like perceiving absence of motion in those trees-. and, in inaction (akarmani) in the cessation of the activities pertaining to the body and organs and ascribed to the self in the same way that actions are ascribed-, in that action, he who sees action because of egoism being implicit in the idea, 'i am happily seated ietly, without doing anything'- , he who knows thus the distinction between action and inaction, is wise, is learned among men , he is engaged in yoga, he is a yogi, and a performer of all actions. and he, freed from evil, attains fulfilment. this is the meaning. this verse is interpreted by some in another way.  how? (thus:) 'since the daily obligatory duties (nityakarmas) certainly have no results when performed as a dedication to god, therefore, in a secondary sense, they are said to be inaction. again, the non-performance of these (nitya-karmas) is inaction , since this produces an evil result, therefore it is called action, verily in a figurative sense. that being so, he who sees inaction in the daily obligatory duties (nitya-karmas) owing to the obsence of their results-in the same way as a cow that does not yield milk is said to be not a cow, though in reality it is so-so also, in the non-performance of the daily obligatory duties, i.e. in inaction, he who sees action since that yields results such as hell etc৷৷.' this explanation is not logical, because freedom from evil as a result of such knowledge is unreasonable, and the utterance of the lord in the sentence, '৷৷.by knowing which you will become freed from evil', will be contradicted. how? even if it be that liberation from evil follows from the performance of nitya-karmas, it cannot, however, follow from the knowledge of the absence of their results. for it has not been enjoined (anywhere) that knowledge of the nityakarmas (themselves), leads to the result of freedom from evil. nor has this been stated here by the lord himself. hery is refuted the 'seeing of action in inaction' [as explained by others.-tr.], for (according to the opponent) 'seeing of action in inaction' has not been enjoined here [here, in the present verse.] as a duty, but (what has been enjoined is) merely that performance of the nityakarmas is obligatory. moreover, no result can accrue from the knowledge that evil arises from non-performance of nityakramas. nor even has non-performance of nityakarmas. been enjoined as something that should be known. besides, such results as freedom from evil, wisdom, engagement in yoga, and being a performer of all actions cannot reasonably follow from a false perception of action as inaction. nor is this a eulogy of false perception. [the stated results accrue from correct knowledge, not from false perception , and correct knowledge alone is praise-worthy.] indeed, false perception is itself an abvious form of evil! how can it bring about liberation from another evil? surely, darkness does not become the remover of darkness! opponent: well, the seeing of inaction in action, or the seeing of action in inaction-that is not a false perception. vadantin: what then? opponent: it is a figurative statement based on the existence or the non-existence of results. vedantin: not so, because there is no such scriptural statement that something results from knowing action as inaction and inaction as action, even in a figurative sense. besides, nothing particular is gained by rejecting what is heard of (in the scriptures) and imagining something that is not. further, it was possible (for the lord) to express in his own words that there is no result from the nityakarmas, and that by their non-performance one would have to go to hell. under such circumstances, what was the need of the ambiguous statement, 'he who sees inaction in action,' etc., which is misleading to others? this being the case, such an explanation by anyone will be clearly tantamount to imagining that statement of the lord as meant for deluding people. moreover, this subject-matter (performance of nityakarmas) is not something to be protected with mystifying words. it is not even logical to say that the subject-matter will become easy for comprehension if it is stated again and again through different words. for, the subject-matter that was stated more clearly in, 'your right is for action alone' (2.47), does not need any repetition. and everwhere it is said that whatever is good and ought to be practised deserves to be understood , anything purposeloss does not deserve to be known. besides, neither is false knowledge worth aciring nor is the semblance of an object presented by it worth knowing. nor even can any evil, which is an entity, arise from the non-performance of nityakarmas, which is a non-entity, for there is the statement, 'of the unreal there is no being' (2.16), and (in the upanisad) it has been pointed out, 'how can existence originate from nonexistence?' (ch. 4.2.2). since emergence of the existent from the nonexistent has been denied, therefore anyone's assertion that the existent originates from the nonexistent will amount to saying that a non-entity becomes an entity, and an entity becomes a non-entity! and that is not rational because it runs counter to all the means of valid knowledge. further, the scriptures cannot enjoin fruitless actions, they being naturally painful , and it is illogical that what is painful should be done intentionally. also, if it is admitted that falling into hell results from their non-performance (i.e. of the nityakarmas), then that too is surely a source of evil. in either case, whether one undertakes them or not, the scriptures will be imagined to be useless. and there will be a contradiction with your own standpoint when, after holding that the nityakarmas are fruitless, you assert that they lead to liberation. therefore, the meaning of 'he who finds inaction in action,' etc. is just what stands out literally. and the verse has been explained by us accordingly. the aforesaid perception of 'inaction in action,' etc. is being praised:",

(further,) from the specification, sariram karma kurvan (by doing actions with the body), and from the use of the word kevala (only), it will amount to saying that one incurs sin by performing actions, called righteous and unrighteous, which can be accomplished with the mind and speech and which come within the purview of injunction and prohibition. even there, the statement that one incurs sin by performing enjoined actions through the mind and speech will involve a contradiction , even in the case of doing what is prohibited, it will amount to a mere purposeless restatement of a known fact. on the other hand, when the sense conveyed by sariram karma is taken as acctions merely for the purpose of maintaining the body, then the implication will be that he does not do any other work as can be accomplished physically, orally, or mentally, which are known from injunctions and prohibitions (of the scriptures) and which have in view seen or unseen results , while he appears to people to be working with those very body (speech) etc. merely for the purpose of maintaining the body, yet he does not incur sin by merely making movements of the body etc., because from the use of the word kevala, (merely) it follows that he is devoid of the sense of agentship implicit in the idea, 'i do.' since there is no possibility of a person who has reached such a state incurring evil as suggest by the word sin, therefore he does not become subject to the evil of transmigration. that is to say, he certainly becomes free without any obstacle since he has all his actions burnt away by the fire of wisdom. this verse is only a reiteration of the result of full illumination stated earlier. it becomes faultless by accepting the interpretation of sariram karma thus.  in the case of the monk who has renounced all possessions, since owning food etc. meant for the bare sustenance of the body is absent, therefore it becomes imperative to beg for alms etc. for the upkeep of the body. under this circumstance, by way of pointing out the means of obtaining food etc. for the maintenance of the body of a monk as permitted by the text, 'what comes unasked for, without forethought and spontaneously৷৷.' [unasked for: what comes before the monk gets ready for going out for alms , without forethought: alms that are not given with abuses, and have not fallen on the ground, but collected from five or seven houses without any plan , spontaneously: alms brought to one spontaneously by devoted people.] (bo. sm. 21. 8. 12) etc., the lord says:",

'brahmaarpanam' is the oblation, of which the instrument is brahman. the oblation, just like the instrument with which it is offered, is also brahman. it is offered by the agent brahman into the fire of brahman. he is the brahma-karma-samadhi who contemplates thus on all acts as filled with the supreme brahman or as having the supreme brahman as the self. he who contemplates on brahman as the soul of all actions, reaches brahman alone, as his own self has the supreme brahman as its self. the meaning is that the individual self - which is brahman because of its having brahman as its self - has to realise its own real nature. all actions performed by an aspirant for release have the form of knowledge because of their association with the contemplation of the supreme brahman as their self. they are a direct means for the vision of the self without the meditation of jnana yoga.  thus, sri krsna, after explaining how karma takes the form of knowledge, now speaks of the various kinds of karma yoga",
  "brahmarpanam etc.  that is to be offered to the brahman (list) :  that, the offering of which is in the  brahman i.e.,  the reentrance of which is only into that, just from which it has originated.  the brahman (2nd) :  that which is the same as the entire universe what we see - this is that very oblation. into the brahman-fire : into the fire which is the same as the brahman,  the highly tranil  supreme consciousness.  by the  brahman : by one or the other action.  is poured : is offered  for the augmentation of it's lumination. hence, a man of  yoga,  whose brahman-action of this sort is itself a deep concentration - by him,  the brahman  alone is [a goal] to be attained i.e., to be realised, not anything else , for there is no other thing.   alternatively [in the verse] the meaning  'by him' brings  in, by implication, the meaning  'by whom'.  so the following  is the alignment  [of words] :  the action,  in which the brahman-oblation, intended to be an offering to a deity of the brahman-nature, has been indeed poured into the brahman-fire  by the sacrificer, identical with the brahman - that very brahman-action of this sort is itself a deep contemplaiton, because it is the means to gain the innate nature  of  the self.  and what is attained by this brahman-action-contemplation is the very brahman itself  and not any other fruit.  indeed it has been maintained  [by the lord]  as :             'the way in which  men  resort to me,            [in the same way  i favour them]'. (iv, ii)    'those, who have cultivated the nature of performing sacrifice which is nothing but me, but of the  delimited nature - they attain, therefore, the fruit of similar  [limited]  nature.  this is different  matter.  but, with regard to those  who have realised  the nature  of the sacrifice identical  with me ( the supreme consciousness),  the unlimited and  complete ,  how could they be entertaining a craving for a bit of limited fruit ?'  this is the idea here.   thus, a  top secret is furnished  by this and by the succeeding  verses.  that has been also detailed by us (ag.) - even though our intelligence is limited - as far as  our intelligence  permits, by not transgressing the instructions of our preceptors. maybe,  for a person without a regular course of the oral tradition  [of the system],  this looks  like a picture painted on the sky and does not appeal to his mind.  on that account  we should not be blamed.   it has been declared by some, in this context, that [here in this verse]  the oblation, the fire and the instruments like sruk [used for offering the oblation into the fire in the sacrifice]  and also the act [of offering] are all adjectives alifying the brahmam.  this  [explanation] deserves to be ignored.  for, these commentators have not troden on the path of the secret tradition",
  "brahma-arpanam, the ladle is brahman: the knower of brahman perceives the instrument with which he offers oblation in the fire as brahman itself. he perceives it as not existing separately from the self, as one sees the non-existence of silver in nacre. in this sense it is that brahman itself is the ladle-just as what appears as silver is only narcre. (the two words brahma and arpanam are not parts of a compound word, samasa.) the meaning is that, to a knower of brahman, what is perceived in the world as ladle is brahman itself.  similarly, brahma-havih, the oblations is brahman: to him, what is seen as oblations is nothing but brahman. in the same way, brahma-agnau, (-this is a compound word-) in the fire of brahman: the fire into which oblation is hutam, poured , brahmana, by brahman, by the agent, is brahman itself. the meaning is that brahman itself is the agent (of the offering). that he makes the offering-the act of offering-, that is also brahman. and the result that is gantavyam, to be reached by him , that also is brahma eva, surely brahman. brahma-karma-samadhina, by him who has concentration on brahman as the objective: brahman itself is the objective (karma) , he who has concentration (samadhi) on that is brahma-karma-samdhih. the goal to be reached by him is brahman alone. thus, even the action undertaken by one who desires to prevent mankind from going astray is in reality inaction, for it has been sublated by the realization of brahman. this being so, in the case of the monk from whom aciton has dropped off, who has renounced all activity, viewing his knowledge as a (kind of) sacrifice, too, becomes all the more justifiable from the point of view of praising full realization. that is, whatever is well known as ladle etc. in the context of a sacrifice, all that, in the context of the self, is brahman itself to one who has realized the supreme truth. if not so, then, since all in brahman, it would have been uselesss to specifically mention ladle etc. as brahman. therefore, all actions cease to exist for the man of realization who knows that brahman itself is all this. and this follows also from the absence (in him) of the idea of accessories. [see note on p.211.-tr.] for the act called 'sacarifice' is not seen to exist without being in association with the idea of accessories. all such acts as agnihotra etc. are associated with the ideas of such accessories as making an offering etc. to the particular gods who are revealed in the scriptures, and with the idea of agentship as also desire for results. but they are not found bereft of the ideas of such distinctions as exist among action, accessories and results, or unassociated with the ideas of agentship hankering for results. this (apparent) (activity of the man of knowledge), however, stands dissociated from the ideas of differences among the accessories like ladle etc., actions and results, which get destroyed by the knowledge of brahman. hence, it is inaction to be sure. and thus has it been shown in, 'he who finds inaction in action' (18), 'he really does not do anything even though engaged in action' (20), 'the organs act on the objects of the organs' (3.28), 'remaining absorbed in the self, the knower of reality should think, 'i certainly do not do anything'' (5.8), etc. while pointing out thus, the lord demolishes in various places the ideas of differences among actions, accessories and results. and it is also seen in the case of rites such as agnihotra undertaken for results (kamya), that the agnihotra etc. cease to be (kamya) rites undertaken for selfish motives when the desire for their results is destroyed. similarly, it is seen that actions done intentionally and unintentionally yeild different results. so, here as well, in the case of one who has his ideas of distinctions among accessories like ladle etc., actions and results eliminated by the knowledge of brahman, even activites which are merely external movements amount to inaction. hence it was said, 'gets totally destroyed.' here some say: that which is brahman is the ladle etc. it is surely brahman itself which exists in the five forms [asscessories that can be indicated by the five grammatical case-ending, viz nominative, objective, instrumental, dative and locative. (as for instance, the sacrificer, oblation, ladle, sacrificial fire, and brahman.-tr.) of accessories such as the ladle etc. and it is itself which undertakes actions. there the ideas of ladle etc. are not eradicated, but the idea of brahman is attributed to the ladle etc. as one does the ideas of visnu etc. to images etc., or as one does the idea of brahman ot name etc. reply: true, this could have been so as well if the context were not meant for the praise of jnanayajna (knowledge considered as a sacrifice). here, however, after presenting full realization as expressed by the word jnana-yajna, and the varieties of rites as referred to by the word yajna (sacrifice), knowledge has been praised by the lord in, 'jnana-yajna (knowledge considered as a sacrifice) is greater than sacrifices reiring materials' (33). and in the present context, this statement, 'the ladle is brahman' etc., is capable of presenting knowledge as a sacrifice , otherwise, since brahman is everything, it will be purposeless to speak specially only of ladle etc. as brahman. but those who maintain that one has to superimpose the idea of brahman on the ladle etc., like superimposing the idea of visnu and others on images etc. and of brahman on name etc., for them the knowledge of brahma stated (in the verse) cannot be the intended subject-matter dealt with here, because according to them ladle etc. are the (primary) objects of knowledge (in the context of the present verse). besides, knowledge in the form of superimposition of an idea cannot lead to liberation as its result , and what is said here is, 'brahman alone in to be realized by him'. also, it is inconsistent to maintain that the result of liberation can be achieved without full realization. and it goes against the context-the context being of full realization. this is supported by the fact that (the subject of ) full realization is introduced in the verse, 'he who finds inaction in action,' and at the end (of this chapter) the conclusion pertains to that very subject-matter. the chapter comes to a close by eulozing full realization itself in, 'jnana-yajna (knowledge considered as a sacrifice) is greater than sacrifices reiring materials', 'achieving knowledge, one৷৷.attains supreme peace,' (39) etc. that being so, it is unjustifiable to suddenly say out of context that one has to superimpose the idea of brahman on the ladle etc. like the superimposition of the idea of visnu on images. therefore this verse bears the meaing just as it has been already explained. as to that, after having presented knowledge as a sacrifice, other sacrifices also are being mentioned now in, the verses beginning with, '(other yogis undertake) sacrifice to gods alone,' etc., for eulogizing that knowledge:",
  "some yogies perform sacrifice to the gods alone , while others (who have realised the self) offer the self as sacrifice by the self in the fire of brahman alone",

  "some karma yogins resort to the sacrifice relating to gods, i.e., the sacrifice which takes the form of worshipping gods. the meaning is that they have steadfast devotion only in this. 'others offer sacrifice into the fire of brahman solely by means of sacrifice.' here the term, 'sacrifice' is used in the sense of the oblation, the ladle etc., reired for performing a sacrifice and therefore they are said to constitute 'sacrificing.' these are of the nature of brahman. 'offer by means of sacrifice' indicates the ladle and other implements for the accomplishment of sacrifice",
  "daivam etc.  the devas are the sense-organs that are playful.  the yajna that stands based  on them is nothing but the act of receiving objects of their own.  certain persons are thoroughly devoted only to that yajna, i.e.,  they gain the gain of their own self by examining this (yajna)  from its root .  that is why they are men of yoga ,  for, they are absorbed  in the yoga  permanently at all stages.  indeed in yogin  the suffix  ini,  a synonym of matup, here signifies  'perpetual connection'.  further,  they (yogins) pour,  as an offering,  the self-same  yajna,  above defined, into the brhaman-fire that is insatiable i.e. that cannot be satisfied.  thus  [the verse] has been interpreted by some.   however,  the sage  (the author of the gita)  does not violate the context.   hence,  that meaning which exists in his heart we shall show :  certain  masters of  yoga  perform godly sacrifice i.e.,  sacrifice, consisting of external objects,  and intending only deities like indra etc., of varied forms.  further, with a single conviction that  'it is a yajna and a thing to be performed',  i.e., with no craving for fruit, they offer the same sacrifice, that  is being  performed, into the  brahman - fire which is insatiable i.e.,  difficult to satisfy.  thus even those,  who perform  sacrificial rites with material objects, attain the supreme brahman.  for, it is going to be declared in the seel :  'all these persons too have understood sacrifice'  (iv, 30 below).  the vedic text also [says] :         'the gods offered sacrifice  [just] as sacrifice'.

'for faultless brahman (individual self) is alike everywhere , therefore, abide in brahman' (5.19). and then you will see all beings without any exception in me, because of the similarity of nature of the pure selves with one another and with my nature. for sri krsna will teach later on:  'resorting to this knowledge and partaking of my nature' (14.5). so the euality of the selves, devoid of name and form, with the nature of the supreme, is known from the texts like:  'then the wise, shaking off good and evil, stainless, attain supreme eality' (mun. u., 3.1.3). therefore all selves dissociated from prakrti are eal in nature to one another and eal in nature to the lord of all.

  "'the ignorant,' i.e., one devoid of knowledge received through instruction, 'the faithless' or one who has no faith in developing this knowledge taught to him, i.e., who does not strive to progress ickly, and 'the doubting one,' i.e., one who is full of doubts in regard to the knowledge taught - such persons perish, are lost. when this knowledge taught to him about the real nature of the self is doubted, then he loses this material world as also the next world. the meaning is that the ends of man, such as dharma, artha and karma which constitute the material ends or fulfilments, are not achieved by such a doubting one. how then can man's supreme end, release be achieved by such a doubting one?  for all the ends of human life can be achieved through the actions which are prescribed by the sastras, but their performance reires the firm conviction that the self is different from the body. therefore, even a little happiness does not come to the person who has a doubting mind concerning the self",
  " sraddhavan etc.  ajnah etc.  here the idea of the passage is this :  the  incoming of faith and the performance of activities intending this  [knowledge],  both spring up soon no doubt, if one, being a believer, entertains no doubt.  therefore, one should remain being favoured by the preceptors and the scriptures, and not entertaining any doubt.  for, the doubt is a destroyer of everything  [good].  indeed a person with doubt knows nothing, because he does not have faith.  hence one should remain without doubt.\t\t\t\t\t  the subject matter that has been  elaborated in this entire chapter is now summarised by a pair of the [following] verses :",
  "ajnah, one who is ignorant, who has not known the self , and asradda-dhanah, who is faithless , [ast. adds here: guruvakya-sastresu avisvasavan, who has no faith in the instructions of the teacher and the scriptures.-tr.] and samsaya-atma, who has a doubting mind , vinasyati, perishes. although the ignorant and the faithless get ruined, yet it is not to the extent that a man with a doubting mind does. as for one with a doubting mind, he is the most vicious of them all. how? na ayam lokah, neither this world which is familiar , na, nor also , parah, the next world , na sukham, nor happiness , asti, exist , samsaya-atmanah, for one who has a doubting mind. for doubt is possible even with regard to them! therefore one should not entertain doubt. why?",
  "he who has renounced actions by yoga, whose doubts are rent asunder by knowledge, and who is self-possessed  actions do not bind him, o arjuna",
  "but the man who has renounced his action for meditation, who has cleft his doubt in twain by the sword of wisdom, who remains always enthroned in his self, is not bound by his acts",
  "o dhananjaya !  actions do not bind him who has renounced [all] actions through yoga , who has cut off his doubts by the sword of knowledge , and who is a master of his own self",
  "actions do not bind him, o arjuna, who has renounced them through karma yoga and whose doubts are sundered by knowledge, and who therefore possesses a steady mind",
  "o dhananjaya (arjuna), actions do not bind one who has renounced actions through yoga, whose doubt has been fully dispelled by knowledge, and who is not inadvertent",
  "the countless ancient karmas which constitute the cause of bondage, do not bind him who has renounced actions through karma yoga in the manner explained before, who has sundered all doubts concerning the self by the knowledge of the self in the manner explained before, and who is of steady mind, i.e., unshakable, with the mind focussed steadily on the meaning that has been forth",
  "yoga-etc.  renunciation of actions becomes possible only through yoga and not otherwise.  this has been discussed also [in the seel]",
  "yoga-sannyasta-karmanam, one who has renounced actions through yoga: that person who is a knower of the supreme goal, by whom actions called righteous or unrighteous have been renounced through the yoga characterized as the knowledge of the supreme goal. how does one become detached from actions through yoga? the lord says: he is jnana-samchinna-samsayah, one whose doubts (samsaya) have been fully dispelled (samchinna) by knowledge (jnana) characterized as the realization of the identity of the individual self and god. o dhananjaya, he who has thus renounced actions through yoga, atmavantam, who is not inadvertent, not careless , him, karmani, actions, seen as the activities of the gunas (see 3.28) , na nibadhnanti, do not bind, (i.e.) they do not produce a result in the form of evil etc. since one whose doubts have been destroyed by knowledge-arising from the destruction of the impurities (of body, mind, etc.) as result of the practise of karma-yoga-does not get bound by acitons owing to the mere fact of his actions having been burnt away by knowledge , and since one who has doubts with regard to the practice of the yogas of knowledge and actions gets ruined-",
  "therefore with the sword of the knowledge (of the self) cut asunder the doubt of the self born of ignorance, residing in thy heart, and take refuge in yoga. arise, o arjuna",
  "therefore, cleaving asunder with the sword of wisdom the doubts of the heart, which thine own ignorance has engendered, follow the path of wisdom and arise!'",
  "therefore, thus cutting off, by means of knowledge-sword, the doubt that has sprung from ignornace and exists in [your] heart, practise the yoga !  stand up !  o descendant of bharata !",
  "therefore, sunder, with the sword of knowledge, this doubt present in your heart resulting from ignorance concerning the self. practise this yoga, o arjuna, and rise up",
  "therefore, o scion of the bharata dyasty, take recourse to yoga and rise up, cutting asunder with the sword of knowledge this doubt of your own in the heart, arising from ignorance",
  "therefore, after sundering this doubt concerning the self, born of beginningless ignorance and present in the heart, by the sword of the knowledge of the self in the manner explained before, practise the karma yoga taught by me. for that, rise up, o arjuna",
  "tasmat  etc.  cutting asunder the doubt,  you must practise,  by the said method, the yoga, the dexterity in action ,  and then stand up i.e.,  perform your activities simply with the idea that they are to be performed",
  "tasmat, therefore, o scion of the bharata dynasty , atistha, take recourse to, i.e. undertake , yogam, yoga -performance of actions, which is a means to full illumination , and now, uttistha, rise up for battle , chittva, cutting asunder , jnanasina, with the sword of knowledge-knowledge is full illumination, which is a destroyer of such defects as sorrows, delusion, etc. , that itself is the sword , with that sword of knowledge- ,enam, this , samsayam, doubt , atmanah, of your own, which is a source of one's own ruin and is most sinful , hrtstham, in the heart, residing in the intellect , ajnana-sambhutam, arising from ignorance, born of non-discrimination. the word atmanah is used because doubt concerns oneself. indeed, another's doubt cannot be removed by someone else. hence the word 'own' is used. so, although the doubt is with regard to the self, it is really one's own",
  "the blessed lord said  many births of mine have passed as well as of thine, o arjuna , i know them all but thou knowest not, o parantapa (scorcher of foes)",

  "though i am unborn, of imperishable nature, and though i am the lord of all beings, yet, governing my own nature, i am born by my own maya",
  "have no beginning. though i am imperishable, as well as lord of all that exists, yet by my own will and power do i manifest myself",
  "though  [i am]  unborn and the changeless self ,  though i am the the lord of  [all]  beings , yet presiding over my own nature i take birth by my own trick-of-illusion",
  "though i am birthless and of immutable nature, though i am the lord of all beings, yet by employing my own nature (prakrti) i am born out of my own free will",
  "though i am birthless, undecaying by nature, and the lord of beings, (still) by subjugating my prakriti, i take birth by means of my own maya",
  "without forsaking any of the my special alities, as supreme rulership, birthless, imperishability etc., i am born by my free will. prakrti means one's own nature. the meaning is that by employment of my own nature and taking a form of my choice, i incarnate by my own will (maya).  the character of my own nature becomes evident from the following srutis:  'him who is of sun-like colour, beyond darkness (tamas)' (sve. u., 3.8), 'him who abides beyond rajas (active matter)' (sama 17.1.4.2) , 'this golden person who is within the sun' (cha. u. 1.6.6) , 'within the heart, there is the person consisting of mind, immortal and golden' (tai. u. 1.6.1) , 'all mortal creatures have come from the self-luminous person' (yaj., 32.2) , 'whose form is light, whose will is truth, who is the self of ethereal space, who contains all actions, contains all desires, contains all odours, contains all tastes' (cha. u., 3.14.2) , 'like a raiment of golden colour' (br. u., 4.3.6).  'atma-mayaya' means through the maya which belongs to myself. here the term maya is identical with knowledge as stated in the lexicon of yaska:  'maya is wisdom, knowledge.' further there is the usage of competent people:  'by maya, he knows the good and bad of his creatures.' hence by my own knowledge means 'by my will.' hence, without abandoning my essential attributes which belong to me the lord of all, such as being free of sins, having auspicious attributes etc., and creating my own form similar to the configuration of gods, men etc., i incarnate in the form of gods etc. the sruti teaches the same thing:  'being unborn, he is born in various forms' (tai. a., 3.12.7). the purport is that his birth is ite unlike that of ordinary beings. the dissimilarity consists in that he is born out of his own will unlike ordinary beings whose birth is necessitated by their karma. thus constured, there is no contradiction also between what was taught earlier and what is taught later as in the statements:  'many births of mine have passed, o arjuna, and similarly yours also. i know them all' (4.5) , 'i incarnate myself' (4.7) , and 'he who thus knows in truth my birth and work' (4.9). [all this elaboration is meant to refute the doctrine of mere apparency of incarnations as taught by the advaitins. ramanuja, as stated in his introduction to the bhasya, upholds the absolute reality of incarnations.]  sri krsna now specifies the times of his incarnations",

(5.8), understands that all actions proceed from brahman (prakrti) , renounces all attachment while engaging himself in all actions, reflecting, 'i am doing nothing.' such a person, though existing in contact with prakrti, is not contaminated by sin which is the result of the wrong identification of the atman with prakrti and is the cause of bondage. just as a lotus leaf is not wetted by water, actions do not affect or defile a person with sin, if he is free from such identification with the body",

  "aste, he continues , sukham, happily , sannyasya, having given up , sarva-karmani, all actions-nitya, naimittika, kamya and nisiddha (prohibited actions) , [see note on p. 128.-tr.] manasa, mentally, through discriminating wisdom-i.e. having given up (all actions) by seeing inaction in action, etc. freed from the activities of speech, mind and body, effortles, placid in mind, and devoid of all external wants which are different from the self, he continues happily. this is what has been said. where and how does the vasi, man of self-control, i.e. one who has his organs under control, remain? this is being answered: nava-dvare pure, in the town with nine gates, of which seven [two ears, two eyes nostrils, and mouth.] are in the head for one's own experiences, and two are below for urination and defecation. as possessed of those gates, it is called the 'town with nine gates'. being like a town, the body is called a town with the self as its only master. and it is inhabited by the organs, mind, intellect and objects, like citizens, as it were, which serve its needs and which are productive of many results and experience. renouncing all actions, the dehi, embodied one, resides in that town with nine gates. objection: what is the need of this specification? for all embodied beings, be they monks or not, reside in bodies to be sure! that being so, the specification is needless. the answer is: the embodied one, however, who is unenlightened, who perceives merely the aggregate of the body and organs as the self, he, in his totality, thinks, 'i am in a house, on the ground, or on the seat.' for one who experiences the body alone as the self, there can certainly be no such conviction as, 'i am in the body, like one's being in a house.' but, for one who realizes the self as distinct from the aggregate of body etc. it becomes reasonable to have the conviction, 'i am in the bdoy. it is reasonable that as a result of knowledge in the form of discriminating wisdom, there can be a mental renunciation of the actions of others, which have been ignorantly superimposed on the supreme self. even in the case of one in whom has arisen discriminating wisdom and who has renounced all actions, there can be, like staying in a house, the continuance in the body itself-the town with nine gates-as a conseence of the persistence of the remnants of the results of past actions which have started bearing fruit, because the awareness of being distinct (from the body) arises while one is in the body itself. form the point of veiw of the difference between the convictions of the enlightened and the unenlightened persons, the alifying words, 'he continues in the body itself', do have a purpose to serve. although it has been stated that one continues (in the body) by relinishing actions of the body and organs ignorantly superimposed on the self, still there may be the apprehesion that direct or indirect agentship inheres in the self. anticipating this, the lord says: na eva kurvan, without himself doing anything at all , and na karayan, not causing (others) to do, (not) inducing the body and organs to activity. objection: is it that the direct or indirect agentship of the embodied one inheres in the self and ceases to be after renunciation, as the movement of a traveller ceases with the stoppage of his movement? or, is it that they do not exist owing to the very nature of the self? as to this, the answer is: the self by its nature has neither direct nor indirect agentship. for it was stated, 'it is said that৷৷.this (self) is unchangeable' (2.25). 'o son of kunti, although existing in the body, it does not act, nor is it affected' (13.31). and it is also stated in the upanisad, 'it seems to meditate, as it were , it seems to move, as it were' (br. 4.3.7)",
  "neither agency nor actions does the lord create for the world, nor union with the fruits of actions. but it is nature that acts",
  "the lord of this universe has not ordained activity, or any incentive thereto, or any relation between an act and its consequences. all this is the work of nature",
  "the lord (self) acires neither the state of being a creator of the world, nor the actions, nor the connecting with the fruits of their actions.  but it is the inherent nature [in it] that exerts",
  "the lord of the body (the self i.e., the jiva) does not create agency, nor actions, nor union with the fruits of actions in relation to the world of selves. it is only the inherent tendencies that function",
  "the self does not create agentship or any objects (of desire) for anyone , nor association with the results of actions. but it is nature that acts",
  "when the world of embodied selves exists in conjunction with the prakrti in the form of gods, animals, men, immobile things etc., the master (prabhu i.e., the jiva who is the master of the body), who is not subject to karma and is established in its own essential nature, does not bring about:  (i) the agency of gods, men etc. (ii) their manifold and particular actions and (iii) their connection with the fruits in the form of embodiment as gods etc., resulting from their actions. who then brings about agency etc.?  it is only the tendencies that act. a tendency (svabhava) is subtle impressions (vasanas) originating from prakrti. the meaning is that agency, etc., do not originate from the natural or pristine condition of the self but are generated by the subtle impressions created by misconceiving those forms of prakrti etc., as of the self. this is the result of the conjunction of the self with prakrti in the form of gods, etc., which has been generated by the flow of previous karmas brought about in beginningless time",
  "na  kartrtvam etc.  this soul does not do anything for anything.  but, its exertion is only its inherent nature and it is not due to any desire for results.  for, the bhagavat, the conscious energy itself  whose ultimately true inherent nature is the illumination-bliss-freedom-of-will, and which brings out, merely by its own nature, the continuous series of creation, manitenance and withdrawl of all (the universe) , hence in it,  there is never a departure, even to a little extent, from its own inherent nature.  hence there is no such thing as a particular stage of being a creator i.e., a creatorhood separate [from itself].  because that does not exist, what actions can be there ?  if actions are not there,  the fruit is to be of what or for whom ?  then what connection could be three with the fruit of action ?   [further],  'action'  in this context is [only]  the  kriya-[sakti] or creative energy  [which is nothing but his will],  and 'result of action'  too in only the fruit of this kriya.  for example, the activity like rotating the [potter's]  wheel by the stick is not [actually]  different  [from what is to be created  i.e.,  the pot].  nor the creator of the pot is different from it.  for, all exist within the conscious  energy. therefore, it is only the animate  sovereign  supreme  lord  that manifests in this and that form.  therefore there exist no activity and its result etc.,  apart from  that.  this is demonstrated conclusion  [of the scriptures].\t\t\t  so, if there is no activity or its result  [as stated above],  then even the result, ordained in  [the scriptural] injunctions  cannot have a status of being produced by the unseen  [cause].  after saying this in the other first  hemistich  [of the following verse],  the lord justifies in the other hemistich the same statement with reference to the men of mundane life :-",
  "prabhuh, the self , na srjati, does not create , lokasya, for anyone , kartrtvam, agentship, by saying 'do this' , or even karmani, any objects-such objects as chariot, pot, palace, etc. which are intensely longed for , nor even karma-phala-samyogam, association with the results of actions-association of the creator of a chariot etc. with the result of his work. objection: if the embodied one does not do anything himself, and does not make others do, then who is it that engages in work by doing and making others do? the answer is: tu, but , it is svabhavah, nature- one's own (sva) nature (bhava)-characterized as ignorance, maya, which will be spoken of in, 'since this divine maya' (7.14) , pravartate, that acts. but from the highest standpoint-",
  "the lord takes neither the demerit nor even the merit of any , knowledge is enveloped by ignorance, thery beings are deluded",
  "the lord does not accept responsibility for any man's sin or merit. men are deluded because in them wisdom is submerged in ignorance",
  "the omnimanifest (soul) takes [upon itself] neither sin nor merit [born] of any [action].  but, the perfect knowledge is clouded by illusion and hence the creatures are deluded",
  "the all-pervading one takes away neither the sin nor the merit of any one. knowledge is enveloped by ignorance. creatures are thery deluded",
  "the omnipresent neither accepts anybody's sin nor even virtue. knowledge remains covered by ignorance. thery the creatures become deluded",
  "because, it, the atman is 'all-pervading', i.e., is not limited to particular area or space included in the bodies of gods, men etc. , it is not the relative or the enemy of any one. for this reason it does not take away or remove the evil or suffering of anyone such as a son who is related and therefore dear to one , nor does it take away, i.e., remove the happiness of anyone whom it deems with aversion. all this is the effect of vasanas or subtle impressions of prakrti.  how does do these contrary vasanas originte in the case of one whose intrinsic nature is a described above?  in answer it is said that knowledge is enveloped by the darkness of ignorance. the atman's knowledge is enveloped, i.e., contracted by preceding karmas which are opposed to knowledge, so that a person may be alified to experience the fruits of his own karma. it is by this karma, which contracts knowledge, and can join the jiva with the bodies of gods etc., that the misconception that the bodies are the selves is produced. conseently there will originate the vasanas or the unconscious subtle impressions born of such misapprehension of the self and the inclination to undertake actions corresponding to them.  sri krsna now brings into proper seence what has been taught before in the following verses:  'you will completely cross over the sea of all your sins with the boat of knowledge' (4.36), and 'the fire of knowledge reduces all karmas to ashes in the same way' (4.37), and 'for there is no purifier here eal to knowledge' (4.38)",
  "nadatte etc.  the sinful acts and the like have been effected not by the soul , but they have been effected by the illusion belonging to it, just as a poison is effected in the nectar by a doubt.   therefore-",
  "vibhuh, the omnipresent , na adatte, neither accetps , kasyacit, anybody's-even a adevotee's , papam, sin , na ca eva, nor even , does he accept sukrtam, virtue offered by devotees. why then are such virtuous acts as worship etc. as also sacrifices, charity, oblation, etc. worship etc. as also sacrifices, charity, oblation, etc. offered by devotees? to this the lord says: jnanam, knowledge, discriminating wisdom , remains avrtam, covered , ajnanena, by ignorance. tena, thery , jantavah, the creatures, the non-discriminating people in the world , muhyanti, become deluded thus-'i do , i make others do , i eat , i make others eat.'",
  "but to those whose ignorance is destroyed by the knowledge of the self, like the sun, knowledge reveals the supreme (brahman)",
  "surely wisdom is like the sun, revealing the supreme truth to those whose ignorance is dispelled by the wisdom of the self",
  "in the case of those whose illusion has been, however, destroyed by the self-knowledge, then for them that knowledge illumines itself, like the sun",
  "but for those in whom this ignorance is destroyed by the knowledge of the self, that knowledge, in their case, is supreme and shines like the sun",
  "but in the case of those of whom that ignorance of theirs becomes destroyed by the knowledge (of the self), their knowledge, like the sun, reveals that supreme reality",
  "while all these selves are thus deluded, in the case of enlightened souls, their delusive ignorance - which envelops knowledge and which is of the form of accumulated, beginningless and endless karma - is destroyed by knowledge. as already described this knowledge is produced by the teachings of the scriptures about the real nature of the self, which are enriched by daily practice. the purity of this knowledge is unexcelled. and in the case of those selves who regain the knowledge that is natural to them, it is found that it is unlimited and uncontracted and illumining everything like the sun.  plurality of the selves in their essence is expressly mentioned in the case of those whose ignorance is overcome, in the expression 'for those' in the text. what was stated at the commencement, 'there never was a time when i did not exist' (2.12) is expressed here with greater clarity. moreover, this plurality is not due to limiting adjuncts imposed on a single universal self. for, as stated here, there cannot be any trace of such adjuncts for those whose ignorance is destroyed, and still they are described as a plurality. hence knowledge is taught as an attribute inseparable from the essential nature of the self, because a difference between the self and its knowledge is made out in the statement, 'knowledge, in their case illuminates like the sun'. by the illustration of the sun, the relation of the knower to his knowledge is brought out to be similar to the luminous object and its luminosity. therefore, it is appropriate to understand that knowledge contracts by karma in the stage of samsara and expands in the stage of moksa (release). [in this system the atman has two forms of jnana or knowledge - dharmi-jnana (self-awareness) and dharma-bhuta-jnana (awareness of objects other than itself). it is the latter that is contracted  by ignorance and expands by knowledge. see intrdocution.]",
  "jnanena etc.  when however the  illusion is destroyed by  knowledge, then  the natural  capacity of  knowledge,  in illuminating  itself  and  other things starts to work automatically just as the sun does when the darkness is lost.  indeed when the doubt  [of poison] is completely rooted out, the nectar does  the work of the nectar just automatically.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  but  this is possible for  those who have their intellect and mind gone to this  [self]  and have abandoned  [all]  other  activities.  to make this idea clear  [the lord] says -",
  "tu, but , yesam, in the case of those creatures , of whom tat ajnanam, that ignorance , atmanah, of theirs-being covered by which ignorance creatures get deluded- , nasitam, becomes destroyed , jnanena, by knowledge, by discriminating knowledge concerning the self , tesam, their , jnanam, knowledge , adityavat, like the sun , prakasayati, reveals, in the same way as the sun reveals all forms whatever , tat-param, that supreme reality, the reality which is the highest goal, the totality of whatever is to be known",
  "their intellect absorbed in that, their self being that, established in that, with that for their supreme goal, they go whence there is no return, their sins dispelled by knowledge",
  "meditating on the divine, having faith in the divine, concentrating on the divine and losing themselves in the divine, their sins dissolved in wisdom, they go whence there is no return",
  "those, who have their intellect and self (mind) gone to this , who have established themselves in this and have this [alone] as their supreme goal , and who have washed off their sins by means of  [perfect]  knowledge-they reach a state from which there is no more return",
  "those whose intellects pursue it (the self), whose minds think about it, who undergo discipline for it, and who hold it as their highest object, have their impurities cleansed by knowledge and go whence there is no return",
  "those who have their intellect absorbed in that, whose self is that, who are steadfast in that, who have that as their supreme goal-they attain the state of non-returning, their dirt having been removed by knowledge",
  "'those whose intellects pursue it,' i.e., those who have determined to have the vision of the self in this way , 'those whose minds think about it,' i.e., those whose minds have the self for their aim, those who undergo discipline for it, i.e., those who are devoted to the practices for its attainment , 'those who hold it as their highest object,' i.e., those who consider it as their highest goal - such persons, having their previous impurities cleansed by the knowledge which is practised in this way, attain the self as taught. 'from that state there is no return' - the state from which there is no return means the state of the self. the meaning is that they attain the self which rests in its own nature",
  "because it is only the inherent nature that exerts thus, therefore  [the lord] says that the men,  who have destroyed their illusion would remain as follows -",

  "samnyasastu etc.  [here] the word tu is used in the sense of   'affirmation'  and it is to be construed in a different order.  [hence the meaning is] :  for a person without yoga, it is certainly hard to attain renunciation.  because, as it has been already shown logically, it is difficult  to renounce actions.  but, it is certainly easy for men of yoga to attain this.  that has been said earlier",

[karma-yoga leads to enlightenment through the stages of attenuation of attachment, withdrawal of the internal and external organs from their objects, and their inclination towards the indwelling self. (also see commentary on 5.12).] the monasticism under discussion is called brahman because it leads to knowledge of the supreme self, as stated in the upanisad, 'nyasa (monasticism) is brahman. brahman is verily the supreme' (ma. na. 21.2) brahman means monasticism in the real sense, consisting in steadfastness to the knowledge of the supreme self",

  "but a karma yogin remains engaged in the performance of pure actions prescribed by the sastras, which are of the nature of propitiation of the supreme person. by this, he becomes purified in mind. he thus subdues his self, i.e., subdues his mind easily, because his mind is engaged in the virtuous actions he has been performing before. therefore his senses are subdued. his self is said to have become the self of all beings. because of his being devoted to contemplation on the true nature of the self, he finds that his self is similar to the self of all beings like gods etc. one who contemplates on the true nature of the self understands that all selves are of the same form or nature. the distinctions obtaining among gods, men etc., cannot pertain to the form of the self, because those distinctions are founded on particular modifications of prakrti i.e., the bodies of beings. sri krsna will teach:  'for the brahman (an individual self), when untainted, is the same everywhere' (5.19). the meaning of this is that when dissociated from the prakriti, i.e., the body, the self is of the same nature everywhere, i.e., in the bodies of gods, men etc. it is of the same form of knowledge. the meaning is that one, who has become enlightened in this way, active though he be, is not tainted on account of erroneously conceiving what is other than the self (the body) as the self. he is not at all associated therewith. therefore, he attains the self without any delay.  as karma yoga is superior to jnana yoga because it is more easily pursued and is more rapidly efficacious in securing the fruits, listen to its reirement:",

'one whose delusion is abandoned is one by whom the delusion of identifying the self with prakrti (body), which is in reality distinct from the self, is not rejected by the contemplation of the real nature of the self. one who is not of this kind is one whose delusion is not abandoned. one who is not of this kind cannot become a karma yogin of the type described here. it has already been said:  'he whose every undertaking is free from desire for fruits and delusive identification of the body with the self ৷৷.'

[thoughts about an object lead to the desire for it, which in turn leads to actions for getting it. (also see note under 4.19)] also, even while performing actions, gives up the thought for results. pointing out this idea, the lord says: hi, for , kascit, nobody, no man of action whosoever , asannyasta-sankalpah, who has not given up expactaions-one by whom has not been renounced expectation, anticipation, of results ,bhavati, becomes, i.e. can become , yogi, a yogi, a man of concentration, because thought of results is the cause of the disturbance of mind. therefore, any man of action who gives up the thought of results would become a yogi, a man of concentration with an unperturbed mind, because of his having given up thought of results which is the cause of mental distractions. this is the purport. thus, because of the similarity of real monasticism with karma-yoga from the point of veiw of giving up by the agent, karma-yoga is extolled as monasticism in, 'that which they call monasticism, know that to be yoga, o pandava.' since karma-yoga, which is independent of results, is the remote help to dhyana-yoga, therefore it has been praised as monasticism. thereafter, now the lord shows how karma-yoga is helpful to dhyana-yoga:",

  "  yatah etc.  upto adhigacchati.  from whatever objects  the mind returns,  immediately after  its return,  let him ieten it on the self.  otherwise, being not firmly  established  [in the self],  the mind  would again  take hold of nothing but the sense-objects.  but the bliss, assuming  the roll of an agent  (or subject, kartv-bhuta)  comes to the object  (karmabhuta),  viz., the man-of-yoga, whose  mind remains ite in the self.  by this way alone the men-of-yoga attain the brahman easily and not by  [any] difficult yoga etc.   this is the idea  [here]",

[liberation is conceived of in two ways-total cessation of sorrows, and attainment of unsurpassable bliss.]",
  "with the mind harmonised by yoga he sees the self abiding in all beings and all beings in the self , he sees the same everywhere",
  "he who experiences the unity of life sees his own self in all beings, and all beings in his own self, and looks on everything with an impartial eye ,",
  "he, who has yoked the self in yoga and observes everything eally perceives the self to be abiding in all beings and all beings to be abiding in the self",

  "one who has his mind self-absorbed through yoga, and who has the vision of sameness every-where, see this self existing in everything, and every-thing in his self",
  "(i) on account of the similarity between one self and other selves when they are separated from prakrti (i.e., the body), all selves are by themselves only of the nature of knowledge. inealities pertain only to prakrti or the bodies they are embodied in. one whose mind is fixed in yoga has the experience of the sameness of the nature of all the selves as centres of intelligence, the perceived difference being caused only by the body. when separated from the body all are alike because of their being forms of centres of intelligence. an enlightened yogin therefore sees himself as abiding in all beings and all beings abiding in his self in the sense that he sees the similarity of the selves in himself and in every being. when one self is visualised, all selves become visulaised, because of the similarity of all selves. this is supported by the statements:  'he sees sameness everywhere' (6.29). the same is again referred to in, 'this yoga of eality which has been declared by you' (6.33), and the statement 'the brahman when uncontaminated is the same everywhere' (5.19)",

  "karma yoga is said to be the means for an aspirant for release who 'seeks to climb the heights of yoga,' i.e., the vision of the self. for the same person, when he has climbed the 'heights of yoga,' i.e., when he is established in yoga - tranility, i.e., freedom from actions is said to be the means. a man should perform actions until he has attained release (moksa) in the form of the vision of the self. full release comes only with the fall of the body. the 'vision of the self' referred to here is called moksa by courtesy.  when does not become established in yoga?  sri krsna replies:",
  "aruruksoh etc  for a sage :  for a man of wisdom.  action :  that which reires to be performed. cause  (1st) : a means to attain.  quietude : to remain uninterrupted at the stage  [already]  achieved.  here cause  (2nd) is an indicator.\t\t  the same idea is made clear as-",

  "(ii) he who, having reached the highest stage of maturity, views similarity of nature with me, i.e., sees similarity of all selves to myself when they are freed from good and evil and when they remain in their own essence, as declared in the sruti, 'stainless he attains supreme degree of eality' (mun. u., 3.1.3) , and 'sees me in all selves and sees all selves in me.' that is, on viewing one of them (selves), one views another also to be the same, because of their similarity to one another. to him who perceives the nature of his own self, i am not lost on account of my similarity to him i.e., i do not become invisible to him. he (the yogin) viewing his own self as similar to me, always remains within my sight when i am viewing myself, because of similarity of his self with me.  sri krsna describes a still more mature steps (of yoga):",
  "yo mam etc.  loss :  i.e.,  on account of serving no  purpose  [on the part of a thing].  for example : he who does not see the all-pervasive nature of the supreme self,  from him the supreme self has fled away, because it does not reveal its own  nature.  further,  this aggregate of objects,  which is being perceived,  remains settled  down in the supreme  self,   which is the  very nature of  their  illumination  (being known). now, whosoever fails to veiw the object as such, he gets  lost from  the naute of that supreme self.  for, nothing shines without it.   on the other hand, he who finds me  (the supreme consciousness) as immanent in all - for him i am not lost ,  because  i appear [to him] in my own nature.  [again], when he perceives objects in me-when his perceiverhood is complete on account of the possibility of illumination and manifestation of these objects due to this - then he is not lost for the supreme self",

[the idea is to prevent misconstruing the verse as meaning  that one shares the joy and misery of all as his own. it means only that the highest type of yogins understand that the self is unrelated to the pain and pleasures of his own body-mind. he understands also that the same is the case with other selves.]",
  "atma-etc.  'that he finds the pleasure  and pain of all on analogy of himself'.  this is only a statement of characteristic mark [of the yogin] ,  and it is not an injunction enjoining a new action",

  "when this yogin, because of his natural disposition to the experience of the self, loses attachment, i.e., gets detached from sense-objects, i.e., things other than the self, and actions associated with them - then he has abandoned all desires and is said to have climbed the heights of yoga. therefore, for one wishing to climb to yoga, but is still disposed to the experience of the sense-objects, karma yoga consisting of the practice of detachment to these objects, becomes the cause for success in yoga. therefore one who wishes to climb to yoga must perform karma yoga consisting in the practice of detachment from sense-objects.  sri krsna further elucidates the same:",
  "yada etc.  what is desired by the senses :  objects of senses. the actions for them :  actions such as earning the objects and so on.\t\t\t\t  in this  [path of]  knowledge one should be necessarily attentive.  this [the lord] says-",
  "hi, verily , yada, when , a yogi who is concentrating his mind, sarva-sankalpa-sannyasi, who has given up thought about everything-who is apt to give up (sannyasa) all (sarva) thoughts (sankalpa) which are the causes of desire, for things here and hereafter , na anusajjate, does not become attached, i.e. does not hold the idea that they have to be done by him , indriya-arthesu, with regard to sense-objects like sound etc. , and karmasu, with regard to actions-nitya, naimittika, kamya and nisiddha (prohibited) because of the absence of the idea of their utility , tada, then, at that time , ucyate, he is said to be , yoga-arudhah, established in yoga, i.e. he is said to have attained to yoga. from the expression, 'one who has given up thought about eveything', it follows that one has to renounce all desires and all actions, for all desires have thoughts as their source. this accords with such smrti texts as: 'verily, desire has thought as its source. sacrifices arise from thoughts' (ma. sm. 2.3) , 'o desire, i know your source. you surely spring from thought. i shall not think of you. so you will not arise in me' (mbh. sa. 177.25). and when one gives up all desires, renunciation of all actions becomes accomplished. this agrees with such upanisadic texts as, '(this self is identified with desire alone.) what it desires, it resolves , what it resolves, it works out' (br. 4.4.5) , and also such smrti texts as, 'whatever actions a man does, all that is the effect of desire itself' (ma. sm. 2.4). it accords with reason also. for, when all thoughts are renounced, no one can even move a little. so, by the expression, 'one who has given up thought about everything', the lord makes one renounced all desires and all actions. when one is thus established in yoga, then by that very fact one's self becomes uplifted by oneself from the worldly state which is replete with evils. hence,",

  "the lord said  neither here nor there is destruction for him who has begun yoga with faith and has then fallen away from it. the meaning is that there is no destruction either in the form of failure of attainment of desires or in the form of pratyavaya, which means the attainment of what is undesirable because of defects in the performance of works. therefore no one who practises this incomparably auspicious yoga ever comes to an evil end in the present, past or future.  sri krsna explains how this is so:",
  "partha etc.  the idea  [here]  is :  there is no  [estion of]  destruction for the fallen-from-yoga,  either is this  world or in the other ,  because his faith is not lost.  he has indeed  performed as auspicious  act of  seeking  the bhagavat,  and that act is not of perishing nature as the agnistoma  sacrifice etc., are",

  "'yoginam', which is the genitive case, has to be taken in the sense of the ablative. in the verses beginning with, 'he sees the self as abiding in all beings' (6.29), yogins at four degrees of attainment have been mentioned. since the yogin who is now mentioned in this passage cannot be included in the four types mentioned earlier, the genitive case specifying one out of many will be inappropriate here.  in 'api sarvesam,' those who practise austerities etc., are referred to by the word 'sarva' (all). according to the principle set forth, here also the case ending has to be taken as ablative. the meaning therefore is that the yogin who is now referred to, is the most integrated compared with those mentioned earlier and all other types. compared to this yogin, the differences in point of superiority and inferiority among the other yogins such as the performers of austerities etc., are of no significance like mustard-seeds compared to mount meru. even though there exists smallness and bigness in relation to one another among mustard-seeds, still when compared to meru, such distinctions among them have no significance, as they are all small compared to meru.  i consider him the most integrated who, with his innermost self, has his mind fixed on me, on account of my being the only object of his overflowing love and also on account of his having a nature which cannot be supported by anything other than myself , who has 'faith,' i.e., who strives rapidly to attain me because of his being unable to bear a moment's separation from me on account of my being very dear to him , and who 'worships me,' i.e., serves me with devotion and meditates on me - me whose sportive delight brings about the origination, sustentation and dissolution of the entire cosmos filled with multifarious and innumerable objects of enjoyment, enjoyers, means and places of enjoyment , who is untouched by any evil without exception , whose divine figure is the treasue-house of innumerable multitudes of auspicious, unlimited and unsurpassed attributes such as knowledge, power, lordship, energy, potency and splendour , whose divine figure is the treasure-house of infinite, unsurpassed attributes agreeable and highly worthy, such as radiance, beauty, fragrance, tenderness, pervading sweetness and youthfulness which are uniform, inconceivable and divine, wondrous, eternal and flawless , whose essential nature and alities transcend all thought and words , who is the great ocean of compassion, condescension, paternal love and beauty , who is the impartial refuge of all beings without exception and without considerations of any difference , who is the reliever of the distress of supplicants , who is the great, unfathomable ocean of affection for supplicants , who has become visible to the eyes of all men without abandoning his essential nature , who has incarnated in the house of vasudeva , who has made the entire would illumined with his limitless and excellent glory , and who has satisfied the entire universe with the impeccable glory of beauty.  the idea is that i, who by myself alone see all things directly as they are, look upon him, the last mentioned type of yogi here, as superior to all other types mentioned earlier",
  "yoginam etc.  he, who establishes me in his internal organ , who is totally addicted to devotion and faith and who serves i.e., internally experiences me alone, and not anything else,  following the method of tradition, learnt by rendering service to the revered teachers-he alone among all the yogins, is the best master of the yoga  i.e.,  one who is fully absorbed in the supreme lord.  thus the superiority of the yoga with godly knowledge over all [other means] has been explained",
  "api, even , sarvesam yoginam, among all the yogis, among those who are immersed in meditation on rudra, aditya, and others , yah, he who , bhajate, adores , mam, me , antaratmana,with his mind , madgatena, fixed on me, concentrated on me who am vasudeva , and sraddhavan, with faith, becoming filled with faith , sah, he , is matah, considered , me, by me , to be yukta-tamah, the best of the yogis, engaged in yoga most intensely. [it has been shown thus far that karma-yoga has monasticism as its ultimate culmination. and in the course of expounding dhyana-yoga together with its ausxiliaries, and instructing about the means to control the mind, the lord rules out the possibility of absolute ruin for a person fallen from yoga. he has also stated that steadfastness in knowledge is for a man who knows the meaning of the word tvam (thou) (in 'thou are that'). all these instructions amount to declaring that liberation comes from the knowledge of the great upanisadic saying, 'thou art that.']",

  "let him seek liberation by the help of his highest self, and let him never disgrace his own self. for that self is his only friend , yet it may also be his enemy",
  "let a person lift the self by self and let him not depress the self.  for, the self alone is the friend of the self and self alone is the foe of the self",

'for the self alone,' i.e., the mind alone is the friend of the self , and it alone is the foe of the self. [the figure of speech here is of samsara as the ocean in which the individual self is like an object with liability to sink. what causes its sinking is the lingering attachments of the mind to some objects, though in the discipline of jnana yoga one may keep aloof from such objects. a mind with such attachments is the foe and without them, the friend.]",

  "of him, by whom has been conered his very self by the self, his self is the friend of his self. but, for one who has not conered his self, his self itself acts inimically like an enemy",
  "a person whose mind is conered by himself in relation to sense-objects, has that mind as his friend. in the case of one whose mind is not conered in this way, his own mind, like an enemy, remains hostile. the meaning is that it acts, against his attainment of supreme beatitude. it has been stated by bhagavan parasara also:  'the mind of man is the cause both of his bondage and his release. its addiction to sense objects is the cause of his bondage , its separation from sense objects is the means of one's release' (v. p., 6.7.28).  the proper condition for the beginning of yoga is now taught:",
  " uddharet etc. bandhuh etc.  in this  [path] there is no other means excepting the self  i.e. nothing but one's mind.  indeed the subdued mind is a friend and it lifts up  [the self] from the highly dreadful  cycle of  birth  and death.  but the unsubdued one does the act of enmity as it throws  [the self] down in the horrible hell.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  the characteristic mark of the subdued-minded man is this :",

  "(a) this maya of mine consists of the three gunas, sattva, rajas and tamas. because it is created by me, the divine, for purpose of sport, it is divine in its power and therefore difficult to overcome.  the word maya is used for the effects of the three gunas, because it has got the power of generating wonderful effects as in the case of the magic of asuras and raksasas. see the passages:  'then the excellent discus, the flaming sudarsana, was despatched by the lord to defend the boy. the thousand mayas or wonderfully created weapons of the evil-designed sambara were foiled one after another, by that ickly moving discus, for protecting the body of the boy' (v. p., 1.19. 19-20).  here the term maya does not signify the sense of 'false'. even with regard to magicians, when the term, mayavin (one who possesses maya) is used, there is origination of real impressions with the aid of certain incantations, herbs etc., though the objects created are illusory things. accordingly the term maya denotes the incantations, herbs etc., which have got the power of creating real impressions. inasmuch as the sense of the term should be invariable, following the usage in all cases, the term maya can be applied to the illusory objects, only in a secondary sense, while its primary sense in regard to the real impressions generated in the mind. it is just like in the statement 'the cots cry.'  the maya of the lord, which is absolutely real and which consists of the gunas, is alone taught in the texts like, 'know then maya to be the prakrti and the possessor of the maya to be the great lord' (sve. u., 4.10). it not only obscures the essential nature of the lord but also creates the condition of the mind that sees its objects as enjoyable. therefore, the entire universe, deluded by the lord's maya, does not know the lord who is of the nature of boundless beatitude. (on the other hand they feel objects set forth by maya as enjoyable).  sri krsna teaches the way of deliverance from maya:  (b) but those who take refuge in me alone - me whose resolves are always true, who has supreme compassion, and who is the refuge of all beings without exception and without consideration of their particular status - such persons shall pass beyond this maya of mine consisting of the three gunas. the meaning is that they worship me alone, renouncing the maya.  why, then do all not take recourse to refuge in the lord which is conducive to the worship of the lord?",
  "daivi  etc.  deva  means  'one who plays'.  what is born of  (or exists in)  him is daivi  'play'.  hence, the meaning is :  'this is my play'.  due to this [play-trick],  the  [strands]  sattva etc.,  even though they are not really different  from the supreme brahman,  the pure consciousness, manifest as different  from that.  this  [differentiation] itself  accounts for their  secondary nature i.e.,  the nature of being an object of enjoyment i.e.,  being dependent on the existence of the enjoyer. this peculiarity of dual-nature is inexplicable for the persons of mundane life.  hence to them it is a trick-of-illusion. therefore, those who have realised the light of the brahman,  the supreme reality, and find the universe as not distinct from that  [brahman],  they  [alone]  cross over the trick-off-illusion which is of the nature of manifesting in duality and is in the form of the dependent  status of the strands,  sattva etc.  this is the idea indicated by  'alone'  in  'me alone'.  on the other hand those who would find just the manifestation of duality as they  [appear to]  exist - they do not across over the trick-of-illusion.  thus it is rightly said  'i am not in them (in the beings of the sattva etc.)  etc.'",

(i)  the 'distressed' is one who has lost his position in life and his wealth, and who wishes to regain them (ii) he who 'aspires for wealth' is one who desires for wealth which he has not till then attained. between them the difference is very little, as both of them seek wealth. (iii) he 'who seeks after knowledge' is one who wishes to realise the real nature of the self (in its pure state) as an entity different from the prakrti. he is called 'one who seeks to secure knowledge,' because knowledge alone is the essential nature of the self. (iv) and the 'man of knowledge' is he who knows that, it is the essential nature of the self to find happiness only as the sesa (subsidiary or liege) of the lord, as taught in the text beginning with, 'but know that which is other than this (lower nature) to be the higher prakrti' (7.5). without stopping with the knowledge of the self as different from the prakrti, he desires to attain the lord. he thinks that the lord alone is the highest aim to reach",
  "again, o arjuna, foremost of the bharata dynasty, caturvidhah, four classes , of janah, people , who are eminent among human beings and are pious in actions, and are sukrtinah, of virtuous deeds , bhajante, adore , mam, me , artah, the afflicted-one who is overcome by sorrow, who is in distress, ['one who, being in distress and seeking to be saved from it, takes refuge (in me).'] being over-whelmed by thieves, tigers, disease, etc. , jijnasuh, the seeker of knowledge, who wants to know the reality of the lord , artharthi, the seeker of wealth , and jnani, the man of knowledge, [i.e. one who, already having intellectual knowledge, aspires for liberation.] who knows the reality of visnu",
  "of them the wise, ever steadfast and devoted to the one, excels (is the best) , for i am exceedingly dear to the wise and he is dear to me",
  "of all of these, he who has gained wisdom, who meditates on me without ceasing, devoting himself only to me, he is the best , for by the wise man i am exceedingly beloved and the wise man, too, is beloved by me",
  "of them, the man of wisdom, being always attached [to me] with single-pointed devotion excels [others].  for, i am dear to the man of wisdom above all personal gains and he is dear to me",
  "of these, the man of knowledge, being ever with me in yoga and devoted to the one only, is the foremost , for i am very dear to the man of knowledge and he too is dear to me",
  "of them, the man of knowledge, endowed with constant steadfastness and one-pointed devotion, excels. for i am very much dear to the man of knowledge, and he too is dear to me",
  "of these four, 'the man of knowledge' is the foremost. why?  because of being ever with me in yoga and devoted to the one only. to the man of knowledge the attainment of myself being the only end in view, he is ever with me. as for the others, they contemplate on me only until the fulfilment of their desires. but to the man of knowledge, there is single-minded devotion to me only. unlike him, the others, want only the objects of their desire and they are devoted to me only as a means for gaining them. hence he, the man of knowledge, alone is the foremost. further i am very dear to the man of knowledge. here the term 'artha' in relation to the expression 'athyartham' denotes 'what cannot be expressed adeately.' that is, even i, the omniscient and omnipotent, is unable to express how much i am dear to the jnanin, since there is no such limit as 'this much' for this love. such is the meaning. as in the case of prahlada, the foremost among men of knowledge, it is said:  'but he with his thoughts firmly fixed on krsna while being bitten by the great serpents, felt no pain from the wounds, being immersed in rapturous recollections of him' (v. p., 1.17.39). i reciprocate this love infinitely",
  "tesam, of them, among the four , jnani, the man of knowledge, the knower of reality, is nitya-yuktah, endowed with constant steadfastness as a result of being a knower of reality , and he also becomes eka-bhaktih, endowed with one-pointed devotion, because he finds no one else whom he can adore. conseently, that person of one-pointed devotion visisyate, excels, becomes superior, i.e. he surpasses (the others). hi, since , i, the self, am priyah, dear , jnaninah, to the man of knowledge , therefore aham, i , am atyartham, very much , priyah, dear to him. it is indeed a well known fact in the world that the self is dear. the meaning, therefore, is that vasudeva, being the self of the man of knowledge, is dear to him. and sah, he, the man of knowledge, being the very self of me who am vasudeva , is very much priyah, dear , mama, to me. 'if that be so, then the other three-the afflicted and the others-are not dear to vasudeva?' 'this is not so!' 'what then?'",
  "noble indeed are all these , but i deem the wise man as my very self , for, steadfast in mind he is established in me alone as the supreme goal",
  "noble-minded are they all, but the wise man i hold as my own self , for he, remaining always at peace with me, makes me his final goal",
  "all these are noble persons, indeed.  but the man of wisdom is considered as the very soul of  [mine].  for, with his self (mind)  that has mastered the yoga, he has resorted to nothing but me as his most supreme goal",
  "all these are indeed generous (udarah), but i deem the man of knowledge to be my very self , for he, integrated, is devoted to me alone as the highest end",
  "all of these, indeed, are noble, but the man of knowledge is the very self. (this is) my opinion. for, with a steadfast mind, he is set on the path leading to me alone who am the super-excellent goal",
  "because they worship me alone, all these are generous i.e., benefactors. for, those who receive from me anything, however small they are, i consider them as contributing everything to me (and thus as benefactors). but i deem the man of knowledge to be my very self. i consider myself as depending on him for my support. why is it so?  because this person considers me to be the highest and finds it impossible to support himself without me , i also find it impossible to be without him. thus, verily, he is my self.  the attainment of this state of mind reires innumerable auspicious births. it is attained after gaining the knowledge of the real nature of the self and the self feels that its happiness consists in being a dependant (sesa) of myself",
  "sarve, ete, all of these three, without exception , are eva, indeed, udarah, noble, i.e. , they are verily dear to me. for, no devotee of mine can become disagreeable to me who am vasudeva. but the man of knowledge becomes very much dear. this is the difference. why is this so? in answer the lord says: tu but , jnani, the man of knowledge , is atma eva, the very self, not different from me. this is me, my , matam, opinion, conviction. hi, for , yuktatma, with a steadfast mind-having his mind absorbed in the idea, 'i am verily vasudeva, the lord, and none else', that man of knowledge asthitah, is set on the path leading to, he is engaged in ascending to, going to , mam eva, me alone, to the supreme brahman , who am the anuttamam gatim, super-excellent goal to be reached. the man of knowledge is being eulogized again:",
  "at the end of many births the wise man comes to me, realising that all this is vaasudeva (the innermost self) , such a great soul (mahatma) is very hard to find",
  "after many lives, at last the wise man realises me as i am. a man so enlightened that he sees god everywhere is very difficult to find",
  "at the end of many births, one attains me with the conviction that 'all is vasudeva' - that noble soul is very difficult to get",
  "at the end of many births, the man of knowledge finds refuge in me, realising that 'vasudeva is all.' it is very hard to find such a great-souled person",
  "at the end of many births the man of knowledge attains me, (realizing) that vasudeva is all. such a high-souled one is very rare",
  "further after passing through innumerable auspicious births, one gets the knowledge:  'i find my sole joy as a sesa of vasudeva. i find my essence, existence and activities to be dependent on him. he is superior over all others on account of his innumerable auspicious attributes.' conseent to this knowledge he resorts to me, i.e., meditates on me, realising, 'vasudeva alone is my highest end and also the means for attaining it, and whatever other desire remains in the mind, he alone is all that too for me'. such a great-souled person, i.e., great-minded man is hard to find. it is very hard to find such persons in this world. this is the only meaning of the statement that 'vasudeva is all,' because of the topic having been begun with the statements:  'for i am very dear to the man of knowledge' (7.17) and 'for he, integrated, is devoted to me alone as the highest end' (7.18). it is so, also because that jnanin whose traits are given here, possesses the same alities as the man of knowledge described earlier.  for, it has been said that the two prakrtis, the animate and the inanimate, have their sole essence in being the sesa (dependants) of the supreme person in the verses beginning with 'earth, water' (7.4) and ending with, 'ego-sense, thus my prakrti is divided eightfold. this is my lower (prakrti). but know that which is other than this (lower nature) and forms the life-principle to be the higher prakrti' (7.4-5). then take the beginning from 'i am the origin and dissolution of the whole universe. there is nothing higher than myself, o arjuna' (7.6-7), and ending with, 'know that all the states of sattva, rajas and tamas are from me alone. but i am not in them. they are in me' (7.12). it has been declared in these texts that the two prakrtis, both in their states of cause and effect, depend upon him for their essence, existence and activities and that the supreme person is superior to everything in all respects. therefore the knower of this truth alone is here spoken of as a man of knowledge or as one knowing 'all this is vasudeva.' [the purpose of this explanation is to eliminate any pure monistic slant to this passage.]  sri krsna now explains the rarity of finding such a person of knowledge",
  " caturvidhah  etc.,  upto  sudurlabhah.  those  who  worship me are men of good action.  they are of four types.  all these are noble ones.  for, other persons,  mean-minded as they are,  beg a cure of  their  affliction, and money etc., from persons who have hands, feet, stomach, body and intelligence  (or bodily strength)  that are eal to their  (the beggers)  own, or even from those who are very much inferior.  but, by comparison with the man of wisdom,  [the other three under estion]  are of inferior intelligence.  for, they entertain, at that sage too, a sense of duality.  becuase, a sense of duality  'i  seek this from the bhagavat'  is clearly  discernible in them.  on the other hand,  the man of  wisdom hangs on me alone with a sense of identity  [of him with me].  hence, i am verily  indentical with him.  it is i alone, and not [any other] gain,  that is dear to him.  that is why he is having a mind purified by the firm conviction  'all is nothing but vasudeva'",

  "iccha-etc.  [at the time of destruction]  he  (the personal soul)  is led to expand  exceedingly,  while he still remains  unconcious  on account of his desire, aversion,  agner,  dellusion etc.  on account  of  this,  the entire world  takes recourse to the sleeping stage while it continues to  exist in its entirity within the  stomach of the prakrti  (the prime casue) , and to exist just being (temporarily)  not  capable of performing its activities.  for, as long as  there is delusion,  the mental impressions are to be experienced, as in the case of the sleeping stage in the night time every day.  but on that account no emancipation is gained.  for, when the experience of  loss  of  unconsciousness is over  (i.e., when consciousness is regained),  again the mundane life with its varieties of activites  is found",
  "iccha-dvesa-samutthena, by what arises from likes and dislikes: iccha, likes, and dvesa, dislikes, are iccha-dvesau , anything arising from them is icchadvesa-samutthah. (creatures are duluded) by that. by what? when that is thus sought to be known in particular, the lord answers: dvandva-mohena, by the delusion of duality. delusion (moha) that originates from duality (advandva) is dvandva-moha. those very likes and dislikes, which are mutually opposed like heat and cold, which relate to happiness and sorrow and their causes, and which come into association with all beings in due course, are termed as duality (and this deludes all creatures). as regards them, when likes and dislikes arise from the experience of happiness, sorrow and their causes, then, by bringing the wisdom of all beings under their control, they create bewilderment which is the cause of the impediment to the rise of knowledg about the reality of self, the suprem truth. indeed, exact knowledg about objects even in the external world does not arise in one whose mind is overpowered by the defects, viz likes and dislikes. it goes without saying that knowledge of the indwelling self, beset with many obstacles as it is, does not arise in a completely bewildered person whose intelligence has been overcome by them. therefore, bharata, o scion of the bharata dynasty , owing to that delusion of duality arising from likes and dislikes, sarvabhutani, all creatures become deluded. parantapa, o destroyer of foes , they yanti sammoham, become bewildered, come under delusion , sarge, at the time of their birth, i.e. at the time of their origination. the idea is that all creatures that come into being do so prepossessed by delusion. 'since this is so, therefore all creatures, being deluded and having their wisdom obstructed by that delusion of duality, do not know me who am their self. hence, they do not adore me as their self.' 'who, again, are those that, becoming free from the delusion of duality, come to know you, and adore you as the self in accordance with the scriptures?' in order to elaborate the subject enired about, it is being said:",

  "a brhma etc.  [this verse]  has been interpreted by all as  'there is rirth even for those who have reached the world of brhma  (the personal god).'  if this interpretation is accepted, then it would amount to the  proposition  that going to the  worlds that are higher than that  [of brahma],  is emancipation  [from  rirth].  however according to us,  with  our inner sight blurred by the powerful darkness of doubt, this interpretation does not seem to touch the heart  [of the text].  hence, the following  is the wick of the lamp brought from the agama literature :  till  brahman :  till the status of the supreme  brahman is attained.  till then all are subject to return  (to rirth)  from each and every world, whether it lies adjacently, or above or below  [the world of brahman] ,  men run round like a wheel  wandering without stop from one place to another.\t\t\t  but who knows in this manner viz.,  'from all the world there is return' ?  for, it is heard [in the puranas]  that [the personal gods like]  brahma etc., themselves exist indeed for a very  long period.  how is it  that they too are subject to return again ?  if they are subject to return, will they not be of the nature of having birth and death ?  expecting this objection,  [the lord] says :",

'those who are in the forest worship by means of faith and austerity etc.,' (cha. u., 5.10.1).   it is taught in the vidya (meditation) of five fires:  'thus, indeed, in the fifth oblation the waters become purusa' (cha. u., 5.9.1) and 'those with a balance of good karmas ৷৷. and those with a balance of bad karmas' (ibid., 5.10.7). what is to be understood here is that the state of existence as men and other beings, which has its origin in good and evil karmas, refer to the 'waters' which alone are mixed with other elements (i.e., to the body-mind) , as for the self, there is only contact with them and not identification. thus, is declared the difference between intelligent self and inanimate matter. then, by the texts, 'those who know this' (ibid., 5.10.1), 'those who go to the rays of light' (ibid.), and 'they who proceed by it return not to the human condition here,' it is instructed that those who know this concerning the sentient and inanimate entities - the one to be attained and the other to be rejected , they jourey along the path described by the terms 'beginning with light and do not return to samsara'. on account of the passage, 'he leads them to the brahman' (ibid., 4.15.5), which holds that the brahman is attained by both the knower of real nature of the self and the devotees of the supreme person and also because of the axiom of 'results according to efforts' (tat-kratu-nyaya), the entity self, separated from the inanimate matter, should be constantly meditated upon as having its sole joy in absolute subservience to the supreme brahman who is its self. the self's nature of finding only joy consists in absolute subservience to the surpeme person. this is proved from the srutis like 'he who dwells within the self ৷৷. whose body is the self' (sa. bra., 14.6.5.5.30)",
  "parah  etc.  upto pratisthitam.  the absolute  (vasudevatattva) of the above description is beyond the concept of  time manifest :  [because]  it is immanent in all beings.  in spite of being  so,  it is  unmanifest :  because  it is difficult  to attain.  that it is, however, attainable by means of devotion has also been made clear already.  in  this exists this universe which is  [its] perennial nature that remains always the same.   now,  what is the  meaning of the word, punah 'again'  and of the word avrtti 'returning' ?  this meaning certainly presupposes a conditon of disruption  of one's  own nature for sometime in the intervening period.  the auspicious  supreme  lord's real nature is his absolute freedom viz., the supreme consciousness that transcends  the universe, yet remains identical with the universe, and serves as the basis of the universe ,  and it is perennial.  hence, it cannot be assumed that there was some disruption at any time for this real nature and that the supreme lord regained that nature.  hence it is rightly said  'having  attained me' etc.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  so far the behaviour of those persons who attain the bhagavat by constant practice without much labour has been described.  now a difference that lies between  those who, by departing, will  (or attain)  emancipation and those who will enjoyment  [of mundane life],  is described :",

(br. 3.8.9). and (the letter) om is not accept here [as the meaning of aksara (lit. letter)], because of its being mentioned (as a letter) later on in, 'the single letter om, which is brahman' (13). besides, the adjective 'supreme' is more apporpriate with regard to the absolute, immutable brahman. by svabhava, self-hood, is meant the eixtence of that very supreme brahman in every body as the indwelling self. svabhavah ucyate, self-hood is said to be, is referred to by the word , adhyatmam, the entity which, as the indwelling self, exists in the body (atma) by making it its habitat (adhikrtya), and which in the ultimate analysis is the supreme brahman. visargah, the offerings, the giving away to gods of things like porridge [caru: an oblations of rice, barley and pulse boiled-together to be offered to gods.], cake, etc. , bhuta-bhava-udbhava-karah, which bring about the origin of the existence of things , is karma-sanjnitah, meant by action. this sacrifice consisting in pouring of oblations is called action. the existence (bhava) of (moving and nonmoving) things (bhuta) is bhuta-bhava. the coming into being (udbhava) of that (existence) is bhuta-bhava-udbhavah. that which causes (karoti) this is bhuta-bhava-udbhava-karah, i.e. the originator of existing things. it is needed from this source that all bengs, moving and non-moving, originate thorugh the successive processes of railfall etc. (see 3.14-15)",
  "the blessed lord said  the immutable is the supreme brahman , self-hood is said to the entity present in the individual plane. by action is meant the offerings which bring about the origin of the existence of things",
  "the lord said  that which is the supreme imperishable (aksara) has been named 'that brahman' the aksara is that which cannot be destroyed and forms the totality of all individual selves. the srutis say to this effect:  'the avyakta is dissolved into the aksara, the aksara is dissolved into tamas' (su. u., 2). the supreme aksara is the essential form of the self, separated from prakrti. one's own material nature (the body) is spoken of as adhyatma or that which dwells with the self. this material nature (svabhava) is prakrti. it does not form the self but attaches itself to the self in the form of subtle elements, impressions etc. this has been taught in the vidya of five fires (cha. u., 5). both these (the aksara and the adhyatma) should be known by the aspirants for liberation (kaivalya) - the former as what should be attained and the latter as what should be relinished.  karma is that force which produces the origination of mundane beings. 'beings' here means beings such as the human beings. the creative force which produces their origination is contact with woman. it has been described in the sruti passage thus:  'the waters sacrificed in the fifth oblations become those who are named purusas' (cha. u., 5.3.3). that creative force is called karma. all the acts associated with that should be considered by aspirants after release as calling for abstention. this abstention will also be inculcated immediately in the text, 'desiring which they practise the vow of continence' (8.11)",
  "aksaram etc.  the supreme is  [called]  brahman because it is big and causes everything to grow  [in it].  on the same ground, what is  termed  'as the  lord-of-self'  is that thing which bears the name  consciousness which never ceases to be in it  (brahman)  and which is nothing but the brahman  (svah bhavah).  this  brahman,  which is nothing but consciousness, embraces the power of  [creating] the universe because of its unlimited aspect of being  external ,  and on account of  its freedom in the form of supremacy there arises the emitting  (i.e. creative)  activity [in it]  in the form of manifesting itself as the external inanimate beings and also as various external animate ones.  [these two aspects of]  this activity cause respectively the birth of  the inanimate beings - i.e. the insentient beings, and the animate ones i.e. the sentient beings like brahman etc.  [in other words],  it manifests as varigated  insentient and sentient beings.   again this activity bestows on what is real, its intrinsic nature i.e.  creates a reality for the one from which all that is false is excluded.  this emitting activity is what is known as  'action'",
  "aksaram means that which does not perish (na ksarati), the supreme self. this agrees with the upanisadic text, 'under the mighty rule of this immutable, o gargi৷৷.' (br. 3.8.9). and (the letter) om is not accept here [as the meaning of aksara (lit. letter)], because of its being mentioned (as a letter) later on in, 'the single letter om, which is brahman' (13). besides, the adjective 'supreme' is more apporpriate with regard to the absolute, immutable brahman. by svabhava, self-hood, is meant the eixtence of that very supreme brahman in every body as the indwelling self. svabhavah ucyate, self-hood is said to be, is referred to by the word , adhyatmam, the entity which, as the indwelling self, exists in the body (atma) by making it its habitat (adhikrtya), and which in the ultimate analysis is the supreme brahman. visargah, the offerings, the giving away to gods of things like porridge [caru: an oblations of rice, barley and pulse boiled-together to be offered to gods.], cake, etc. , bhuta-bhava-udbhava-karah, which bring about the origin of the existence of things , is karma-sanjnitah, meant by action. this sacrifice consisting in pouring of oblations is called action. the existence (bhava) of (moving and nonmoving) things (bhuta) is bhuta-bhava. the coming into being (udbhava) of that (existence) is bhuta-bhava-udbhavah. that which causes (karoti) this is bhuta-bhava-udbhava-karah, i.e. the originator of existing things. it is needed from this source that all bengs, moving and non-moving, originate thorugh the successive processes of railfall etc. (see 3.14-15)",

  " antakale etc.,  upto asamsayam.  at the time of departure also :  i.e., not only as longs as  [one is] in the healthy and unmolested condition.  me alone :  me, with all  attributes undistinguished. but at  the  time of  unhealthy state  (at the time of  death) of a person, how cloud the bhagavat enter the path of his memory, when all the activities of the senses of that person have totally ended ?  hence  [to achieve this result the lord]  teaches also the means or device by  'therefore' etc.:  the bhagavat  surely, on his own accord, becomes  [even at the time of death] the object of memory of that person from whose heart (mind) the bhagavat has never gone away in any cirucumstance connected with the mundane life also ,  who has [thus]  renounced all his actions to the bhagavat alone , and who is full of  (fully absorbed in) the bhagavat.  for this end, the means is to remain constantly absorbed in the thought of the bhagavat.  that is why  he says : 'with whatever object the internal organ of a person is filled up always, that object alone is remembered by him at the time of death, and the state of that being alone is attained [by him].  hence, let a person, by all means, have me alone as his goal and be desirous of attaining me'.  this is the idea here.   the idea  [intended here] is certainly not  'what is remembered, without fail, at the last moment that being alone is attained by him'.  because in that case the attainment of the man of wisdom would also be just like that of an ignorant man.  for, the former too  [at the time of death] gets  [complete] dulness of mind that is benumbed by the disorder  (or defect) of he elements existing in his entire body.  certainly it is not proper to accept this here.  for, it would go agains the authority of the scriptures.  for, the fact is-   'he who has attained liberation simultaneously with realisation  [of the self],  and whose sorrows [therefore] have been destroyed - he attains completely unity [with the absolute]  even though [at the time of death]  he has lost his memory and abandons his body in a sacred place or in the house of a dog-cooker  (i.e., man of a low tribe)'.  (ps, 83).   therefore the matter-of-fact statement  (or explanation) and injunction  [that are meant here]  are the following :   if a person's internal organ is absorbed incessantly in the thought of a particular being, the same being is attained by him at end after departure.  it is immaterial  whether  [at the time of departure]  that being is remembered or  not.  this  secondary importance  [of the remembrance] is indicated by the word api  'also'.  the word va  'or'  makes it clear that the rememberance does not exist in each  and every case.  the sage  (vyasa) himself clarifies his idea  'let a man always remain by all means  keeping me  (the absolute lord)  as  his  supreme  goal'.  since the sage says :  'therefore at all times keep me  (the absolute)  in your mind'.  therefore, the following is the combination of words [of the verse intended here] :   if a person, remembering always, or at the last moment - the use of or denotes  'or not remembering  [at the last moment]' - a particular  being, leaves his body, he attains that particular being alone.  for, he is always absorbed in the thought of that being.   but others  [interpret the verses as follows] :  when one leaves his body as the end, just at the moment of leaving the body i.e., at that moment which is not cognizable to the perceivers like relatives, sons etc.  [standing nearby] , at that moment  that comes last after the limb-movements, like  [heavy] breathing, exertion, hiccup, convulsive utterance etc.,  [have endred] , at that fraction of time when the bondage of pleasure, pain and bewilderment is weakened as a result of the weakening of the control of the bodily strength ,  at that time that goes by the term dehatyajana  'the moment of casting the body off' , at that moment whatsoever being a person remembers, his nature becomes entriely identical with that being, favoured  (taken as an object) by the first  consiousness. the cause for remembering  [the lord] at that moment is to remanin ever absorbed in the thought of him.  the word tyajati  [of verse 6] is to be construed as the seventh case  [meaning  'at the time of abandoning']. hence, the purport  [of the passage] is  only what has been said above.   what is the use of  such a remembrance of him at the  last moment ?  but, who told that  [there] is a use [for it] ?  but,  the remembrance  is certainly brought about as a natural course at the last moment.   but this [proposition] would lead to an undersirable conseence.  for, it has been observed that  a person  [usually] remberances at the last moment either the maintenance of his children, wife and  relatives, or drinking of cold water and so on.  so, he would become identical with those things.   it is not so.  the moment, you speak of, is not the last moment.  for, at that moment the existence of body is being clearly felt.  really that last moment, which we would like to speak of, can't be perceived by persons like you.  in what form alone the remembrance should be there at the last moment is decided by  [its cause], a  potential mental impression certainly arising at that time - even though it is far off - according to the general principle :   'the remembrance and the potential mental impression  [that causes it] being identical in form, there should be a seential  immediacy  [between them],  even though they are removed [from one another] by many births, by long distance and by long passage of time'.  (ys, iv, 9).   thus, depending on the potential mental impression, there arises remembrance of a particular being, and becuase of its remembrance one attains the identity of that being.   however in the case of certain body the same [process] is accidentally indicated even at the stage of healthy body-condition.  see for example, the remembrance of a deer etc.,  [both in the healthy conditions and in the dying moment] and the conseential attainment of the deerhood, as described  in the  puranic literature.  that is why api ca  'and also' is employed in [the statement] like  'and also at the time of journey.'  therefore, those who constantly think of the bhagavat with intention  'let us become this being' ,  they attain [in the following order] the identity with absolute lord, of the exclusive nature of  consciousness :  [first] there arises the thought  (smarana) of  the lord at the moment when the bodily existence is felt ,  then at that unperceivable last moment the potential mental impression, born of the said thought, gives rise to the remembrance of the lord by striking down all the other potential mental impressions, according to the principle :   'the potential mental impression, born therefrom , make all other potential mental impressions powerless   (ys., i, 50).   then only at the moment of the fall of the body, because at that time the mental impression created by  [the sense of] time has  come to an end and because the differences of the objects like  'this',  'that' etc., are not felt-at that moment he attains identity with the lord.  this much of discussion is enough.   without doubt  (verse 7) :  one should not entertain any doubt in this regard",
  "tasmat, therefore , anusmara, think of , mam, me, in the way prescribed by the scriptures , sarvesu kalesu, at all times , and yudhya, fight, engage your-self in war, which is your own (caste) duty. asamsayah, there is no doubt in this matter , that arpita-mano-buddhih, by dedicating your mind and intellect , mayi , to me , esyasi, you-you who have thus dedicated our mind and intellect to me, vasudeva-will attain , mam eva, me alone, as i shall be remembered.

  "this is a 'royal science', the king among sciences , 'the royal mystery', the king among mysteries. or royal science may also mean the science known and practised by kings. indeed kings are those who have broad and profound minds. the meaning is that this is the science of great minds. this is a mystery, because the great-minded alone are skilled in keeping mysteries. this is 'supreme purifier' , for it removes completely all blemishes opposed to the attainment of myself.  it is realised by 'direct perception'. avagama' is that which is apprehended - the subject of knowledge. it is that knowledge which has become direct perception, so that its object is directly apprehended. the import is that i, when worshipped in the spirit of bhakti, become perceptible to the worshipper immediately.  even so, it is in 'accord with dharma' or inseparable from dharma. what is called dharma is that which constitutes the means for the highest good. though it is of the nature of supreme good, as it brings about the vision of myself, yet it is also the means for completely attaining me, which is the end unsurpassed and the final good.  because of this, it is 'pleasurable' to practise , its adoption is a matter of supreme love. it is 'abiding', imperishable. it does not perish even after leading to my attainment. that is, i give myself up to one who performs this form of worship , even then it appears to me that i have done nothing for him. such is the meaning",

  " ye' pi etc. upto prayatatmanah.  even those who worship [gods] with other names, they too [in fact] worship me alone, becaue there is nothing  (no god) to be worshipped apart from the brahman.  but the  difference is that  [they do so] by non-injunction.  non-injunction : different injunctions.  [this amounts to saying that]  having the innate nature of the absolute brahman-existence,  i am indeed worshipped by manifold injunctions (i.e., sacrifices enjoined by injunctions).   but non-injunction should not be explained as  'by defective injunction'  as it has been done by others  (other commentators), who acire dirts of great sins by insulting other systems of philosophy.  if their view is correct then the declarations that are actually found viz.,  'they offer sacrifice to me alone',  and 'i am alone the enjoyer of all sacrifices' - all would be inconsistent.  enough of talk with the sinful ones.   our preceptors, however,  explain  [ye'pyanya-etc.] as follows :  those who,  following the principle of the doctrine of duality consider certain deity as different from their own self and as devoid of the innate nature of the brahman, and offer sacrifice to that deity only-but it is only to me, their own self that even those men offer their sacrifices, however by  non-injunction  i.e. by faulty injunction of the nature of duality-view.  that is why  [the lord] says  (in verse 25)  'they do not recognise me, their own self, correctly as that deity itself,  i.e.,  as the enjoyer  [of the oblation of the sacrifice].  hence they move away from my nature .  why ? by being votaries of gods, they attain the gods etc.  (verse 26).  it amounts to say that this [fact of attaining these gods] is itself nothing but moving away  [from me, the self].  on the other hand, those who realise my nature (i.e. me)  as  being not different  [from their  self],  they offer sacrifices to me alone, even though those sacrifices etc. are for the gods, goblins and manes.'  [the lord] is going to conclude  [the present topic] as :  '(thus)  offering sacrifice to me they attain me alone.'  (ix-29,35).   but that alone is called a deity which is aimed at [according to injunction],  for offering things  (i.e. oblation).  hence, how  can a sacrifice be offered to one's own self, a category  that cannot be aimed at ?  for example, there is the injunction:  'the oblation [of rice]  of the rite prayana, crooked in the milk, is intended for the deity aditi' ,  and hence this aditi becomes the object intended  [in the sacrifice], because that particular deity is an adjunct of an injunction, and because it is included in the injunction as one to be aimed at.  but [in the present case],  there is no injunction that concerns the self. having  [these objections] in mind  [the lord] says :  [they offer sacrifice] to me following non-injunction.   the idea is this :  an injunction is reired only in the case of a deity that is different from one's own self.  for, the injunction is one of the nature of imparting the knowledge only of that particular thing which is not known  [otherwise].  but, one's own  self, the absolute lord, is known, not following any injunction.  for, the knowledge of the self is not brought by injunction.  certainly no action is undertaken not  aiming the  self.  therefore in all cases  [of offerings], intended for the deities like indra etc., this self of one's own is certainly intended , as the self is, by nature, the illuminator of the entire universe ,  as it is like a thread in a garland , and as it is   illumining  [on its own accord],  asserting its superiority  [over all others] and  only serving as a background (bhittih, 'a screen', or  'a wall') of the manifestations of the deity so intended by  him  [in the sacrifice].  thus it is established by logic that even the votaries of gods offer sacrifices to me  (the absolute)  alone, becuase  'i'  depends on no injunction.   as far as these sacrificers are concerned, the principal effect of the sacrifice viz., attaining  'me', is not intended by them as their own.  on the other hand, they are very much satisfied with attaining the status of indra etc., just as a priest  is satisfied with limited fees.  to indicate this, the parasmaipada  form  (yajanti)  [is used].  for, it has been stated by myself  (ag.)  [else-where] as :   'one, who knows the vedas and does not know  [to intend for]  the status of  (or the word)  sambhu  (the absolute), would feel afflicted in despair.  [for], aspiring for the heaven, and [hence]  rejecting the status of  [the actual]  performer of of sacrifice  (yajamana),  [but at the same time]  performing sacrifice for others  (yajan),  he has become a  [mere]  priest in the sacrifice.  indeed, the divergently flowing floods of taste for action,  without exception, - even though they flow from the absolute consciousness - do not bestow  [on the performer]  the mighty ocean of bliss of one's own self if they do not gain a complete  stability'   thus whosoever realises in the said manner, his sacrifice,  though aimed at the deities like indra, is in fact a sacrifice offered to the absolute lord.\t\t  whatever may be the other actions of  his, they too become acts of worshipping his own self, the absolute lord, as it alone is intended in all his action.  this  [the lord] says :",

  "even if a man of very bad conduct worships me with one-pointed devotion, he is to be considered verily good , for he has resolved rightly",
  "even though he has transgressed rules that ought to be followed and has failed to avoid what a person belonging to a particular class should avoid, if he has begun to worship me in the manner described above with undivided devotion, namely, with worship as the only purpose - such a person must be considered highly righteous. he is eminent among the worshippers of visnu. he must be esteemed as fit for honour. the meaning is that he is eal to those jnanins mentioned earlier. what can be the reason for this?  the reason is that, he has rightly resolved, i.e., his resolve is in the proper direction. 'the lord who forms the sole cause of the entire universe, who is the supreme brahman, narayana, the lord of all mobile and immobile beings, is our master, our teacher, and our friend, highest object of enjoyment,' - such a resolve is difficult to be made by all. its effect, unremitting worship which has no other purpose, will be found in him who makes such a resolve. hence he is holy and is to be highly honoured. when this resolve, and unremitting worship which is its effect, are found in a person, he is not to be belittled , for, his transgression of rules is a negligible mistake compared to this kind of excellence. on the other hand he is to be regarded with high honour. such is the meaning.  no, if it be said that transgression of rules will annul the flow of worship, as declared in the sruti passages like, 'one who has not ceased from bad conduct, is not tranil, is not composed and also not calm in mind, cannot obtain him through intelligence' (ka. u., 1.2.24), sri krsna replies:",

  "  man hi  etc , upto  matparayanah.   those who are of sinful birth : i.e., the animals, birds, reptiles etc.  women denotes the ignorant.  men of working class denotes those who find pleasure in different vocations, like agriculture etc.   men of the fourth caste :  those who do not have any claim whatsoever for [performing]  the vedic rituals  and whose livelihood depend on others.  by taking refuge [solely] in me, even these all attain me alone.  the deeds of the exceedingly compassionate bhagavat, like the one granting liberation to a chief of the elephants are heard in thousands [in the puranas].  certainly it must be so, for those whose  behaviour is just the opposite to that of these persons.   some (commentators]  declare : the present sentence [of the lord]  intends  to glorify the twice-born and members of the ruling class, and it is not uttered with the intention of speaking of the attainment of liberation in the case of the women etc.   indeed these persons [aim to]  break into pieces the graceous-to-all  power of the bhagavat by foistering upon it, a limited applicability ,  likwise they do not tolerate the profoundly compassionate nature of the absolute lord ,  they contradict the [lord's own]  statements  'to me none is hateful and none is dear (ix, 30)',  'even a highly evil-doer etc.  (ix, 31)',  and other similar statements, very clearly of the same import , with all effort they  [strive to]  bring in something indicative of duality even in the absolute-being,  whose non-dual nature has been well established firmly by the diversity of the best reasonings ,  they are not mindful of other contradictions  [that lurk in their theory]  with the revealed literature ,  when simply estioned  'how is this ?'  and  'how is that ?',  these persons, having their internal organ totally possessed by the mighty devil of the caste  [considerations],  concealed within, and having their tongue, face and eyes all twisted by their sense of  jealously, hypocrisy and shame-they prattle evil for the entire humanity ,  and thus they put upon themselves the status of being an object of  ridicule.  therefore the above explanation  [of ours]  does good to all",

  "this 'entire universe,' composed to sentient and non-sentient beings, is pervaded by me, the inner controller, whose 'form is not manifest,' namely, whose essential nature is unmanifest. the meaning is that all this is pervaded by me, the principal (sesi), so that i may sustain and rule this universe. this, the pervasion of all by the inner controller, who is invisible to the entire group of sentient and non-sentient beings, is taught in the following passage of the antaryami-brahmana:  'he who dwells in the earth ৷৷. whom the earth 'does not know' (br. u., 3.7.3) and 'he who dwells in the self ৷৷. whom the self does not know etc.,' (br. u. madh., 3.7.22). therefore 'all beings abide in me' , all beings rest in me who am their inner controller. in the same brahmana it is taught that their existence and control are dependent on him, as they are subject to his control and as they constitute his body:  'he whose body is the earth ৷৷. who controls the earth from within' (br. u., 3.7.3) and 'he whose body is the self ৷৷. he who controls the self from within' (br. u. madh., 3.7.22). so also his primacy over everything is taught. 'i am not in them,' namely, i do not 'depend' on them for my existence. there is no help derived from them for my existence",
  "maya etc.  all beings exist in me :  because no other abode of  rest is available, even if one wanders [in search of it] for long.  the beings  (or elements)  that form the objects of knowledge possess their well-known nature of insentiency.  when these beings manifest with this nature foremost, their other innate nature viz.,  sentiency, that is opposed to this [former nature], remain hidden.  this is what he says by i do not exist in them",

'i am the upholder of all beings and yet i am not in them - my will sustains all beings.' the meaning is i am the supporter of all beings, and yet i derive no help for myself whatever from them. my will alone projects, sustains and controls all beings.  he gives an illustration to show how all beings depend on his will for their being and acts:",
  "na ca etc. yet, the beings do not exist in me :  for, the persons, who are blind with nescience, do not see the reality.  the ignorant  do not consider the absolute lord - who is of the nature of infinite  consciousness - as a basis of determinate knowledge of all objects.  on the other hand conceiving  [like] 'i, the lean devadatta,  know this, as existing here on the floor',  they view  [things of]  finite nature aone as the basis  [of determination].   but why this contradiction ?  on this doubt  [the lord] says  look at the sovereign yoga of mine.  yoga signifies the  power  [of the absolute],  because it is being employed.  this is indeed my sovereignty,  which is the freedom of behaving in this manner in a highly strange way.  this is the idea  (here)",
  "na ca bhutani, nor do the beings, beginning from brahma , matsthani, dwell in me. pasya, behold , me, my , aisvaram, divine , yogam, yoga, action, performance, i.e. this real nature of myself. the upanisadic text, too, similarly shows the absence of association (of the self) due to its being free from contact: '৷৷.unattached, for it is never attached' (br. 3.9.26). behold this other wonder: i am the bhuta-bhrt, sustainer of beings, though i am unattached. ca, but , mama atma, my self , na bhutasthah, is not contained in the bengs. as it has been explained according to the logic stated above, there is no possibility of its remaining contained in beings. how, again, is it said, 'it is my self? following human understanding, having separated the aggregate of body etc. (from the self) and superimposing eoism of them, the lord calls it 'my self'. but not that he has said so by ignorantly thinking like ordinary mortals that the self is different from himself. so also, i am the bhuta-bhavanah, originator of beings, one who gives birth to or nourishes the beings. by way of establishing with the help of an illustration the subject-matter [subject-matter-that the self, which has no contact with anything, is the substratum of creation, continuance and dissolution.] dealt with in the aforesaid two verses, the lord says:",
  "as the mighty wind, moving everywhere, rests always in the ether, even so, know thou that all beings rest in me",
  "as the mighty wind, though moving everywhere, has no resting place but space, so have all these beings no home but me",
  "just as the mighty wind exists in the ether, always moving [in it] everywhere, in the same manner all beings exist in me.  be sure of it",
  "as the powerful element air moving everywhere ever remains in the ether, know that so too all beings abide in me",
  "understand thus that just as the voluminous wind moving everywhere is ever present in space, similarly all beings abide in me",
  "the 'powerful air' remains and moves everywhere in the ether (akasa) without any perceivable support. so it has necessarily got to be admitted that the powerful air is dependent on me for its existence and is being upheld by me alone. even so know that all entities abide in me, who am invisible to them, and that they are upheld by me alone. the knowers of the veda declare thus:  'the origin of clouds, the waters of the ocean remaining within bounds, the phases of the moon, the strong movements of the gale, the flash of lightning and the movements of the sun - all these are marvellous manifestations of the power of visnu.' the meaning is that they are all the marvellous miracles which are unie to visnu. the srutis and other texts also declare likewise:  'verily, o gargi, at the ?nd of that imperishable one, the sun and the moon stand apart' (br. u., 3.8.9, and 'through the fear of him the wind blows, through the fear of him the sun rises, through the fear of him agni and indra perform their duties' (tai. u., 2.8.1).  it has been declared that the existence and acts of all beings originate by the will of the lord, who is independent of all others. now sri krsna declares that the origin and dissolution of all entities also are due to his will only:",

  "upadharaya, understand , iti, thus , that yatha, just as , in the world, the mahan, voluminous-in dimension , vayuh, wind , sarvatragah, moving everywhere , is nityam, ever , [during creation, continuance and dissolution] akasa-sthitah, present in space , tatha, similarly , (sarvani, all , bhutani, beings , matsthani,) abide in me who am omnipresent like space-abide certainly without any contact",
  "all beings, o arjuna, go into my nature at the end of a kalpa , i send them forth again at the beginning of (the next) kalpa",
  "all beings, o arjuna, return at the close of every cosmic cycle into the realm of nature, which is a part of me, and at the beginning of the next i send them forth again",
  "o son of kunti, all beings pass into the nature [of mine] at the end of the kalpa (the age of universe) , i send them forth again at the beginning of the [next] kalpa",
  "all beings, o arjuna, enter into my prakrti at the end of a cycle of time. again i send these forth at the beginning of a cycle of time",
  "o son kunti, all the beings go back at the end of a cycle to my prakrti. i project them forth again at the beginning of a cycle",
  "all the mobile and immobile entities enter into my prakrti at the end of a cycle, namely at the end of brahma's life in accordance with my will. this prakrti, constituting my body, is designated by the term tamas, as it cannot be differentiated into name and form. i again send forth the very same beings at the beginning of a cycle. manu declares accordingly:  'this universe became tamas ৷৷. by an act of will. he produced it out of his body' (manu, 1.5.8). the srutis also declare thus:  'he whose body is avyakta' (su. u., 7) , 'the avyakta merges into aksara, the aksara into tamas' (ibid., 2) , and also 'there was tamas , the intelligence was concealed by tamas' (tai. br., 1.8.9)",

  "prakrtim etc.  taking hold of my own nature :  by this much  [of statement]  it is explained that this host of beings, though itself insentient,  attains luminosity as it is linked to the absolute nature of  [consciousness]",
  "thus avastabhya, keeping under control , svam, my own , prakrtim, prakrti, which is charcterized as nescience , visrjami, i project forth , punah, punah, again and again , the krtsnam, whole of , imam, this , existing bhuta-gramam, multitude of beings which are born of prakrti , which, being under another's sub-jugation due to such defects [see under 8.19, introductory commentary.-tr.] as ignorance etc., are avasam, powerless, not independent , prakrteh vasat, under the influence of their own nature. 'in that case, you, who are the supreme god and who ordain this multitude of beings uneally, will become associated with virtue and vice as a result of that act?' in aswer the lord says this'",
  "these acts do not bind me, o arjuna, sitting like one indifferent, unattached to those acts",
  "but these acts of mine do not bind me. i remain outside and unattached",
  "o dhananjaya !  these acts do not bind me, remaining as if unconcerned and unattached in these actions",
  "but these actions do not bind me, o arjuna, for i remain detached from them like one unconcerned",
  "o dhananjaya (arjuna), nor do those actions bind me, remaining (as i do) like one unconcerned with, and unattached to, those actions",
  "but actions like uneal creation do not bind me. there can be no imputation of cruelty etc., to me, because the previous actions (karmas) of individual selves are the causes for the ineality of conditions like that of gods etc. i am untouched by the ineality. i sit, as it were, apart from it as one unconcerned. accordingly, the author of the vedanta-sutras says:  'not ineality and cruelty, on account of (creation) being dependent, for so scripture declares' (br. su., 2.1.34), and 'if it be said that there is no karma on account of non-distinction, it is replied that it is not proper to say so, because it is beginningless ৷৷.' (ibid., 2.1.35). [the idea is this:  creation has no first beginning. it is an eternal cyclic process of creation and dissolution of the universe. so the differentiation of karma, jiva and isvara even before creation has to be accepted. only in the creative cycle the differentiation becomes patent, and in the dissolved condition it remains latent.]",
  "o dhananjaya, na ca, nor do , tani, those , karmani, actions-which are the sources of the creation of the multitude of beings uneally , nibadhnanti, bind , mam, me, who am god. as to that, the lord states the reason for his not becoming associated with the actions: asinam, remaining (as i do) , udasinavat, like one unconcerned, like some indifferent spectator- for the self is not subject to any change , and asaktam, unattached , tesu karmasu, to those actions-free from attachment to results, free from the egoism that 'i do.' hence, even int he case of any other person also, the absence of the idea of agentship and the absence of attachment to results are the causes of not getting bound. otherwise, like the silkworm, a foolish man becomes bound by acitons. this is the idea. there (in th previous two verses) it involves a contradiction to say, 'remaining like one unconcerned, i project forth this multitude of beings.' in order to dispel this doubt the lord says:"
